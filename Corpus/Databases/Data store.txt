***Data store***
A  data store  is a repository for persistently storing and managing collections of data which include not just repositories like databases, but also simpler store types such as simple files, emails etc. A database is a series of bytes that is managed by a database management system (DBMS). A file is a series of bytes that is managed by a file system. Thus, any database or file is a series of bytes that, once stored, is called a data store.
 MATLAB and Cloud Storage systems like VMware, Firefox OS use  datastore  as a term for abstracting collections of data inside their respective applications.
