***(a,b)-tree***
In computer science, an  (a,b) tree  is a kind of balanced search tree.
 An (a,b)-tree has all of its leaves at the same depth, and all internal nodes except for the root have between  a  and  b  children, where  a  and  b  are integers such that  2 ≤  a  ≤ ( b +1)/2 . The root has, if it is not a leaf, between 2 and  b  children.
 

 **Definition**

 Let  a ,  b  be positive integers such that  2 ≤  a  ≤ ( b +1)/2 . Then a rooted tree  T  is an (a,b)-tree when:
 
 Every inner node except the root has at least  a  and at most  b  children. 
 The root has at most  b  children. 
 All paths from the root to the leaves are of the same length.
