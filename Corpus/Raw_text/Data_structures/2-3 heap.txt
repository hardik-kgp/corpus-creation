***2-3 heap***
In computer science, a  2–3 heap  is a data structure, a variation on the heap, designed by Tadao Takaoka in 1999. The structure is similar to the Fibonacci heap, and borrows from the 2–3 tree.
 Time costs for some common heap operations are:
 
 Delete-min  takes O(log⁡(n))    amortized time. 
 Decrease-key  takes constant amortized time. 
 Insertion  takes constant amortized time.
