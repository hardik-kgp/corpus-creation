***Bidirectional map***
In computer science, a  bidirectional map , or  hash bag , is an associative data structure in which the    ( k e y , v a l u e ) 
    pairs form a one-to-one correspondence. Thus the binary relation is functional in each direction: each    v a l u e 
    can also be mapped to a unique    k e y 
   . A pair( a , b ) 
    thus provides a unique coupling between    a 
    and    b 
    so that    b 
    can be found when    a 
    is used as a key and    a 
    can be found when    b 
    is used as a key.
 Mathematically, a  bidirectional map  can be defined a bijection    f : X â†’ Y 
    between two different sets of keys    X 
    and    Y 
    of equal cardinality, thus constituting a injective and surjective function:
