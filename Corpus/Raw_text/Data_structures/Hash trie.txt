***Hash trie***
In computer science,  hash trie  can refer to:
 
 Hash tree (persistent data structure), a trie used to map hash values to keys 
 A space-efficient implementation of a sparse trie, in which the descendants of each node may be interleaved in memory. (The name is suggested by a similarity to a closed hash table.)  
 A data structure which "combines features of hash tables and LC-tries (Least Compression tries) in order to perform efficient lookups and updates"
