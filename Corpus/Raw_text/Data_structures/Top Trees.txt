***Top Trees***
A  top tree  is a data structure based on a binary tree for unrooted dynamic trees that is used mainly for various path-related operations. It allows simple divide-and-conquer algorithms. It has since been augmented to maintain dynamically various properties of a tree such as diameter, center and median.
 A top tree  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    is defined for an  underlying tree   
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    and a set  
   
     
       
         ∂ 
         
           T 
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle \partial {T}} 
    of at most two vertices called as External Boundary Vertices

 **Introduction**

 Top trees  are used for maintaining a Dynamic forest (set of trees) under link and cut operations.
 The basic idea is to maintain a balanced Binary tree  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    of logarithmic height in the number of nodes in the original tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
   ( i.e. in  
   
     
       
         
           
             O 
           
         
         ( 
         log 
         ⁡ 
         n 
         ) 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(\log n)} 
    time) ; the  top tree  essentially represents the recursive subdivision of the original tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    into clusters . 
 In general the tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    may have weight on its edges.
 There is a one-to-one correspondence with the edges of the original tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    and the leaf nodes of the top tree  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    and each internal node of  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    represents a cluster that is formed due to the union of the clusters that are its children.
 The top tree data structure can be initialized in  
   
     
       
         
           
             O 
           
         
         ( 
         n 
         ) 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(n)} 
    time.
 Therefore the top tree  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    over ( 
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
         , 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}},} 
     
   
     
       
         ∂ 
         
           T 
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle \partial {T}} 
   ) is a binary tree such that
 
 The nodes of  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    are clusters of ( 
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
         , 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}},} 
     
   
     
       
         ∂ 
         
           T 
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle \partial {T}} 
    ); 
 The leaves of  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    are the edges of  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
         ; 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}};} 
   
 Sibling clusters are neighbours in the sense that they intersect in a single vertex, and then their parent cluster is their union. 
 Root of  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    is the tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    itself, with a set of at most two External Boundary Vertices. A tree with a single vertex has an empty top tree, and one with just an edge is just a single node.
 These trees are freely augmentable allowing the user a wide variety of flexibility and productivity without going into the details of the internal workings of the data structure, something which is also referred to as the  Black Box .
 

 **Dynamic Operations**

 The following three are the user allowable Forest Updates.

     Expose({v,w})  fails if the vertices are from different trees. 

 **Internal Operations**

 The Forest updates are all carried out by a sequence of at most  
   
     
       
         
           
             O

         log 
         ⁡ 
         n 
         ) 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(\log n)} 
    Internal Operations, the sequence of which is computed in further  
   
     
       
         
           
             O

     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(\log n)} 
    time.  It may happen that during a tree update, a leaf  cluster may change to a path cluster and the converse. Updates to top tree are done exclusively by these internal operations.
 The  
   
     
       
         I 
         (

         ) 
       
     
     {\displaystyle I({\mathcal {C}})}

    operation which for a root (nonleaf) cluster selects one of its child clusters. The top tree blackbox provides  Search

    routine, which organizes  Choose  queries and reorganization of the top tree (using the Internal operations) such that it locates the only edge in intersection of all selected clusters. Sometimes the search should be limited to a path. There is a variant of nonlocal search for such purposes.
If there are two external boundary vertices in the root cluster

     {\displaystyle \pi ({\mathcal {C}})}

 Similar task could be formulated for graph with edges with nonunit lengths. In that case the distance could address an edge or a vertex between two edges. We could define Choose such that the edge leading to the vertex is returned in the latter case. There could be defined update increasing all edge lengths along a path by a constant. In such scenario these updates are done in constant time just in root cluster.  Clean  is required to distribute the delayed update to the children. The  Clean  should be called before the  Search  is invoked. To maintain length in  
   
     
       
         I 
       
     
     {\displaystyle I} 
    would in that case require to maintain unitlength in  
   
     
       
         I 
       
     
     {\displaystyle I}

 **Interesting Results and Applications**

 A number of interesting applications originally implemented by other methods have been easily implemented using the top tree's interface. Some of them include
 
 ([SLEATOR AND TARJAN 1983]). We can maintain a dynamic collection of weighted trees in  
   
     
       
         
           
             O 
           
         
         ( 
         log 
         ⁡ 
         n 
         ) 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(\log n)} 
    time per link and cut, supporting queries about the maximum edge weight between any two vertices in  
   
     
       
         O 
         ( 
         log 
         ⁡

    time.
 Proof outline: It involves maintaining at each node the maximum weight (max_wt) on its cluster path, if it is a point cluster then max_wt( 
   
     
       
         
           
             C

   ) is initialised as

         . 
       
     
     {\displaystyle -\infty .} 
    When a cluster is a union of two clusters then it is the maximum value of the two merged clusters. If we have to find the max wt between  
   
     
       
         v 
       
     
     {\displaystyle v} 
    and  
   
     
       
         w 
       
     
     {\displaystyle w}

    and report max_wt

 Top trees can be used to compress trees in a way that is never much worse than DAG compression, but may be exponentially better. 

 **Implementation**

 Top trees have been implemented in a variety of ways, some of them include implementation using a  Multilevel Partition  (Top-trees and dynamic graph algorithms Jacob Holm and Kristian de Lichtenberg. Technical Report), and even by using Sleator-Tarjan s-t trees (typically with amortized time bounds), Frederickson's Topology Trees (with worst case time bounds) (Alstrup et al. Maintaining Information in Fully Dynamic Trees with Top Trees).
 Amortized implementations are more simple, and with small multiplicative factors in time complexity.
On the contrary the worst case implementations allow speeding up queries by switching off unneeded info updates during the query (implemented by persistence techniques). After the query is answered the original state of the top tree is used and the query version is discarded.
 

 **Using Multilevel Partitioning**

 Any partitioning of clusters of a tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    can be represented by a Cluster Partition Tree CPT 
   
     
       
         ( 
         
           
             T 
           
         
         ) 
         , 
       
     
     {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {T}}),} 
    by replacing each cluster in the tree  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    by an edge. If we use a strategy P for partitioning  
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} 
    then the CPT would be CPT P 
   
     
       
         
           
             T 
           
         
         . 
       
     
     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}.} 
    This is done recursively till only one edge remains.
 We would notice that all the nodes of the corresponding top tree  
   
     
       
         ℜ 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Re } 
    are uniquely mapped into the edges of this multilevel partition. There may be some edges in the multilevel partition that do not correspond to any node in the top tree, these are the edges which represent only a single child in the level below it, i.e. a simple cluster. Only the edges that correspond to composite clusters correspond to nodes in the top tree

 The number of edges in subsequent levels should decrease by a constant factor. 
 If a lower level is changed by an update then we should be able to update the one immediately above it using at most a constant number of insertions and deletions. The above partitioning strategy ensures the maintenance of the top tree in
