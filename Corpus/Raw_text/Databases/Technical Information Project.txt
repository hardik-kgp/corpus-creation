***Technical Information Project***
The  Technical Information Project  (TIP) was an early database project. TIP included over 25,000 records and was used to explore bibliographic coupling between works.
 Developed by Meyer Mike Kessler at MIT around 1964, some of the innovations in TIP included the use of wild cards, and boolean searching.
