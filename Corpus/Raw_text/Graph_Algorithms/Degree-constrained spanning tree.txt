***Degree-constrained spanning tree***
In graph theory, a  degree-constrained spanning tree  is a spanning tree where the maximum vertex degree is limited to a certain constant  k . The  degree-constrained spanning tree problem  is to determine whether a particular graph has such a spanning tree for a particular  k .
 

 **Formal definition**

 Input:  n -node undirected graph G(V,E); positive integer  k  ≤  n .
 Question: Does G have a spanning tree in which no node has degree greater than  k ?
 

 **NP-completeness**

 This problem is NP-complete (Garey & Johnson 1979). This can be shown by a reduction from the Hamiltonian path problem. It remains NP-complete even if  k  is fixed to a value ≥ 2. If the problem is defined as the degree must be ≤  k , the  k  = 2 case of degree-confined spanning tree is the Hamiltonian path problem.
 

 **Degree-constrained minimum spanning tree**

 On a weighted graph, a Degree-constrained minimum spanning tree (DCMST) is a degree-constrained spanning tree in which the sum of its edges has the minimum possible sum. Finding a DCMST is an NP-Hard problem. Heuristic algorithms that can solve the problem in polynomial time have been proposed, including Genetic and Ant-Based Algorithms.
 

 **Approximation Algorithm**

 Fürer & Raghavachari (1994) give an iterative polynomial time algorithm which, given a graph  
   
     
       
         G 
       
     
     {\displaystyle G} 
   , returns a spanning tree with maximum degree no larger than  
   
     
       
         
           Δ 
           
             ∗ 
           
         
         + 
         1 
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Delta ^{*}+1} 
   , where  
   
     
       
         
           Δ 
           
             ∗ 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle \Delta ^{*}} 
    is the minimum possible maximum degree over all spanning trees. Thus, if  
   
     
       
         k 
         = 
         
           Δ 
           
             ∗ 
           
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle k=\Delta ^{*}} 
   , such an algorithm will either return a spanning tree of maximum degree  
   
     
       
         k 
       
     
     {\displaystyle k} 
    or  
   
     
       
         k 
         + 
         1 
       
     
     {\displaystyle k+1} 
   .
