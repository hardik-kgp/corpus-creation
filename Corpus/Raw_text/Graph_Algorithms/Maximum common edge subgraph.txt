***Maximum common edge subgraph***
Given two graphs  
   
     
       
         G 
       
     
     {\displaystyle G} 
    and  
   
     
       
         
           G 
           ′ 
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle G'} 
   , the  maximum common edge subgraph problem  is the problem of finding a graph  
   
     
       
         H 
       
     
     {\displaystyle H} 
    with as many  edges as possible which is isomorphic to both a subgraph of  
   
     
       
         G 
       
     
     {\displaystyle G} 
    and a subgraph of  
   
     
       
         
           G 
           ′ 
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle G'} 
   .
 The maximum common edge subgraph problem on general graphs is NP-complete as it is a generalization of subgraph isomorphism: a graph  
   
     
       
         H 
       
     
     {\displaystyle H} 
    is isomorphic to a subgraph of another graph  
   
     
       
         G 
       
     
     {\displaystyle G} 
    if and only if the maximum common edge subgraph of  
   
     
       
         G 
       
     
     {\displaystyle G} 
    and  
   
     
       
         H 
       
     
     {\displaystyle H} 
    has the same number of edges as  
   
     
       
         H 
       
     
     {\displaystyle H} 
   . Unless the two inputs  
   
     
       
         G 
       
     
     {\displaystyle G} 
    and  
   
     
       
         
           G 
           ′ 
         
       
     
     {\displaystyle G'} 
    to the maximum common edge subgraph problem are required to have the same number of vertices, the problem is APX-hard.
