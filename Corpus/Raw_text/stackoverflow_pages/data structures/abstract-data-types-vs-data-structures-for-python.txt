 The way I understand it, you use data structures to implement abstract data types.  
 Am I correct in saying that you can implement stacks, queues, dictionaries, and tuples with lists? If so, does this mean that stacks, queues, dictionaries, and tuples are ADTs and lists are data structures?  
 Are strings also ADTs that are implemented by a list of chars?  
 And how are lists implemented in Python? In Java, you need to implement a List interface with LinkedList or ArrayList, etc. But in Python, it seems you can just straight up use a list like an int or an array in Java.
