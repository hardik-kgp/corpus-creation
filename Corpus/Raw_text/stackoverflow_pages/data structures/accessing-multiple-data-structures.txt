*** accessing-multiple-data-structures ***

 I am writing a text-based adventure game in Haskell for experience after reading LYAH, but I need help writing a function in which two data structures (in this case two players) are accessed and another structure (another [attacked] player) is returned. Thanks! 
 
 
 Pattern matching or any of (many) other ways you can write a two-argument function?  In addition you have various syntax that is only available to record types. 
 
 Please do research before posting on SO.  The 3 "standard" beginner texts already explain this.
