 I'm looking for a C library with common reusable data structures like linked lists, hash tables etc. Something like the source distributed with  Mastering Algorithms with C (Paperback) by Kyle Loudon . 
 
 BSD  queue.h  has: 
 
 SLIST = singly linked list 
 LIST = doubly linked list 
 SIMPLEQ = singly linked queue 
 TAILQ = doubly linked queue 
 
 BSD  tree.h  has: 
 
 RB - red-black tree 
 SPLAY - splay tree 
 
 See the  queue(3)  and  tree(3)  man pages for details.  I really like them because they are pure C macros without dependencies (not even libc).  Plus with the BSD license you don't have to worry about any company restrictions w/ GPL. 
 
 Gnome provides an excellent library for this, called  Glib , with many useful data structures and other utilities as well. 
 
 gnulib , the gnu portability library. 
 It's distributed as source code.
This list is from its  module list , which includes a TON of other things. One interesting one is "c-stack: Stack overflow handling, causing program exit." 
 
 list 
 array-list  
 carray-list 
 linked-list 
 avltree-list 
 rbtree-list 
 linkedhash-list 
 avltreehash-list 
 rbtreehash-list 
 sublist ( Sequential list data type backed by another list. ) 
 oset (Abstract ordered set.) 
 array-oset 
 avltree-oset 
 rbtree-oset 
 
 
 SGLIB  is an excellent generic data-structures library. The library currently provides generic implementations for:  
sorting arrays  
linked lists  
sorted linked lists  
double linked lists  
red-black trees  
hashed containers  
 It's very fast, faster than glib.  It's inspired by the Standard Template Library.  Download Here 
 Another solution is  Attractive Chaos software . 
C macro library:  
kbtree.h: efficient B-tree library in C. 
khash.h: fast and light-weighted hash table library in C. 
kvec.h: simple vector container in C. 
 Sglib and Attractive Chaos software are C macros library. Using void* to implement generic containers in C may be inefficient. C macros mimics C++ template and are as efficient  as C++ template 
 
 The GDSL Library might be a good thing to consider:

 The Apache Portable Runtime. 
 
 CLIB 
 
 AT&T's  software tools .
