*** assign-multiple-values-to-multiple-data-structures ***

 I was wondering what would be the best / efficient way to assign multiple values to 5 different instances of the same data structure (all the data structures are the same). 
 My Data Structure: 
 
 So for example, my values for minTemperature are currently in a number array with length 5 that contains the minimum temperature for each day. In other words, each instance of the data structure represents one day.  
 Is there a way for me to assign the ith element of that array to the minTemperature of the ith data structure? This will have to be done for the other fields of the data structure as well (date, city, country, ...) 
 
 I'll give you two answers as intuition tells me you're probably better suited with an interface in this case:  
 **With the given class:**
  
 
 
 
 
 
 However, as noted earlier, if you don't plan on having any member methods to your WeatherData class an interface will probably suit you better - essentially a constrained, type-checked object.
