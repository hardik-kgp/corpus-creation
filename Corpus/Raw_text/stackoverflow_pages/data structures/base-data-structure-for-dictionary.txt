 You could read the  documentation  Dictionary uses a   internally: 
 
 The   generic class provides a mapping from a set of keys to a set of values. Each addition to the dictionary consists of a value and its associated key. Retrieving a value by using its key is very fast, close to O(1), because the   class is implemented as a  **hash table.**
