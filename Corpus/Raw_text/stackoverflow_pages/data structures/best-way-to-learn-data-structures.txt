 I need to learn data structures through C for my school course.What's the best way to do it? I mean through books or writing code? 
 Thanks 
 
 Well, this is bad question so I will give answer, and not a comment. 
Of course, you have to write code and to read books together. But, there is another useful way to learn something. Try to write you own blog or book about structures in C. Then you will have to check all possible solutions, all nuances, to format your code perfectly and to explain in details all structures. That will improve your skills dramatically. 
Try to find someone with better skills and to ask questions. Maybe, clone someone's project or just read sources from github. 
And last, but not the least. Create your own big project. And use all your skill there. For example, write simple engine for arcade game. That will demand some knowledge in math.
