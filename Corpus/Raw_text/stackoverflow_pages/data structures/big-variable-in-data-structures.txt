*** big-variable-in-data-structures ***

 I am new with data structures and c-language. I came across this algorithm 
 
 does this statement mean that "'if' statement will end if big=b in situation of b being greater then big(or a as a=big) and henceforth. 
 also i wanted to know what is big as a variable used for and what it means as came across big-o and big-theta in data structures. thnx in advance   
 
 The above algorithm returns you the largest number among  a,b,c,d. It has nothing to do with  Big O and theta as these are related to complexities of an algorithm.
