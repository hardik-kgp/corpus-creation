*** c-sharp-data-structures ***

 I'm building an app in C#, however I'm new to the language though its pretty easy to learn because its too damn similar to Java. 
 However, I'm getting lost with the data structures as I haven't found a list of comprehensive available data structures with their methods like how Java has them. 
 Anyone has a reference list of available data structs for C# and their methods? 
 
 Most of the data structures you'll use in C# are contained in the  System.Collections.Generic namespace . There are some rarely used data structures in the  System.Collections.Specialized namespace . Also, there are some older, non-generic versions of data structures that are mostly deprecated since the introduction of generics in C# 2.0 available in the  System.Collections namespace . 
 Scott Mitchell has a nice introductory article set about some data structures in .NET:  An Extensive Examination of Data Structures Using C# 2.0 . 
 If you're coming from a Java background, you'll notice that unlike Java, .NET data structures are named after their function, not the way they are implemented. 
 
 You're going to love them. C# data structures combined with LINQ offer so much more than Java. Check out the  **System.Collections.Generic**
 namespace. One important note that almost any generic collection implements the  IEnumerable<T>  interface one way or other and you can LINQ to any IEnumerable<T> object: 
 
 Check out the  System.Linq.Enumerable  class for a complete list of what LINQ can do for you.

 Like the Java Collections, C# has a hierarchy of interfaces that includes collections (ICollection), lists (IList), and map (IDictionary) semantics.  It maps 1:1 onto java.util.collections, with the exception of java.util.Set.  There's no set in C# today.  ISet is supposed to be on the way in .NET 4.0.
