I have a data structure like this: 
 
 I have created a vector of Numbers like this: 
 
 How to use the stl sort algorithm, such that i sort the data structures based on the value? 
 
 You can use a functor too : 
 
 With C++11, you can use a lambda function : 
 
 
 You'll need to overload the "<" operator, like so:
