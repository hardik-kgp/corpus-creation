*** can-kernel-module-use-kernel-data-structures ***

 When writing a kernel module, can programmer make use of data structures, like task_group, task_struct, already defined in kernel? 
 
 Yes, after including corresponding header, kernel module can use anything that is  defined  in that header: data structures, macros, static inline functions... 
 As for functions,  declared  in the header file and  implemented  in kernel's source file, only those which are exported using EXPORT_SYMBOL/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL can be used in modules.
