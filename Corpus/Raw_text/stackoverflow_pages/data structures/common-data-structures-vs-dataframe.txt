*** common-data-structures-vs-dataframe ***

 The most common data structures are as far as I understand: 
 
 How about DataFrame? Is DataFrame a separate data structure or is is a mutation of some of the listed above? 
 
 Pandas DataFrame docs 
 
 **DataFrame**
 is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or  **a dict of Series objects**
. 
 
 It is basically a dict of Series objects. Now what are Series objects? 
 
 **Series**
 is a one-dimensional  **labeled array**
 capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. 
 
 These are labeled arrays 
 
 DataFrame is part of the   python data analysis library, and is comparable to a spreadsheet or an SQL table. It's not a native Python type, but a DataFrame can contain columns of different types. See  Pandas Dataframe docs
