 Lets say I have a hash of a hash e.g. 
 
 
 What would the 'usual' way to store such a data structure (or would you not?) 
 Would you be able to directly get a value (e.g. get harry : age ? 
 Once stored could you directly change the value of a sub key (e.g. sally : weight = 100)

  you not?) 
 
 For example harry and sally would be stored each in separate  hashes  where fields would represent their properties like age and weight. Then  set  structure would hold all the members (harry, sally, ...) which you have stored in redis.

 Yes, see  HGET  or  HMGET  or  HGETALL . 
 
 Once stored could you directly change the value of a sub key (e.g.
  sally : weight = 100) 
 
 Yes, see  HSET . 
 
 Lets take a complex data that we have to store in redis , 
for example this one: 
 
 The problem that we face is that the friends & logs are lists. 
So what we can do to represent this data in redis is use hashes and lists something like this : 
 **Option**
 1. A hash map with keys as user:1 and user:2 
 
 **Option**
 2: A hash map with dumped json data as string encode 
 
 **Option**
 3: This is another representation of #1  
 
 Please , correct me if i m wrong.  
 
 Depends on what you want to do, but if your datastructure is not deeper nested and you need access to each field, I would recommend using hashes:  http://redis.io/commands#hash
