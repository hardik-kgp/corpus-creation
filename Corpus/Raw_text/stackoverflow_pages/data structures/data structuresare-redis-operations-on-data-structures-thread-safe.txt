 How does Redis handle multiple threads (from different clients) updating the same data structure in Redis ? What is the recommended best practice for such a use case?  
 
 if you read the Little redis book at some point this sentence comes.  
 "You might not know it, but  **Redis is actually single-threaded**
, which is how every command is guaranteed to be atomic.
 **While one command is executing, no other command will run**
." 
 Have a look in  http://openmymind.net/2012/1/23/The-Little-Redis-Book/  for more information
