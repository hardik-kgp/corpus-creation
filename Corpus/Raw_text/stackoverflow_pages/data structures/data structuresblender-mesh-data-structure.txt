*** blender-mesh-data-structure ***

 Does anyone know what data structure blender is using? Like Half-Edge / Winged Edge / Shared Vertext / Directed Edge etc. 
 I should prepare a presentation for my university about different data structures. As we're using Blender, I think, I should at least know that about Blender. I also did google it, but it seems like no one knows anything about that.
