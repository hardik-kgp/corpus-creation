 Generic data structure libraries for C?   
 
 Starting off in C programming and wondering if anyone is aware of any library containing implementations of data structures such as linked list, hash maps etc ? 
 
 glib.  Hard to use if you're just-starting-off because you actually have to know how to get around in pointers. 
 It's reasonably standard for applications that want to use that sort of thing (excuse the wishy-washy opining). 
 An option I usually prefer is to wrap C++ STL with C APIs myself.  I don't know if there's a standard converter for this.  But this is because most developers I work with understand C++-to-C APIs (part of the corporate code landscape at my firm) and STL much better than glib, in which client code tends to be egregiously error prone.
