 What I don't understand is where the extra "movie" comes from in the two void printmovie function arguments. At first I thought it was supposed to be a function argument, but there isn't a comma separating it and "movies_t". Could you also explain how the printmovie function interacts with the movies_t data structure? 
 
  takes only one argument. 
  is the  **type**
 of the argument. 
  is the  **argument name**
. 
 The important thing to remember is that C++ is a statically typed language, and every variable has a type associated with it (for example:  ,  , or a user defined type such as  ). This isn't Python. 
 
  takes one argument. Its name is   and its type is  . 
 
 It is an argument. For example, you give an int parameter to a function like, 
 
 In the same way, struct is a user-defined data type, hence anything that uses the movies_t keyword becomes a variable of struct type with  the format defined under movie_t with a string called movies title and an int called year. So, effectively, that is what you are saying in the function header that the variable movie is a struct of the format defined in movie_t.
