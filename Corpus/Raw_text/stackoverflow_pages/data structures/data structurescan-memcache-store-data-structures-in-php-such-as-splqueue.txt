*** can-memcache-store-data-structures-in-php-such-as-splqueue ***

 I am trying to store splqueue to memcache (NOT memcached). The following sample code is a simple test for this purpose. 
 
 When I run this code, I got 2 in line a and 0 in line b. So it probably means storing data structure in memcache doesn't work. 
 So I have following three questions. 
 
 Did I do anything wrong or there is another way to store splqueue in memcache? 
 I also found SplObjectStorage for Spl data structures. Can this be a solution for my problem? 
 Can memcached (NOT memcache) store data structures? 
 
 
  will serialize non-scalar values.   does not appear to implement the SPL   interface, and so cannot be relied upon to serialize/unserialize correctly. You could extend  , implement  , and then construct some appropriate serialization/unserialization strategy for this purpose. 
  does implement  , and so I would expect it to come in and out of   properly. 
 For other SPL structures, you should check for implementation of  . 
 Hope this helps.
