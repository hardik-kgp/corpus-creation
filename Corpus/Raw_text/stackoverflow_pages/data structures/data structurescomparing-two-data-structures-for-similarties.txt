*** comparing-two-data-structures-for-similarties ***

 I'm trying to find an algorithm for checking similarities between two data entries. Say I have two data structures (fields in contact's list) with following data: 
 
 I got those entries from different providers,   synced his Google account, while   synced his Microsoft account, but I want my algorithm to tell me that both users know same guy (within some probability). 
 Does anyone know where should I look into? I've tried to find hashing algorithm that creates "unsafe" hashes, i.e. similar hashes for similar data, but that route wasn't productive. 
 
 The similarity of strings can be determined with the  Levenshtein distance . The strings should be prepared before the test, eg remove special character or split the string.
For data structures have a look at  How do you measure similarity between 2 series of data? 
 
 some keywords you could further look into: data similarity, distance/similarity measures (metrics), correlation, inexact matching.
