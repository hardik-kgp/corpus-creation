 There is a huge shift towards schemaless/NoSQL/document-oriented databases these days, that support the scenario you mentioned without losing scalability and perform well under high loads.  
 You might want to have a look at a few to better understand the concept. You can start with  Mongodb , apache couchdb, google BigTable/datastore (through app engine), and many others as per your need.
