 In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. My program has got errors when compiled on TurboC++. It is on thelearningpoint.net. It has 6 errors. Debug it. Kindly explain the code. 
 
 
 that's because there is a function called delete on line 38 but delete is a keyword in c++, rename the function! 
 EDIT: 
 as pointed out by my commenter you can also use the proper compiler
