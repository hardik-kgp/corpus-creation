*** define-data-structures-from-configuration-files ***

 I'm not new to C programming but I havn't got the chance to touch it for a lot of time. 
 I'd like your advice on a way to define data structures (struct) which are defined in a configuration file.  At the moment, I haven't defined the structure for the configuration file but I'm guessing it will be something like ini file. 
 Basically I'm working on Windows and Linux so I'd love an answer for both OS.

 The simplest method, by far, would be to use header ( ) files as your configuration files. You could include them into your project like so: 
 
 ... and introduce them during compilation like so: 
 
 If you wrap all of your config values into function-like-macros from the very start, this should be nice and flexible; you shouldn't have a problem generating clean  s from your INI files.

 I should point out that in the world of C,  define  has a  very strict  meaning, and to  define data structures (struct)  can only be done in C source files (or header files, which are later included into source files). 
 Suit yourself! My recommendation would give you an interface that allows you to put the lexing/parsing on hold until a (much) later point in time (i.e. when you have the time to write a full-fledged INI-to-C-header compiler, because that's what you're asking about), and give you an interface with which to  fill in the blanks , so to say.
