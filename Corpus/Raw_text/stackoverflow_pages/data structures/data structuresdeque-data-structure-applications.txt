*** deque-data-structure-applications ***

 When we can insert and delete from both ends, why is it called a deque? Also, what are the applications of a deque?  
 I'm a student studying data structures for the first time. Thanks! 
 
 It's also known as the double-ended queue.  It's called this because it provides a generalized queue which we can modify from both the head or the tail.  Hence, double-ended. 
 **When should we use one?**

Whenever we want fast access to inserts and deletes at both the beginning and the end.  Scheduling and modeling real life queues are common examples.
