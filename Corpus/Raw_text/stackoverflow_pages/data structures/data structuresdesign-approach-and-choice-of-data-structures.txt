 This is a very general question.  
 
 What should be the general choice of data structures to solve questions of these kind as part of Design Questions (OO or algorithm design). By 'these', I mean, multiple values and multiple query formats. 
 
 Personally, I would use a dictionary whose keys are pages and values are a list of 2-tuples representing the user and the number of visits made by that user. But since this question is so incredibly general, it's tough to say. 
 For example: 
 
 The next visit, that number would be incremented. 
 This has a few advantages. Since users are visiting pages and not pages visiting users, you store one object, rather than several. You can easily get things like total page visits by adding up visits to each page.
There are a fixed number of pages and a potentially unlimited number of users.
