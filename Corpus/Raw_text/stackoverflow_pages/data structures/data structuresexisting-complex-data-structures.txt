*** existing-complex-data-structures ***

 is there a data structure like a set which can take different types as parameters? or do I have to create my own class? 
an example to clarify...something like 
 DataStructure  mydatastruct = new DataStructure   () 
 I'm I asking too much? :P  
 I meant something like this..I dont know why is not showing like I'm actually writing it  
 
 
 Yes, they are called  Generics . 
 
 You probably mean the datastructure called   in other languages. They don't exist in Java. 
 In C++ you have the generic (aka. template) class called   which implements your example above for 2 types, but this doesn't exist either in Java. However it is pretty easy to implement it yourself if you need such functionality often.
