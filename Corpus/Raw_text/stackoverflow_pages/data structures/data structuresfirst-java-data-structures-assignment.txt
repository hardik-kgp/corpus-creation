*** first-java-data-structures-assignment ***

 edit - I revised my code and replaced my original work with new code, still having similar issues 
 This data structures class I'm taking is my first programming course, so I'm a bit out of my element. The first project is really kicking my ass. It is to make a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator. It is more or less complete, just a lot of bugs. I have been spending hours tweaking my code but when I address one problem it unleashes another. I apologize in advance for my horrible programming skills. 
 public class ReversePolishStack { 
 
 } 
 I have been at this for awhile and I'm sure with every attempt at fixing a bug I also added to the convolution that is my code. Any help would be appreciated! 
 
 First of all you should take out from the main method the classes you have defined.
After that you'll get an error because an instance of the class   ( ) has been created without creating the outer class ( ). 
 See as reference  this link about nested classes . 
 I also put the   class into the   class (btw you should rename this class as   with the first letter capitalized). 
 I didn't get into the logic of your code but at least after these fixes your code will compile: 
 
 I also suggest you to extract the logic of your program from your main method and create methods in the   in order to use the oop concepts. 
 Hope this was useful!
Ciao!
