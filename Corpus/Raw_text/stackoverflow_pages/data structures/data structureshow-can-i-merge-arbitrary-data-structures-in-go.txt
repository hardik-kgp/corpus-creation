*** how-can-i-merge-arbitrary-data-structures-in-go ***

 I have a situation where I have two data structures.  Each is statically typed as an   and can either be an int, string, slice, or map.  The function should be able to merge these two data structures together, except in some cases (for instance, you can't merge a string with a map).  I've written the following code which works, but I'm wondering if there is a more elegant approach.
