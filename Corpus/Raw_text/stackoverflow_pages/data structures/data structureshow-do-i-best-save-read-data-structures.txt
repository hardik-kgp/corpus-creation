*** how-do-i-best-save-read-data-structures ***

 I want to write some data structures pointed to by   and   to a file, and to read the data structures back into the symbols   and   when I start a new session of Common Lisp. 
 It would appear   allows objects to be printed in a fashion that can be read back in by  , and I can change how objects are printed using  . Since the objects should be printed in a way acceptable to  , I shouldn't have to define any further methods for reading the object back in. 
 But is there a way to tie each written data structure to its corresponding symbol, without having to rely on the order the data structures are written and read in? 
 
 If I understand correctly, you could store the values and associated symbols as pairs in the file, so something like this: 
 
 And when you parse it out, use something like this:
