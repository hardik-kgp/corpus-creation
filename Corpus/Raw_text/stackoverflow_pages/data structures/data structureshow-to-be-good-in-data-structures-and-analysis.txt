*** how-to-be-good-in-data-structures-and-analysis ***

 I want to be good in Data Structures and Analysis esp. in Java. I often find myself very weak. What should I do to be good in it? Any good mental exercises? 
 
 An excellent book on complexity analysis, including the properties of popular and not-so-popular data structures, is  Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition , also referred to as CLRS.  It's widely considered to be the bible of algorithms and their analysis. 
 For something more Java-centric, my undergraduate intro Java course used  this book , and I found it to be adequate. 
 For mental exercises, you might familiarize yourself through practice.  Try  Project Euler ,  TopCoder , or google  "acm practice problem" .  This is perhaps the thing that will give you the most tangible benefits in everyday coding.  Most all of these will accept and evaluate Java (and C/C++) solutions, so you're all set on the language front. 
 
 For the analysis of the data structures, you need to study discrete mathematics (combinatorics) and statistics. 
 
 Normally I would recommend  CLRS , but since you specifically called out Java in your question, I recommend  Objects, Abstraction, Data Structures and Design: Using Java version 5.0 .  It has really fantastic explanations of data structures and the algorithms that make them work. 
 
 Algorithms in Java, by  R. Sedgewick  is a very good book on algorithms, with java implementations.
