*** how-to-simplify-creating-huge-data-structures-in-python ***

 I am writing some and I need to pass a complicated data structure to some function. 
 The data structure goes like this: 
 
 This structure looks pretty ugly to me. Can you think of ways how to simplify writing such massive data structures? 
 PS. I made up this structure but my real structure is very similar tho. 
 
 Other languages would solve this problem with objects or structs-- so, something like: 
 
 Of course, this only works if you know ahead of time what form the data is going to take. If you don't, then maps/lists are your only choice ;-) 
 
 
 Use objects. You are working with basic types like strings and dictionaries while objects are more powerful. 
 Use function arguments. You can pass the the first-level keys in your dictionary as arguments to your function: 
 
 
def yourfunction(animals, fruits)
    # do things with fruits and animals
    pass
