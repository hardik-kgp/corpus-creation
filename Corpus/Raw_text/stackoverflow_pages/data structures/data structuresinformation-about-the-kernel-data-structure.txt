*** information-about-the-kernel-data-structure ***

 I came around this word kernel data structures while reading. 
 Tried to find information about this, but could'nt. 
 Wondering  
 
 What are kernel data structures? 
 Its requirement, usage, access? 
 Organization of kernel data structure inside the kernel 
 
 Example of kernel data structures might be file_operations or c_dev. 
 Suggest some materials to refer about this, if naive. 
 Thanks
