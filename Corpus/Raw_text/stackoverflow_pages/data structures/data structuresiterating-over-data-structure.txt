*** iterating-over-data-structure ***

 I am trying to iterate over this data structure: 
 
 where   is increasing.  It's several files I am processing so the number of   varies. 
 I thought this might work but it doesn't seem to be stepping up the   var:  
 
 I'm totally digging data structures but this one is stumping me. Any advice what might be wrong here? 
 
 $iter is being set to the content of each item in the array  not  the index. e.g. 
 
 ...prints: 
 
 Try: 
 
 
  is not going to be an index that you can subscript the array with, it is rather the current element of the array. So I guess you should be fine with: 
 
 
 Your $iter contains the data sctructure. What you basiclly want is: 
 
 or: 
 
 
 Since you are looping over the array, your misnamed   is the value you are looking for, not an index.
If you want to loop over the indexes instead, do: 
 
 Also note that you can drop   between two   or  : 
 
 I recommend reading  http://perlmonks.org/?node=References+quick+reference . 
 
 When you have ugly data structures like this, make an interface for it so your life is easier:  
 
 Even without that, consider using a reference to just the part of the data structure you need so you don't think about the rest: 
 
 It's just a reference, so you're not recreating anything. Since you only have to think about the parts beyond the   key, the problem doesn't look as hard.
