*** java-library-with-more-data-structures ***

 Can anyone point me to some good Java library (jar) that has some more data structures other than what comes as part of standard Java language. I want support for things like - Tuple, Pair, Tries, Binomial/Fibonacci trees and may be Graphs. [Yes, I know writing them on my own will be lot of fun, but I am reluctant to reinvent the wheel right now] 
 
 Guava  has a number of additional data structures, as well as the  Apache Commons Collections library . 
 
 I am not aware of any single Java library that contains all of those components. There is however a very good library called  **JGraphT**
 which provides a very nice and comprehensive API for graphs in Java. It also includes some structures that are related to that such as a   class. They also have a very comprehensive  JavaDoc . The feature list from the JGraphT website lists: 
 
 
 **directed**
 and  **undirected**
 graphs.  
 graphs with  **weighted**
 /  **unweighted**
 / labeled or any user-defined edges.  
 various edge multiplicity options, including:  **simple-graphs**
,  **multigraphs**
,  **pseudographs**
.  
 **unmodifiable**
 graphs - allow modules to provide "read-only" access to internal graphs.  
 **listenable**
 graphs - allow external listeners to track modification events.  
 **subgraphs**
 graphs that are auto-updating subgraph views on other graphs.  
 all compositions of above graphs. 
 
 
 
 The  prefuse  library/framework has most (all? maybe not pair) of those, even though it's a visualization library (and a really nice one at that).
