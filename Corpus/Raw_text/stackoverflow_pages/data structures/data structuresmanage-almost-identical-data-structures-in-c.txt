*** manage-almost-identical-data-structures-in-c ***

 With the following (simplified) data definition : 
 
 At one given point I must create an array of these structures and process them.  
 The processing is exactly the same except for the arrays (different length). Right now it's something like: 
 
 Right now I have the same function duplicated for each data classs. Is there a way around duplicating code when using these data structures?  
 Notes: 
 
 Only pure C, no C++; 
 I cannot change the data definition (i.e. cannot use   in the struct). 
 When processing I receive the type of data to process (0 for class0, 1 for class1, ...).  
 
 
 
 allocate with  something like that: 
 
 define  
 
 or if you parametrize the DIM

 or 
 
 Not perfect, but not too weird a construct to not be usable. 
 EDIT:
The ELEMENT define should be changed to  
 
 with this change, your arrayVar field can be of any type and is not limited to elements of size 1. 
 
 Can't you just make the array dynamic? So that you create your structures with   and then initialize some member to hold the size (and make sure it ends with an   instead of an actual array, or use VLA's)? 
 
 It depends whether or not you want to fill the arrays with different values initially. Otherwise you can just have a macro that initializes both types of structures 
 
 and use that as 
 
 your array components would then always be   initialized, regardless of their size. 
 To initialize an  ed array of your stuff: 
 
 BTW, prefer to initialize variables properly and don't cast the return of  .
