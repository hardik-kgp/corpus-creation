 What are some more interesting  graph data structures  for working with networks?   I am interested in structures which may offer some particular advantage in terms of traversing the network, finding random nodes, size in memory or for insertion/deletion/temporary hiding of nodes for example. 
 Note: I'm not so much interested in database like designs for addressing external memory problems. 
 
 One of my personal favorites is the  link/cut tree , a data structure for partitioning a graph into a family of directed trees.  This lets you solve network flow problems asymptotically faster than more traditional methods and can be used as a more powerful generalization of the union/find structure you may have heard of before. 
 
 I've heard of Skip Graphs (  http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=skip+graphs  ), a probabilistic graph structure that is - as far as I know - already in use in some peer-to-peer applications. 
 These graphs are kind of self-organizing and their goal is to achieve a good connectivity and a small diameter. There is a distributed algorithm that tries to achieve such graphs:  http://www14.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/personen/jacob/Publications/podc09.pdf
