 What algorithms libraries can you recommend? The basic criteria are: 
 
 Capabilities 
 Object Oriented Design 
 Performance 
 
 Algorithms libraries I have used and can recommend: 
 
 QuickGraph  - for graph algorithms 
 C5  - for data structures that have not been included in .NET framework 
 NetTopologySuite  - for spatial processing and algorithms 
 
 I haven't found any good text/string algorithm library and 2D Geometry library. 
 
 Aumplib  namespace for Audio Conversion 
 
 Wintellect's Power Collections 
 
 NCalc - C# embedable extensible mathematical expression library 
 
 SharpMap - Geospacial application framework for the CLR   
 
 You can also check out my open source project, called NList. It is found at  http://nlist.codeplex.com . 
 NList has a library of algorithms similar to those provided by C++'s STL, but geared for.NET development. It also has a powerful text generator similar to handlebars.js. NList has one of the best custom comparison builders out there. There's a class for treating an object like a dictionary of its properties. There's a default dictionary class. There's also a conversion method that "just works". Plus there are a few other collection wrappers.
