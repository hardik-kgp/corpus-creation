*** reference-unit-tests-for-common-data-structures ***

 I'm writing a class library that contains several specialized implementations of common data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries...). I find myself always writing the same unit tests over and over, and I'm never sure I'm not forgetting to test some important scenarios. 
 Since my classes all implement standard interfaces ( ,  , etc), I was wondering if there were some kind of "reference" unit tests that all implementations of these interfaces should pass. Of course I would also need to test the specific aspects of my classes, but at least I would be more confident that there is nothing broken in my implementation of the standard interfaces. 
 
 You could have a look at the  Mono unit tests on Github  - there is at least   and   tests there already.
