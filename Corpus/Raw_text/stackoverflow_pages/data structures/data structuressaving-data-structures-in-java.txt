*** saving-data-structures-in-java ***

 Please give me some advice regarding data saving in Java.  
 I’m new in Java. Previously I wrote programs on C++.  
 It was easy to save data in C++: just declare structure, fill its fields and then save it like byte array. As far as Java doesn’t have structures I suppose that Java programming means another save concept.  
 I will appreciate you for ideas and ideas what to read regarding this. 
 
 It's simpler in Java. 
 Use a   in place of your C++  , and  implement   . Your IDE will help you build any methods that you need to implement. Conceptually Java uses  reflection  to capture the values of the fields (aside from ones you've marked  ) in your class, so, by and large, the process is automated. 
 
 I am guessing, by 'saving' you mean saving to a disc.
If that is the case, you should be looking at the concept of serialization in Java. 
 Make your class implement the Serializable interface.
Then take cue from the following code to serialize. 
 
 Code on similar lines to deserialize. 
 
 In java instead of structure create a class corresponding to your storage criteria then create object for that class and then you can store the required datas in that object then store that object in array or any collections. 
 **for eg**
 create Student class which has name,regno etc.. then create object of student class store the datas in that object,so you can have your data in an object which is similar to structure then you can save students object in array or collections.
