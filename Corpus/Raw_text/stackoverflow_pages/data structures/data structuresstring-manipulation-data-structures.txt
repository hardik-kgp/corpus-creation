 What is the best data structure for string manipulation in Java?
By manipulation, I mean re-ordering characters of a string. 
 I'm thinking of splitting a string into a char array and manipulating it like that, but I want to know if there is a better way. 
 
 Thank you. 
 
 Use  . This will allow you to add and remove elements at any place of an array. Because of boxing, you will be able to use   type most of the time.
