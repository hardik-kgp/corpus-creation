*** symmetry-and-asymmetry-of-linear-data-structures ***

 What does it mean to discuss symmetry and asymmetry of data structures? Particularly stacks, queues, deques and priority queues. My textbook doesn't talk about it at all and I've found mixed answers on Google. I'm just confused as to what symmetry of a structure is and I was wondering if anyone had any clear answer for me to work off of. Thanks! 
 
 Double ended queues (deques) are symmetric, meaning whatever you can do to one end of the linear structure you can do to the other.   Stacks, queues and priority queues are asymmetric because you  are limited to what operations you can perform on the structure depending on if your are at the top, bottom, front or back of them.
