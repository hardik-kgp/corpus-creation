*** what-are-panda-esque-data-structures-to-store-in-dataframes ***

 I've heard that pandas doesn't 'deal well' with storing lists or dictionaries in individual cells, however I'm struggling to find more information on  why  this is the case. In many use cases it would be very useful for me to store more complex data structures in a Pandas cell - like a dictionary - how would I do this in a 'panda-esque' manner? Does this apply to all mutable data structures?  
 
 This probably isn't what you're looking for because @EdChum is right.  Very simply, there are very few good reasons to place non-scalar objects into   and   cells.   
 Consider the dataframe  
 
 
 You're better off, using embedded dictionaries. 
 
 
 However, if you want to manipulate them row or column-wise, you could write a subclass of   where you define addition 
 
 Then you could convert values to this new class and... 
 
 or 
 
 Or even get a numpy object array 
 
 
 That's kinda fun!  Not sure how "Pandas-esque" that is, but I like it.
