 I came across the term the term "main memory" data structures. For example  here  and  here  and  here  and  here . Googling did not give me a definite answer what that actually means. I got some reference that it means the data structures that are used to store in the persistent memory i.e. hard disk. If so, then as I have read binary trees are used store data on hard disks. If so, then std::map which uses binary tree will be one candidate for main memory data structure. What are other examples? 
 
 First your understanding of "main memory" is wrong, main memory is used to refer to the system RAM, a hard drive is secondary storage. And then there are specialized on-chip caches that a program generally has little or no control over. 
 That being said, all of the STL containers are limited to being memory hosted, but depending on the OS this  can include having parts swapped out of main memory to disk as part of virtual memory, however that, too, a program has little or no control over. And such disk backing lasts only so long as the program is active, it is not persisted after termination. 
 And while b-trees are a good candidate for being persisted to disk backed storage a usual binary tree is not. In this context b-tree and binary tree are not the same thing.
