*** which-way-is-more-efficient-to-learn-data-structures ***

 My programming knowledge is up to OOP since that was the last thing we covered in the university. However, I am taking 2 courses this summer and I am constantly under pressure, but I am planning to learn data structures along the way too, to be prepared for it next semester. 
 I had two plans to learn it but I am not sure which one will be more efficient: 
 -The first one is to skim through and learn about all the types of data structures and how they are implemented. 
 -The second one is to try instead of just reading and knowing about a data structure, I will go and try to implement it. However, the drawbacks are that its slow and time consuming, so I might not be able to learn all of the data structures in time 
 
 
 
 Practice using the data structures in your code. 
 Code those data structures from scratch. 
 Repeat steps 1 and 2. 
 
 
 There is really no shortcut for that.
