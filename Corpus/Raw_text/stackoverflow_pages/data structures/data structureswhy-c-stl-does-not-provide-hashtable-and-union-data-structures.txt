*** why-c-stl-does-not-provide-hashtable-and-union-data-structures ***

 At various places, I've read that STL does not provide hashtable and union data structures. How could these be implemented using other existing STL data structures? 
 
 Try the  std::tr1::unordered_map  for your hash map.  std::map is ordered, so it's not really as efficient as hash.  Not sure what you mean by a union data structure, but you can have unioned structs in C++ 
 **EDIT:**
 Additionally there are many other implementations of hash maps that some have done.  Boost has an  unordered map , Prasoon mentioned one in the question comments, and Google has  sparsehash . 
 
 Try std::map for your hash table needs...
