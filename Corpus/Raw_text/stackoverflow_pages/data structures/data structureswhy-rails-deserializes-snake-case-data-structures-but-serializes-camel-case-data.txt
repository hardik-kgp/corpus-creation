*** why-rails-deserializes-snake-case-data-structures-but-serializes-camel-case-data ***

 It is one of my first Ruby on Rails project and it is weird for me to send JSON with properties written in snake case on my requests and receive JSON with properties written in camel case on my responses. 
 Here is an example of request payload:
 
 
 And here is an example of response payload:
 
 
 Here is the code that consumes and returns the alike data structures above:
def create
 
 
 
 Use   method from  (which comes with Rails) like so: 
 
 Now, you can convert it to JSON string: 
 
 **UPDATE**
: You can override   method in your model class(since you're not clear with what exactly   is in your code, I assume you'd need to put this in the class whose object you're instantiating to send the data as JSON) like so - 
 
 Now, you can do:   and it'll convert attributes to camecase except the first character, i.e.:  .
