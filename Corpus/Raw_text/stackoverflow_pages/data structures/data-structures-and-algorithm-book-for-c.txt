 What is a popular/good data structures and algorithm analysis book for C other than
Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Principles in C by Thomas Standish. 
 
 Introduction to Algorithms  by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein is considered the standard reading on this subject. It's very thorough. 
 
 Algorithms in C  (Sedgewick) is also good  
 The Algorithm Design Manual  is very readable
