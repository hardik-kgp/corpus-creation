 Where can I find e-books on Data Structures and Algorithms? I am currently reading "Computer Algorithms: Introduction to design and Analysis" by Sara Baase and Allen Van Gelder. I would like to have additional information to supplement what's in this book. Also some references on worst-case analysis would be great.  
 
 By far my favourite algorithm textbook is  The Algorithm Design Manual , by Steven Skiena. Very easy to read, very practical, and extremely useful. The first half of the book is a general treatment of algorithm theory, with lots of practical examples. The second half is a huge library of common problems, what algorithms can be used to tackle them, and comprehensive lists of references. You won't be disappointed. 
 
 I like  Robert Sedgewick's  Algorithms books. The original one used Pascal and is nice because it does not get boggled down in language issues. 
 
 Introduction to Algorithms 
 The Art of Computer Programming  - by Donald Knuth (hard read, but well worth it, not recommended for a first algorithms book) 
 Concrete Mathemetics  - By Donald Knuth (understanding the math behind algorithms) 
 I don't know if e-book versions are available for these, but if they are...these books will definitely give you the theory behind worst-case, and asymptotic analysis of algorithms. 
 
 Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman - Design And Analysis Of Computer Algorithms 
A classic. 
 
 The  Algorithmist  wiki is a decent resource.

 **Introduction to Algorithms**
 by CLRS (second edition)  is pretty much the standard textbook today for these subjects. 
 
 I'm not sure if this counts as an "e-book", but I am rather fond of the wikibooks project. It is a bit disorganized, but has everything you need. Plus, built-in links to wikipedia!
