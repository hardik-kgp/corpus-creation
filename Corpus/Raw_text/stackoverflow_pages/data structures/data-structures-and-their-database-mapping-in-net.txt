*** data-structures-and-their-database-mapping-in-net ***

 From what I know, complex data structures (tree, binary tree, graph) are not available in the .Net Framework Base Class Library. Is there a good 3rd party library available for this purpose? 
 Further, I need to map these data structures back to a physical database (SQL Server). Is such an extension available? I'd love to have a tool to generate a script for database against the data structure I create (say a graph). 
 Needless to say, my data structures will shrink & grow. This should be reflected back in the database (therefore DMLs will be part of data structures to database mapping)) 
 
 Can you define "complex data structures"?  I've never found something that could be represented in SQL that couldn't be represented in .NET. 
 It sounds like you're just looking for an ORM for some forms over data.  Take a look at  NHibernate  or  Entity Framework .  They essentially help you create a mapping graph between business objects and data persistence.
