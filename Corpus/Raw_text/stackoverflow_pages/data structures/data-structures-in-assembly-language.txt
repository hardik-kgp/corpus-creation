*** data-structures-in-assembly-language ***

 recently i've downloaded a guide of the assembly language, that teach you reversing and something other, from the site  Crackmes 
 i'm doing the "lessons" but i can't understand how data structures work.
so for exemple:
1) what's the instruction: mov large fs:0, eax
2) what's the SEH and why it's used to create a data structure
3) how is the input stored in the data structure? 
 can you explain me what does it occur, please? 
 thanks all 
 
 "SEH" == Structured Exception Handler.   This is a Microsoft Windows feature to support programs (including assembler programs) pass exceptions in a standard way.  The  
 
 if I recall correctly, is about setting up the Structured Exception Handler. If you want
to know more about this, go to Microsoft's MSDN site and learn about it. 
 While useful, none of the SEH stuff is really about data structures. 
 If you want to learn about data structures in general, "reversing" (reverse engineering) isn't the way to do it.   If that's not what you mean, you'll only get confusing answers to your somewhat confusing question. 
 In particular, I wouldn't spend a lot of energy trying to learn from a site that appears to be dedicated to cracking code.
