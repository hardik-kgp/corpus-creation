 Good STL-like library for C 
 Are there any open source C libraries with common data structures?   
 
 Is there a "standard" library that C programmers use for frequently-used data structures (hash/tree-based sets/maps, heaps, etc.)? Or is there no single, well-known implementation? 
(Something kind of like Boost for C++?) 
 
 See GLib or APR (Apache Portable Runtime) library, they are the most well-known C libraries for data structures.
