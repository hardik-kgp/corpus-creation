*** data-structures-in-orms ***

 How do you map rudimentary data structures (e.g. Tree, Dictionary) in an ORM such as NHibernate. 
 
 O/R mapping is about mapping classes to tables/views so the data inside instances of both (object and table/view row) mean the same thing.  
 Mapping trees/dictionaries therefore doesn't make any sense, as it's not about that. If your entity is represented in code by a dictionary, THEN it makes sense, however that will never happen.
