 I'm planning to take DataStructures course this semester. I had gone through the internet for material related to Data Strucutures. I would like to have an idea on the concepts of data structures before my semester begins. Can anyone suggest me any material or book ? 
 
 There are several books which will offer you a great deal of learning . To Name a few, 
 1. Data structures and algorithms made easy  - A very good read from an Indian author 
 2. Data structures and algorthims  by Alfred Aho and Ulman 
 3. Fundamental of Data structures  by Horowitz and Sahni 
 to name a few on learning elementary data structures. Apart from that there are other books which are very good for algorithms. But these books should be enough to give you an introduction.
