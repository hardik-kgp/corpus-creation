 Is it possible to implement data structures using java? If yes can u help me 
 
 Java class is a data structure + supporting methods to access/modify the state and variables. 
 You should learn Java Object Oriented approach. 
 Also make sure you work through the  Java Collections framework  as all the most commonly used datastructures are already implemented for you. 
 
 Ohhhh boy... if you're asking this, I think you need to read up on what a data structure is. 
 Java has classes (data structure), enums (data structure), arrays (data structure), arraylist (data structure), queue (data structure), stack (data structure), linked list (data structure)...................... even javascript has data structure.. 
 You can see here on what types of data structures are commonly used within this language
