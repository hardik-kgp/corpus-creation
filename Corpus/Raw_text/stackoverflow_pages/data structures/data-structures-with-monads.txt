*** data-structures-with-monads ***

 
 I'm having some trouble creating data structures with monads. In particular, the data structure contains a random vector and some other fields which are not random. Using   works when the whole type is a monad but not when just some part of the data structure is a monad.  
 I get the feeling that I should use   or something of the sort, but they give different errors. I also have some trouble converting a random vector to string in order to print it to screen. I'm unsure of the difference between   and  , and which one I should use. The latter seem to work but all examples online seem to use   instead.
Furthermore. general code review is also appreciated.  
 
 
 
 
 
 The problem is that   isn't  . Therefore you cannot use  . 
 However, it doesn't really make sense to put the   inside  . It's possible, but not really handy. We could fix your code if we've used 
 
 But that's still not easy to use. Instead, let us simplify  : 
 
 Now let's rewrite  , so that it returns  : 
 
 And everything is fine. This also makes it possible to use your   in functions that don't know that you operate in a  , e.g.
