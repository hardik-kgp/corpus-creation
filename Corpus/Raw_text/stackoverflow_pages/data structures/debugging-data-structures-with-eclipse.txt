*** debugging-data-structures-with-eclipse ***

 I wonder if there is a plugin or a recommended way for eclipse to see only interesting contents of common data structures when debugging. For example when debugging a string, I would like to see just the string value not the entire data structure, similarly when debugging a vector array I am interested in to see just the members and size, not the underlying complicated members. 
 
 You can put some expressions in the  expression view  of Eclipse and show only what you need .
