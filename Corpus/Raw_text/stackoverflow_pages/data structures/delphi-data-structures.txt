*** delphi-data-structures ***

 I maybe need to do a project in Delphi and are a beginner in that field. Currently, I am searching the net for ressources and get confused because there are so few resource sites. 
 First of: can you give me some good websites with resources for Delphi I missed so far? 
 I was also searching for data structures in Delphi and was wondering if there are cool classes like an ArrayList in Java or something like that? 
 
 exist many resources for a  Delphi beginner, see theses questions in StackOverflow  
 
 Where can I find good beginner-level Delphi tutorials online? 
 Delphi = Pascal? Resources for Learning? 
 Learning Delphi 
 Delphi resources for existing .NET developer. 
 Whatâ€™s the best Delphi book for a newbie? 
 
 A good book about data structures in Delphi is 
 **tomes of delphi: algorithms and data structures**
  
 
 (source:  boyet.com )   
 I think wich the ArrayList Class in Java is very similar to the Generics list (  TList< T>  )  introduced in delphi 2009. you can check also the  TList  Class in delphi. 
 Bye. 
 
 I think  DelphiFeeds  is a good starting point. There are links to many other Delphi websites including  TorryNet  where you can find many open source components. 
 As for structures look at TStrings/TStringList and TList. I use them very often. 
 For other classes and functions look at  Delphi Basics . There are descriptions and code examples. 
 
 Check out  Project Jedi  and the  JEDI CODE LIBRARY. 
 
 The JEDI Code Library (JCL) consists
  of a set of thoroughly tested and
  fully documented utility functions and
  non-visual classes which can be
  instantly reused in your Delphi and
  C++ Builder projects. 
 
 
 Another good resource for components is  delphipages.com .  If you have any questions the best place to get answers is here on stack overflow. :) 
 For specific cool collections, two units that you will want to open and dig through are contnrs and generics.collections.  Both are in the delphi source directory (..\RAD Studio\x.x\source\Win32\rtl\common) which is installed for licensed versions.   
 
 The   is similar to an ArrayList. 
I learnt a lot from  delphi.about.com  and  codegearguru 
 
 If you are using Delphi 2009 or 2010, it comes with several useful data structures where you don't really need to do anything special (TList, TDictionary...). 
 
 The Delphi Help is online. I don't know what you have missed but did you see  Getting Started with Rad Studio ? 
 For data-structures I suggest first to take a look at the  Contnrs.pas unit  in the VCL. It is located under source\Win32\rtl\common. And if you are lucky and have at least Delphi 2009 then there is also a generics variant in  Generics.Collections.pas 
 
 My favorite Delphi sites is unordered: 
 
 About Delphi 
 Delphi Basics 
 Delphi Wiki 
 
 And of course this site  Stackoverflow 
 
 if you're french (or understand french) there is the  Delphi section of Developpez.com
