 I know this  **wiki link**
 exists which has different data structures.  
 I want to know if there is a place where I can get the complexities (for insert, delete, update etc.) in a neat table format (for reference). 
 
 The page that you linked to in your question has a list of many data structures. Each of them a page that details the specific data structures. I know you want the table of comparisons in a ready made format but since it does not appear to exist then it might be something that you can put together easily by browsing through the various pages. For instance the comparison of the various algorithms in the array is given  here , and for the b-tree  here . So it may require some work to compile it all into a simple reference. Hmmm...maybe there is a blog post in the making. 
 
 Here it is on Wikipedia:  Worst-case analysis of data structures
