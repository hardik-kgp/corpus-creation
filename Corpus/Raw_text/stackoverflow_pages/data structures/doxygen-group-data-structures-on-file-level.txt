*** doxygen-group-data-structures-on-file-level ***

 I would like to use the  Doxygen grouping mechanism  for data structures. I'm already using it for functions and it works well so far. What I've experienced so far fits to the documentation regarding member groups of a single type (e.g. function only) or mixed type (e.g. typedefs and functions). 
 Now I tried to extend these member groups with data structures, and this fails exceptionally. Data structures are always a top section on its own. My tries so far: 
 
 Put a data structures definition inside an existing mixed type member group. -> Data structure is still documented in a separate top level section. 
 
 
 Side by Side of final Doxygen output and desired Doxygen output (Photoshopped) 
 
 
 Creating a group solely consisting of data structures. -> Data structures are documented in a separate top level section and the documentation block for this group vanishes completely. 
 
 
 Side by Side of final Doxygen output and desired Doxygen output (Photoshopped) 
 
 
 Use a module and add the data structures mit \ingroup. -> Data structure pops up in the module, but the file documentation still looks the same as above 
 Using \nosubgrouping command on file level documentation. -> No changes at all to file documentation page. 
 
 
 I would like that the documentation for file  /  displays data structures in the group they were defined in. 
 The programming language is C, but I'm very limited in terms of changing the code to fit documentation needs. Doxygen version is 1.8.16. The configuration file is almost default. (I left out stuff like project name and input settings) 
 
 Any help appreciated.
