*** duplicating-a-mysql-table-indices-and-data ***

 How do I copy or clone or duplicate the data, structure,
and indices of a MySQL table to a new one? 
 This is what I've found so far. 
 This will copy the data and the structure,
but not the indices: 
 
 This will copy the structure and indices,
but not the data: 
 
 
 To copy with indexes and triggers do these 2 queries: 
 
 To copy just structure and data use this one: 
 
 I've asked this before: 
 Copy a MySQL table including indexes 
 
 Apart from the solution above, you can use   to make it in one line. 
 
 
 MySQL way: 
 
 
 Go to  **phpMyAdmin**
 and select your original table then select " **Operations**
" tab in the " **Copy table to (database.table)**
" area.  Select the database where you want to copy and add a name for your new table. 
 
 
 I found the same situation and the approach which I took was as follows: 
 
 Execute   : This will give you the   syntax for the table which you want to clone 
 Run the   query by changing the table name to clone the table. 
 
 This will create exact replica of the table which you want to clone along with indexes. The only thing which you then need is to rename the indexes (if required). 
 
 After I tried the solution above, I come up with my own way. 
 My solution a little manual and needs DBMS. 
 First, export the data. 
 Second, open the export data. 
 Third, replace old table name with new table name. 
 Fourth, change all the trigger name in the data (I use MySQL and it show error when I don't change trigger name). 
 Fifth, import your edited SQL data to the database.  
 
 The better way to duplicate a table is using only   statement. In this way, independently from the number of records in the table, you can perform the duplication instantly. 
 My purpose is: 
 
 This avoids the   statement that, in case of table with a lot of records can take time to be executed. 
 I suggest also to create a PLSQL procedure as the following example: 
 
 Have a nice day!

 Expanding on  this answer  one could use a stored procedure: 
 
 Which will result in a duplicate table called   If called when 
 
 results: 
 
 
 **Implementation**

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Try this : 
 
 I selected 4 columns from old-table and made a new table. 
 
 FOR MySQL 
 
 FOR MSSQL
Use  : 
 
 This SQL is used for copying tables, here the contents of oldCustomersTable will be copied to  . 
Make sure the    does not  exist in the database.
