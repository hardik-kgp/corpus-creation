*** erlang-data-structures ***

 I'm a bit confused about what data structure I can use to be able to do following tasks rather fast: 
 
 Save tuples (can be changed to contain a keyword). Will be something like {UserInfo, Time, TimeLvl} 
 Remove element knowing the tuple (or the keyword) 
 Update all contained elements, changing one of the tuple's elements about once a second (TimeLvl will get higher the longer the user waits). 
 
 The Contained data will change a lot as users come and go. 
 What would be the best data-structure for this use case? 
 
 Take a look at this article:  Key-Value stores . 
 Than decide which of the data structures presented is best suited for you. 
The article also provides a benchmark. 
 I personally like  gb_trees , which is quite fast and easy to use. 
 
 Take a look at  gproc 
 It should do what you want, it is very efficient, and made by one of the creator of Erlang, so robust enough. 
 You can check some gproc capabilities  here , then you will know if it fits your problem 
 EDIT 1 : 
After further search, updating the Value of a gproc entry can be done with  
 EDIT 2 :
So you will use :
