 I have knownledge of following data structures and I'm looking for example usage of them in real-world applicatons; 
 
 Binary Search Trees 
 Red-Black Trees 
 Interval Trees(Augmented RBT) 
 Hash Tables 
 
 
 **1. Binary Search Trees**

 BST is used very widely for information organizing, indexing and retrieving.  **Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer of Microsoft**
 are the most well-known app which uses BST. 
 **2. Red-Black Trees**
 (we'd like to call it "AVL trees")
  RBT is just a specific kind of BST. With an RBT, we can quickly locate data structures corresponding to a specific value.  **Linux Kernel**
 links together all the memory area objects in a RBT while managing vm_area_struct. 
 **3. Augmented RBT**

 Augmented RBT works very much like a normal RBT, with the exception that it keeps additional information in each node.  **Linux Kernel**
 introduced Augmented RBT to improve the function of the page attribute table (PAT) support for the x86 architecture. 
 **4. Hash Table**

 Hash is used extremely widely. For example the famous  **MD5 hash algorithm**
,  **P2P transport**
 etc.
