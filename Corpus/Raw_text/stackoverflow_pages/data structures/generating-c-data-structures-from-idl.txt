*** generating-c-data-structures-from-idl ***

 I am working to create a framework in "C" language where all data structures (both standard and custom one) used in a program are auto generated from a "IDL" or "XML" file rather than hardcoded by the user.  
 I want to autogenerate dump functions for these data structures rather than add printf functions for each every variable whenever it is added. This is similar to CORBA functionality and I am no expert in it. 
 Is there any library or simplified implementation available for reference ?
