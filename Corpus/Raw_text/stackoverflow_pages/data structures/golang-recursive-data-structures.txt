*** golang-recursive-data-structures ***

 I have a simple question... I'm trying to reproduce this recursive data structure in Golang with slices. 
 
 Right now I have some 'rough' source code using the recursive data structure below with slices and everything works fine except my typed structure is a structure and not a slice of structures. Ideally I would like my typed recursive data structure to be a slice of Trie's which has elements Trie{byte, []Trie}. Hope that makes sense? Right now I have a type which is a Trie struct{byte, []Trie}.  
 
 Maybe this will help. When I create my Trie of slices right now I use this function. 
 
 I would like to have the Trie of slices defined in such a way that I could create the slices like this. 
 
 Is this possible with slices or do I have use my first(only) solution for slices? 
 
 Is this  what you're looking for? 
 
 TLDR: I think it is possible 
 Using your Trie struct 
 
 Here is a modified   constructor. I wasn't sure if you wanted to show a chain of  s so I figured to pass   just as an example.
