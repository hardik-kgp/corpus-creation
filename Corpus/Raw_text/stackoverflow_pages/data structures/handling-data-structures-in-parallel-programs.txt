*** handling-data-structures-in-parallel-programs ***

 I don't have much experience in writing multi threaded applications so I was wondering if this  is a good way to handle data structures assuming the data structure itself is immutable.
Maybe you could suggest alternatives? 
 
 
 What you're trying to achieve is already implemented in Akka Agents:  http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.3/scala/agents.html 
 The Akka solution has the added advantage that it doesn't use any blocking operations, such as  , which reduce the potential concurrency of your code and can slow it down - as per  Amdahl's law 
 **update from comment**

 It  is  possible to queue and serialise operations without blocking. 
 "Blocking" specifically refers to any code that makes a Java thread enter  either of the   or   states .  The techniques for doing this belong to a family known as  non-blocking algorithms . 
 
 Arguably... One of the main benefits in using advanced/specialised libraries such as Akka is that the authors can focus on such logic and keep up with the relevant papers - so you don't have to!
