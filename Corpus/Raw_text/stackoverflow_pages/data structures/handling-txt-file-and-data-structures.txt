*** handling-txt-file-and-data-structures ***

 I found this exercise where i had to create a data structures, read some inputs, store the inputs on the "appropriate" data structure and then print them on a txt file. I managed to create the program but i'm not really sure i did it properly, since i'm new to data structures, is it storing every input in the data structure before printing it? 
 Last question: i was looking forward to adding a function to order the hotel list according to the stars number, so if an hotel has 5 stars, it will be at the top of the list. Is it possible to do that? Can i do that with arrays?
