*** how-to-get-infinite-data-structures ***

 There are some algorithms which need "infinite Data-Structures" like an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells. How is such a problem tackeld? Are they maybe using "pseudo-infinite" structures where just a large amount of data is used? Or is there somehow a "resize" implemented, when capacity is not enough? 
 I am using a Cellular-Automata Algorithm, which is beeing computed on a 2000 x 2000 grid, but i would like to have the grid infinitely.  
 
 By using  lazy evaluation . 
 Delaying the calculation (or creation) of each item in an infinite data structure until it is needed eliminates the problem of having to create an infinite data set.
