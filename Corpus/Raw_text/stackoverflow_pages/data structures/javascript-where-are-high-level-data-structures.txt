*** javascript-where-are-high-level-data-structures ***

 I'm writing a client program for a game in Javascript but I'm new in Javascript world. Core Javascript lack of high level data structures. 
 I've found code snippets on internet but I'm looking for a reference library (like commons-collection or google-collection in java world). 
 I found this post:  JavaScript implementation of a set data structure  which refers to jshashtable and closure. 
 Are they reference implementations? Do you know something else? 
 Thanks
