*** list-data-structures-in-javascript ***

 In  an exercise  in the book  Eloquent JavaScript  I need to create a list data structure (as below) based on the array [1, 2, 3].  
 The tutorial  JavaScript Data Structures - The Linked List   shows how to do this, but I don't really understand the intention to create   and   variables inside the tutorial. 
 
 I tried to solve this via the code below. 
 
 This code gives me an infinite loop of array[0]. What's wrong with my code? 
 
 
 This  tutorial  shows how to do this but I don't really understand the intention to create   and   variables inside the tutorial. 
 
 The tutorial uses a   wrapper around that recursive structure with some helper methods. It says: " It is possible to avoid having to record the   of the list by performing a traverse of the entire list each time you need to access the end - but in most cases storing a reference to the end of the list is more economical. " 
 
 This code gives me an infinite loop of array[0]. 
 
 Not really, but it creates a circular reference with the line  . Probably the code that is outputting your list chokes on that. 
 
 What's wrong is with my code? 
 
 You need to create multiple objects, define the object literal inside the loop body instead of assigning to the very same object over and over! Also, you should access   inside the loop instead of   only: 
 
 
 This particular data structure is more commonly called  cons .  Recursion  is the most natural (not necessarily the most efficient) way to work with conses. First, let's define some helper functions (using LISP notation rather than "value/rest"): 
 
 Now, to build a cons from an array, use the following recursive statement: 
 
 In Javascript: 
 
 And the reverse function is similarly trivial:
