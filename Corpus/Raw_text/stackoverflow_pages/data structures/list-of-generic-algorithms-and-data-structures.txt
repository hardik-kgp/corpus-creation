                            It's difficult to tell what is being asked here. This question is ambiguous, vague, incomplete, overly broad, or rhetorical and   cannot be reasonably answered in its current form.

 As part of a library project, I want to include a plethora of generic algorithms and data structures. This includes algorithms for searching and sorting, data structures like linked lists and binary trees, path-finding algorithms like A*... the works. 
 Basically, any generic algorithm or data structure you can think of that you think might be useful in such a library, please post or add it to the list. Thanks! (NOTE: Because there is no single right answer I've of course placed this in community wiki... and also, please don't suggest algorithms which are too specialized to be provided by a generic library) 
 The List: 
 
 Data structures

 
 AVL tree 
 B-tree

 
 B*-tree 
 B+-tree 
 
 Binary tree

 
 Binary heap 
 Binary search tree 
 
 Linked lists

 
 Singly linked list 
 Doubly linked list 
 
 Stack 
 Queue 
 
 Sorting algorithms

 
 Binary tree sort 
 Bubble sort 
 Heapsort 
 Insertion sort 
 Merge sort 
 Quicksort 
 Selection sort 
 
 Searching algorithms

 There's already a resource for this sort of material. I'm voting to close as not a real question.
