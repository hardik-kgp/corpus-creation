*** list-of-linear-and-non-linear-data-structures ***

 I know the concept of linearity in data structures. But I want to know that what  **Data Structures**
 are  **Linear**
 and what are  **Non-Linear**
. Please show me the list of both types of data structures that we use commonly.    
 
 Here is an explanation that also gives some  examples  for both cases. 
 Linear: list, array 
 Non-Linear: tree, graph
