 Can someone point me to an easy to understand implementation of lock-free data structures (pseudo-code is fine) that only use low-level atomic instructions like test&set and compare&swap. I'm trying to learn how they work, but everything I've seen is way more complex than what I want. I'm specifically looking for linked lists, queues, and stacks. 
 It'll be awesome if I can get a C implementation.
