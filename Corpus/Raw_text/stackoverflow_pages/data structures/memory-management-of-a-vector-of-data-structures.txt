*** memory-management-of-a-vector-of-data-structures ***

 I have a data-structure which looks like 
 
 I create a vector of data-structures  
 
 My doubt is if I do this 
 
 can I reclaim the memory? 
 
 You can do better than that: 
 
 All you need to do is: 
 
 This is because you create a temporary which is empty. Then swap the empty content with actual data of  . The temporary is then destroyed and reclaiming the memory that was allocated with your variable (because the memory was swapped into the temporary). 
 This is called the  **"Shrink to Fit Idiom"**
