*** mixing-data-structures-and-objects ***

 Uncle Bob says not to mix objects and data structures. I have the following data structure... 
 
 I would like to add a function called .hasAllCreditCardInfo() onto that data structure. But is that a bad idea? Is that turning my data structure into an object?
