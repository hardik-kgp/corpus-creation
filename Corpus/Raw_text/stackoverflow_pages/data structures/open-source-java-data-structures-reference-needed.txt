 The link  http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html  describes several interesting data structures like concurrent skip-list. Is there any known reliable open source representation of these? 
 
 You can have a look at the   package  upon which those classes are based (although this library is in maintenance mode only now). 
 Of course, you can also have a look at the  OpenJDK source  for a more recent version.
