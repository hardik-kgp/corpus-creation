*** passing-data-structures-from-java-to-perl ***

 I would like to pass some data structures from java to perl. 
 In perl, this should basically be a hash where the keys are strings and each value is either a string, a hash or a hash of hashes. 
 Is there a way to dump data from java that can be easily parsed by perl? 
 
 JSON and YAML are serialization standards that have both Java and Perl implementations.
