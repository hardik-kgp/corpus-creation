*** passing-data-structures ***

 Background information for my question: 
 
 I have a basic TCP/IP a server-client in c++ language, 
 I create a lot of structures (for different packages) like this; 
 
 I am trying to pass data into structures on server side; 
 
 Pop functions like this; 
 
 
 I can't pass the data into structures, anyone have idea for this?  
 
 You should write your struct into a byte array and then send the byte array. You should never write a struct in a binary way, neither to a file nor to a socket.
On the other side you read the byte array and then read back the values into your structure.  
 Here's some sample code how I do it. Endianess and padding are no problem with this approach. It gives you also better performance to do so than to write every single value to the socket.
I'm using this to send UDP datagrams, but it could also be used to send it over TCP.  
 You need some functions like the following ones. 
 
 EDIT:
I've found the post which was guiding me to the right path some time ago.
Here it is with some more explanations:
