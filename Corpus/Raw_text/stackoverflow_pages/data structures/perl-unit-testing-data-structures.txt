*** perl-unit-testing-data-structures ***

 I'm looking for something like is_deeply or Test::Deep's cmp_deeply, but that just checks the keys/types of a data structure, not the values. For example, I care that a key is an array ref of scalars, but not what the values are. 
 Anyone have any ideas? I'm sure I am not the first one who has had to make sense of varying data structures. I want to test to make sure the "signature" of the data structure is intact, but I care less about the data in it or matching stuff with regex etc. 
 
 You can write your own test functions fairly easily, using the functions provided in  Test::Builder  and  Test::More . 
 I have written the test assuming you mean an arrayref of  non-references , since the only thing you can store in an array is a scalar.  You may want to make adjustments. 
 
 
 Plain  Test::More    method works on references:
