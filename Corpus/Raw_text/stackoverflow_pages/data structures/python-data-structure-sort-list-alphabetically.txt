*** python-data-structure-sort-list-alphabetically ***

 I am a bit confused regarding data structure in python;  , , and  . I am trying to sort out a simple list, probably since I cannot identify the type of data I am failing to sort it. 
 My list is simple:    
 My question is what type of data this is, and how to sort the words alphabetically? 
 
  denotes a  list ,   denotes a  tuple  and   denotes a  dictionary . You should take a look at the  official Python tutorial  as these are the very basics of programming in Python. 
 What you have is a list of strings. You can sort it like this: 
 
 As you can see, words that start with an uppercase letter get preference over those starting with a lowercase letter. If you want to sort them independently, do this: 
 
 You can also sort the list in reverse order by doing this: 
 
 **Please note:**
 If you work with Python 3, then   is the correct data type for every string that contains human-readable text. However, if you still need to work with Python 2, then you might deal with unicode strings which have the data type   in Python 2, and not  . In such a case, if you have a list of unicode strings, you must write   instead of  . 
 
 Python has a built-in function called  , which will give you a sorted list from any iterable you feed it (such as a list ( ); a dict ( , although it will just return a sorted list of the keys; a set ( ); or a tuple ( )). 
 
 Lists also have a   method that will perform the sort in-place (x.sort() returns None but changes the x object) . 
 
 Both also take a   argument, which should be a callable (function/lambda) you can use to change what to sort by. 
For example, to get a list of  -pairs from a dict which is sorted by value you can use the following code: 
 
 
 You can use built-in   function. 
 
 
 You're dealing with a python list, and sorting it is as easy as doing this. 
 
 
  will sort it alphabetically. You can add   in the brackets to reverse the order of items:
