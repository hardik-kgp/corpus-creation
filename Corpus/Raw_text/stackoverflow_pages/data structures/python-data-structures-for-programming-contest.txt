*** python-data-structures-for-programming-contest ***

 What are the equivalent data structures in Python of those in C++? As a contestant I have always used C++ STL in programming contests. So, vector,set,map,queue,priority queue,pair all of these came in handy. Recently, I tried to solve a few problems using python. But could not find same structures. So, what are the similar data structures in Python? If not available, what are the tricks to implement those? 
 
 List, set and map (called dictionary), are built-in in python. For others see the   module (especially the   is suitable for queues)
