*** python-dynamic-data-structures ***

 I am going to read the lines of a given text file and select several chunks of data whose format are (int, int\n) . Every time the number of lines are different so I need a dynamic sized data structure in Python. I also would like to store those chunks in 2D data structures. If you are familiar with MATLAB programming, I'd like to have something like a structure A{n} n = number of chunks of data and each chunk includes several lines of the data mentioned above.
Which type of data structure would you recommend? and how to implement with it?
i.e. A{0} = ([1,2],[2,3],[3,4]) A{1} = ([1,1],[2,2],[5,5],[7,4]) and so on.
Thank you 
 
 A python list can contain lists as well any different data type. 
 
 list.Append appends whatever it is given as argument to the list
while list.extend makes the given the argument the tail of the list. 
 I guess you required list would appear somehwhat like this:

 Just keep in mind that if your are reading data from text file , the format is string , you need to use int() to convert your string to int. 
 
 The issue was resolved with 2 steps appending the list.
