*** python-selection-sort-with-different-data-structures ***

 I have been staring at this problem for days and I am stuck. I know I need to use multiple stacks and multiple queues but I just can't figure out the implementation. Implement (in Python) the selection sort algorithm using array, linked-list, stack, and queue data structures. That is, the input to selection sort will be an array or a linked-list or a stack or a queue of numbers and access to the data in those structures is via functions typical of the data structures 
 This is my code:
