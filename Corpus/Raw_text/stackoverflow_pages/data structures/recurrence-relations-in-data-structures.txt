*** recurrence-relations-in-data-structures ***

 In my Data Structures Class, we're looking at recurrence relations like T(n) and big O problems O(n). I'd appreciate any resources for learning these, my textbook doesn't cover T(n), and the professor skips over lots of steps. 
 I haven't seen a good, step-by-step method for solving these things. I realize that every problem is unique, but there has to be some sort of framework for doing these. 
 Thanks. 
 
 Check  Concrete Mathematics - A Foundation for Computer Science , it's a brilliant book with lots of examples and exercises. 
 
 Another great book is  Introduction to Algorithms .  It has a pretty thorough section on solving recurrence relations. 
 You are right, there is a generalized method for solving simple recurrence relations called the  Master Theorem .  (The explanation in  Introduction to Algorithms  is much better than the Wikipedia page.)  It doesn't work for every case, but it solves a lot of common ones.
