*** redis-list-all-data-structures ***

 I'm absolutely a newbie using redis. 
 I need to: 
 
 list all databases 
 list all data structures 
 
 I've connected to redis 4.0.11 server using  . 
 
 Redis is a key value storage not a database, You can't query or structure the Redis like you do in a database. You can only receive the relevant value from the key that you are passing. 
 Usually instead of database a key value storage like redis is used to to high performance key value storage and retrieve, if performance of a database is not enough.
