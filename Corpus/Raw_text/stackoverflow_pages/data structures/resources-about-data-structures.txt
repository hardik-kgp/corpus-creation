 Do you know any useful resource, book, article, webpage about data structures? 
 I found very useful wikibooks page:

 What helps you with data structure design? 
 
 The ultimate collection on data-structures, their implementation and mathematical reasoning is Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming series. Here's an  amazon  link. 
 
 AV Aho, JE Hopcroft, JD Ullman (1983) Data structures and algorithms.  Addison-Wesley. 
 After Knuth, the classic.  And possible to read cover to cover.
