*** right-approach-to-learning-data-structures ***

 Maybe some of you will not find this question to be inappropriate in this forum but I sincerely need some guidance on this. I have been working on Algorithms and Data structures lately, for Algorithm I have been practicing problem solving on topcoder and codechef, which is helping me a lot in understanding algorithms. But most problems are focused on algorithm, and I still don't get a lot problems where I have to focus on which data structure to pick. So can anybody recommend some website or other tools that focus on developing right instincts for choosing Data structures and their implementation. 
 
 The first step is to implement the different data structures so you understand the operations they support. You should also make a table of them with the operations they support and their complexity. Take a book on algorithms and data structures and implement all the data structures in it and work through the problems. 
 Once you understand the data structures well, you'll gain much more from doing hard problems and looking at clever solutions. If you see a clever use of a data structure you know well, it'll typically be much more surprising to you and you'll remember the solution. 
 Another important point is that if you typically use a specific programming language, make sure you know what data structures are provided by its standard library and make sure you know what the standard (or documentation) says about their implementation (i.e. what complexity bounds different operations are guaranteed to have etc.).
