*** source-for-studying-data-structures ***

 Does anybody know a good source where to study data structures? In particular i am looking for trees and graphs. I've already tried geekforgeeks but i wonder if there is something else as good as it.  
 Thank's. 
 
 For algorithms on trees and graphs you can prefer "Thomas H. Cormen Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition, and for coding practice you can prefer InterviewBit or Leetcode(coding platforms) and apart from that, you must try geeksforgeeks
the link for book is
