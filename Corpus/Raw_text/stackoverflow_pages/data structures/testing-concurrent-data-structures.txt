*** testing-concurrent-data-structures ***

 How can you  practically  test a synchronized data structure (in C)? 
 Firing a couple of threads and have them compete for access to the structure for a while to see if anything goes wrong doesn't sound very safe. 
 EDIT in response to comments: I mean that there are several threads running functions that operate on the same set of data, with some kind of synchronization strategy (flags/semaphores/lock-free CAS/etc) to presumably eliminate race conditions and deadlocks. The problem is programatically testing for the correct synchronization of the workers. 
 
 **No-one**
 really knows how to do this with 100% reliability.   Here  is just one example of of a testing tool to find concurrency bugs.
