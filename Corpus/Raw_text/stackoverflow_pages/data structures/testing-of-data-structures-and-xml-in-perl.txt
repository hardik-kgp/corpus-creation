*** testing-of-data-structures-and-xml-in-perl ***

 I have a tool that: 
 **1.**
 Converts several data structures to XML.  I use XML::Element to convert from data structure to XML. 
 **2.**
 Converts XML to data structures. I use XML::TreeBuilder to convert XML to data structures. 
 I need to write unit tests for this tool. 
1. In order to test conversion of data structures to XML I perform testing of the XML using functions from Test::XML::XPath module.  For example -  **like_xpath**
 function. 
2. In order to test conversion of XML to data structures I use function  **cmp_deeply**
 from Test::Deep. 
 Is it correct approach of testing data structures and XML? 
Or I missed something? 
PS. 
It's my first experience of unit tests in perl. 
 
 Perhaps I'm being simple-minded, but this seems like a situation where it might be better to test the big picture rather than worrying about the details in between. Here's a schematic example:
