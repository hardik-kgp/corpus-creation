 Is there any library or documentation/link which gives more information of implementing Trie data structure in java? 
 Any help would be great! 
 Thanks. 
 
 You could read up on  Java Trie  or look at  trie . 
 
 There's a java implementation in  Robert Sedgewick's book on algorithms . It's very basic, i.e., no compression and a very simple interface, but I found it instructive to understand how tries work.  
 I also recently found a  library  that includes a memory efficient concurrent implementation of tries which looks very promising. It even includes a LCS solver using tries. 
 There is also the  Lucene implementation  that's used in production applications. 
 
 Another implementation, I believe from Limewire developers originally:  https://github.com/rkapsi/patricia-trie
