*** unordered-map-with-data-structures ***

 I am creating an unordered_map containing data structures. At each step i need to insert a new structure with a different key in the unordered_map. The new structure inserted is equal to another just inserted with the exception of same values. The problem is that if i create a structure A equal to another structure B just created and then i modified vectors in A, the changes are applied also to B.
I report the following simple example to better explain my problem. 
 
 In the code above i create a first structure with label=0,cost=0,vet=[1,2,3,4] and i insert it into the map. Then i copy the first structure in a second one and i modified the second structure such that label=1,cost=2,vet=[1,2,3,3]. The problem is that vet in the first structure is modified. Notice that label and cost are not modified. In fact the output is the following: 
 
 Why this happens?
Thank you 
 
 The reason the vet is modified in both is because you have a pointer to the array, you are not creating a new pointer for the copy so it is just copying the address over. 
 If you want the second copy to have its own version then you will need to write your copy constructor.
