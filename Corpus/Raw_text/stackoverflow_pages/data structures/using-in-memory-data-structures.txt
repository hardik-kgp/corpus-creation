*** using-in-memory-data-structures ***

 I have a client requirement of 
not to use an RDBMS, but instead do everything using in-memory data-structures   If the server is restarted then the application state will revert to the last state saved. 
 I don't have any idea of using in-memory data , I used to work with MySQL ,but not in memory
If anyone could please guide me a bit about this , any tutorial or something 
 Below are some examples ...

 Thanks  
 
 you can use  sqlite , which has hooks to a lot of languages. 
 the default use for sqlite is for file-based, but it can easily be used  in-memory .
