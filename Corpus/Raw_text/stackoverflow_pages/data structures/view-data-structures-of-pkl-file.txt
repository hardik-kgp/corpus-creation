 I try to view the data structures of ExtremeNet_250000.pkl( size about 780M) by the code: 
 
 but it return the int just like 
 
 could you give me some suggestion? 
 
 For your specific case: 
 Based on your file name, I'm guessing you're playing around with  the   demo project . Tracing through the code and dependencies, it looks like that cache file is the result of a   call from the   package. Simplest solution for this case is probably just to install  , and  use   to load it . 
 
 General solution: 
 It's possible to save multiple pickled objects in a file in an unstructured manner. That is, rather than saving a   as a   with a single: 
 
 the creator could dump the individual values one by one with: 
 
 removing the   structure from the output. 
 If you've got such a file, you have to read the values out in a similar way. The simplest approach is to make a generator function that will yield successive values when iterated, e.g.: 
 
 allowing you to iterate the contents of your file with: 
 
 or load the whole thing into a   (if sufficient memory available) with: 
 
 For a file that large, I'd recommend iterating live to preserve memory rather than converting to a   up front; if it's nothing but largish integers in the range of that first value, the memory cost to load the entire thing into a list would be roughly three times the disk size, depending on pickle protocol, whether your interpreter is 32 or 64 bit, etc. Regardless, you'd been looking a multiple GB of RAM for the data alone, before you did anything with it.
