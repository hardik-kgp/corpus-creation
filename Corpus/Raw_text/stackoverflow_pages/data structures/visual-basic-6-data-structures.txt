*** visual-basic-6-data-structures ***

 What are all the build in data structures for VB6 (Microsoft Access) ?  I know there are arrays, but are there other more modern data structures? 
 
 It has a  :  Does VBA have Dictionary Structure? 
 And  :  VBA: Resources for Python Programmer 
 
 Disconnected recordsets can also be useful:  syncing two lists with VBA 
 
 The excellent book Hardcore Visual Basic by Bruce McKinney includes some code for creating linked lists, stacks, etc. as part of its introduction to object-based programming with VB6. The book is now available  free online . 
 
 I don't think I understand the question. When I read it, I thought of: 
 
 Arrays 
 Collections 
 Types 
 Enums 
 
 and so forth. Not sure if I'd consider standalone class modules as part of the answer, as they can have any structure you want, rather than being a particular data structure. And, of course, VBA being COM-based, it can use any data structure from compatible COM objects. This may or may not require a type library (depends on the COM object's implementation). 
 
 You can also create your own (better accessibility/performance XML collections) in this way: 
 MS XML Collections 
 Also consider using hashtables: 
 Hash Tables 
 
 I written quite a lot of code in VB6 and for sure I used Dictionary and Collection classes a lot. But I still think that they are not enough in many cases, that's why I advise you to take a look at this library: 
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/vbcorlib/ 
 that it's a port of .NET libraries to VB6.
