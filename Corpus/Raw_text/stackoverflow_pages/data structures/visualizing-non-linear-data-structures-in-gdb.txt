*** visualizing-non-linear-data-structures-in-gdb ***

 is there an easy way to visualize non linear(non contiguous) data structures like linked list or binary trees of a program in gnu debugger(gdb).... 
 to visualize an array of structures we can simply use.... 
 
 if more indirection is needed we can also use 
 
 but above works for only linear data structures like arrays... 
 Please let me know if non linear(non contiguous) data structures likes linked list or binary trees can be visualized in a similar way... Thanks in advance... 
 
 You might give  ddd  a try. It'll even create fancy maps of your data structure. 
 
 GDB 7.x contains embedded Python interpreter (if so configured) and can be used to examine arbitrarily complicated data structures. 
 In particular, it can print contents of   and  , which are much more complicated "inside" than binary trees. 
 More info  here  and  here .
