 Are there good libraries for manipulating trees in javascript? Just to be clear, I am looking for tree as in data structure not display model. 
 
 Here are some libraries that you may find helpful: 
 arboreal.js , a "micro-library for traversing and manipulating tree-like data structures" in node.js and the browser. 
 buckets , a "complete, fully tested and documented data structure library" that includes BSTs, a heap, and a bunch of other goodies. 
 
 Two libraries to add to the list are: 
 
 t.js  - Seems to be good for traversal; 
 TreeModel  - Manipulation and traversal. 
 
 disclaimer: I built TreeModel 
 
 Wish I'd seen that solution before, because those libraries look helpful!   
 Here is one I put together which is an alternative.  Meant for traversal, manipulation and loading of hierarchical tree structures from self referencing flat tables, not for balanced binary trees.

 I am not sure what your needs are so this is a shot in the dark.
I normally use (for lightweight Javascript) an array of arrays, like this: 
 
 
 Try the DOM 
 
 
 I wrote one simple data oriented tree library called  data-tree . You can use this to create, traverse and search tree in BFS/DFS fashion. You can also import/export data from tree.  Checkout the detailed documentation at:  http://cchandurkar.github.io/Data-Tree/
