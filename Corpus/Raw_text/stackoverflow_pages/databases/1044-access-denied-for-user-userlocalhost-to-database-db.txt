*** 1044-access-denied-for-user-userlocalhost-to-database-db ***

 I tried a lot to import the sql script to create database and tables through phpmyadmin in the new site I hosted. But i'm getting the error, 
 
 1044 - Access denied for user 'user'@'localhost' to database 'db' 
 
 I tried to create a sample db directly : create database sampled; I'm getting the same access denied error. 
 I'm not able to grant privileges to the user also, i'm getting the same access denied error. 
 Following is the output of show grants command, 
 
 Any help would be appreciated. thank you. 
 
 If you are using Godaddy then  **don't**
 directly go to phpMyAdmin and run the sql command. 
 You have to go to  **MySQLÂ® Databases**
 section and create a database there. 
Then  **create a user**
 and give it the  **permission**
 to access the database you just created.
Now you can go to  **phpMyAdmin**
 and write your SQL commands. 
 Hope this helps 
 
 It is clear that the user   do not have proper privilege over the database  . You need to grant privileges for the user over the database to correct this issue. 
 If you do bot have administrative rights contact your admin for granting privileges to   on that  
 
 you have not exported database from localhost or from web server correctly follow these steps go to localhost database click export tab than select 'Custom - display all possible options 'check box few options will open in section 'output' change compression none to zipped and now click go button at bottom it will properly export your database you can now import to hosting or anywhere you want with no errors 
 
 Must Ensure that your User_Name, Password and Database name are correct.
If you are Deal with database 'sampled' then type 'sampled' in query instead of 'db' also must ensure that you don't have to use quota(') in Statement.

 For me the problem is I'm not having permissions to Create new Databasename or even Modify the name of the Database. You can contact your admin to avail privileges or if you want to quickly import the   file... then you can open the .sql file with text editor and find the following line: 
 
 After that try to import the   file...now you can successfully import all the tables!
