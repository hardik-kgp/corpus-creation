*** 1052-column-id-in-field-list-is-ambiguous ***

 I have 2 tables.   and   which has both the   field in them. How do I go about selecting the   field, because I always get this error: 
 
 Here's my query: 
 
 I could just select all the fields and avoid the error. But that would be a waste in performance. What should I do? 
 
 SQL supports qualifying a column by prefixing the reference with either the full table name: 
 
 ...or a table alias: 
 
 The table alias is the recommended approach -- why type more than you have to? 
 **Why Do These Queries Look Different?**

 Secondly, my answers use ANSI-92 JOIN syntax (yours is ANSI-89).  While they perform the same, ANSI-89 syntax does not support OUTER joins (RIGHT, LEFT, FULL).  ANSI-89 syntax should be considered deprecated, there are many on SO who will not vote for ANSI-89 syntax to reinforce that.  For  more information, see this question . 
 
 In your   statement you need to preface your id with the table you want to choose it from.  
 
 OR 
 
 
 You would do that by providing a fully qualified name, e.g.: 
 
 Which would give you the id of tbl_names 
 
 What you are probably really wanting to do here is use the union operator like this: 
 
 Here's the docs for it  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/union.html 
 
 Already there are lots of answers to your question, You can do it like this also. You can give your table an alias name and use that in the select query like this:    
 
 
 The simplest solution is a join with   instead of  . That way, the database "knows" that both   columns are actually the same, and won't nitpick on that: 
 
 If   is the only common column name in   and  , you can even use a  :

 If the format of the id's in the two table varies then you want to join them, as such you can select to use an id from one-main table, say if you have   and  , and tha id for orders is like " **101**
"," **102**
"..." **110**
", just use one for customers
