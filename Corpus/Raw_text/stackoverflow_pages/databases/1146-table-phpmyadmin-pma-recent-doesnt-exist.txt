*** 1146-table-phpmyadmin-pma-recent-doesnt-exist ***

 Solution Guys... 
 FYI i am using xampp to use phpmyadmin. and this error happens during the process of creating a database on localhost. Below is the code for config.inc file under phpmyadmin directory:  
 
 
 You have to run the create_tables.sql inside the examples/ folder on phpMyAdmin to create the tables needed for the advanced features. That or disable those features by commenting them on the config file. 
 
 i've resolved with 
 
 
 
 "You have to run the create_tables.sql inside the examples/ folder on phpMyAdmin to create the tables needed for the advanced features. That or disable those features by commenting them on the config file". 
 
 
 Only to complete de choosed answer, this is the path to the examples/ directory on Ubuntu. 
 Just use the import feature and choose "create_tables.sql.gz". 
 
 I encountered the same problem but none of your answers solved it. But I found  this link . I had to edit /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php: 
 
 **into**

 
 My problem was solved, hope it can help others. 
 
 You will find   file in   dir 
 
 Extract it and  change   prefix by   or vice versa 
 
 Then import you new script SQL :  
 
 
 Just to complete the answer - on Ubuntu/Mint you can just run: 
 
 (of course this assumes development environment where your default mysql user is root and you use no password; in other case use  ) 
 
 After I downloaded phpmyadmin from their website, I extracted the   file from the  **examples folder**
 and then I imported it from the  **'Import'**
 tab of phpmyadmin. 
It creates the database 'phpmyadmin' and the relevant table within. 
 This step might not be needed as the 12 tables were already there... 
The problem seemed to be the double underscore in the tables' names. 
 I edited   and added another underscore ( ) after the   prefix of the tables. 
 ie. 
 
 became 
 
 This solved the issue for me. 
 
 I shear the point made by user2237829. The table names in the create_tables script used a double underscore while the table names in the xampp example uses a single underscore.  
 
 This one just worked for me.... 
 The error message displayed is: 
 
 on your programme files,locate the configuration file   phpmyadmin 
 Then trace the file  
 and replace it to the code :  
 restart your XAMMP and start localhost 
 solved. 
 
 This is a  known bug  on Linux Debian. I solved using the create_tables.sql in the  official package  and changing pma_ with pma__ inside /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php 
 
 I also have same problem..
I tried everything solution in google, but still error. 
 But, now i resolved it. 
 I've resolved with make give double slash like that: 
 
 It works!! 
 
 I commented out the line with the following setting 
 
 Its not really an elegant solution, but it worked for my needs. (Just getting a basic PMA for running queries etc without UI customization). 
 Please do this only if you do not care about UI Prefs. If not, other people have answered this question very well. 
 
 Edit: 
 
 Change into:

 You can solve it just in  **1 second**
! 
 just use this url: 
 
 instead of 
 
 
 The simpliest way is to drop database phpmyadmin and run sql/create_tables.sql script.
Just login to mysql console and: 
 
 
 Run  
 
 in your unix/linux/Mac console   
 
 You can also find create_tables.sql file it  phpMyAdmin's repo . Just import it from phpMyAdmin panel. It should work.
