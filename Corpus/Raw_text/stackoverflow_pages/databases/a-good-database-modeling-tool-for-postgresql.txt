 PostgreSQL comes with the excellent pgAdmin-tool for managing the database but lacks GUI data-modeling utility? 
 I found this list:  http://www.databaseanswers.org/modelling_tools.htm 
but don't have time to evaluate them. 
 Which one do YOU recommend? 
 
 pgModeler looks promising:  http://pgmodeler.com.br 
 
 You might also want to have a look at Power*Architect.

 **WWW SQL Designer**
 is a great lightweight modeling tool, and it supports PostgreSQL. 
 **SQuirreL**
 also seems nice, I haven't tried it though. 
 
 The MySQL workbench is a fine modeling tool that's free, but you'll have to modify the SQL it generates for PostgreSQL. 
 If you have to pay, ERWin is a standard. 
 
 Commercial tools: 
 dbwrench 
 Embarcadero ER Studio 
 
 I've been satisfied for years with  PostgreSQL Maestro . It's a mature solution and easy to use, but comprehensive.
