*** a-primary-must-include-all-columns-in-the-tables-partitioning-location-error ***

 I tried to create a table with range partitioning. But it shows the following error: 
 
 A primary must include all columns in the table's partitioning
  location. 
 
 This is my SQL statement: 
 
 
 You are partitioning data using fldconfirmdate, which is part of your PK, but not a part of your UNIQUE KEY fld_id. 
 This is extracted from the  MySQL manual : 
 
 In other words, every unique key on the table must use every column in the table's partitioning expression. 
 
 Which means that, making fldconfirmdate to be a part of your UNIQUE KEY 'fld_idÂ´ will solve the problem.
