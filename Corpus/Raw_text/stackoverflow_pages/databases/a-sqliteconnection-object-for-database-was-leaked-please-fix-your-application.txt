*** a-sqliteconnection-object-for-database-was-leaked-please-fix-your-application ***

 My application give me this warning 
 
 A SQLiteConnection object for database
  '+data+data+com_example_test+database' was leaked! Please fix
  your application to end transactions in progress properly and to close
  the database when it is no longer needed. 
 
 But I close the db object and the cursor after every use. 
 
 Can you help me for understand what is the problem?
thanks!!! 
 **UPDATE!**

I try this solution from this post
 SQLite Connection leaked although everything closed 
 and I don't have memory leak anymore, is it a good solution? 
 
 **Possible Solutions**
:  
 
 You have   you have started (You should
always close the transaction once you started) 
 Check whether you have closed the cursors you have opened if you are
using   (Looks like you have done this step from the code you posted) 
 Also move the   to   block 
 You have not called   on a database before deleting it with   and then recreating it with  
 
 
 Just drag that   up into the   block. 
 
 
 
 In my case the error was caused when y try to download new data and database should be updated. 
 I solved it instantiating the database by calling a  . That cause database to be updated, so after that I try to download the new data. And worked fine. 
 
 Probably you forgot to remove the  **break point**
 of debugging 
sample: 
 
 
 
 It is giving me database object leak error.
Though the application runs fine and also logs in the Run tab but the android monitor is showing me the error and not logging the info.
