*** access-sql-date-format ***

 How can I retrieve a record based on a Date property? I'm trying: 
 
 which is the format I use but I get : 
 
 "Data type mismatch in criteria expression" 
 
 
 Problem solved: It should have been: 
 
 No quotation marks.  
 
 For where clauses use 
 
 
 You'll want to use the SQL date format: '#2011-12-16#' 
 
 Use the cast to   function,  , which will honour the machine's regional settings. That said, it still a good idea to use an unambiguous date format and the  ISO 8601  format is a good one.  
 Also note that Access doesn't have a date data type: its sole temporal data type is   and, as its name suggests,  always  has a time element accurate to one second time granule, even if that time happens to be midnight. Therefore, it is a good idea to always include a time value to one second time granule in all   literals e.g.   
 
 Another advantage to the above is that the Access UI will not attempt to reformat the   literal because it is held as a string.
