*** access-to-mysql-with-r-using-a-pre-4-1-1-authentication-protocol ***

 I need to access to a MySQL remote server, and I want to do this with the R software. 
 I set up the connection parameter but I can't access. I use this code: 
 
 And I receive this error: 
 
 I tried to connect to the database with the MySQL workbench, and it's working only if I select the option: "use the old authentication protocol". 
Hence I know that it is what I need to activate in my connection, also using R. However I don't know how to do this! I tried to disable "secure_auth" but dbConnect does not have that parameter.  
 How can I change the authorization? Thanks in advance! 
 P.s.: I can't upgrade the server password to make it compatible with post-4.1.1 protocol. 
 
 You may want to try to connect to MySQL with  RJDBC  instead - it will connect with the JDBC driver under the covers, which apparently will allow  old-style authentication .
