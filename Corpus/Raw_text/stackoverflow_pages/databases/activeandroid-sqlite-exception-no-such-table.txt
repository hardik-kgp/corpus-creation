*** activeandroid-sqlite-exception-no-such-table ***

 I'm having a problem with active-android.
I at trying to fetch user location, number of passengers and general direction.
I want to save these to phone storage in a table called "Splits" using activeAndroid.
But whenever I call the   method i get a long list of errors.
I have tried to reinstall the app, and changing my DB name in the manifest, but neither of those solutions worked.
Please keep in mind I am very new to programming, so if possible, act like I'm 5. Thank you :) 
 Here is the LogCat output 
 
 Here is my Model class for the table 
 
 My activity 
 
 My layout 
 
 I hope someone can help, I know I posted a bunch, but I am getting desperate at this point.
Thanks in advance 
 
 although late, hope this help. 
 from official page of ActiveAndroid in github: 
 "This is because ActiveAndroid  **only generates**
 the schema if there is  **no existing database file**
. In order to "regenerate" the schema after creating a new model, the easiest way is to  **uninstall the app from the emulator and allow it to be fully re-installed**
. This is because this clears the database file and triggers ActiveAndroid to recreate the tables based on the annotated models in the project." 
 
 Increment your AA_DB_VERSION in your manifest. That will force ActiveAndroid to regenerate your schema. 
 
 it seems you have forgotten to call super() on your model class in the constructor function: 
 
 Another possibility is that you didn't declare your Model class in your Manifest file. 
 
 It seems that there is no table called Splits into your db. If you have made changes on your database and you are testing your application in one real device (not emulator) you will need to remove the application from the device (or at least its data) to refresh your database. Hope it helps =) 
 
 You have probably misconfigured ActiveAndroid. Check this  tutorial , in the Common Questions section. 
 
 This initialization code: 
 
 goes into the Application class.  So you could extend the Application class and use the initialization within the OnCreate of that.
Like 
 
 Be sure that you're using this application class in the AndroidManifest.xml as your application. ie,
