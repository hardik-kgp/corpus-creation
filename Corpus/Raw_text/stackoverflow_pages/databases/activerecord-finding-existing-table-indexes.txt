*** activerecord-finding-existing-table-indexes ***

 I am writing a migration generator for a plugin I am writing and I need to to be able to find what unique indexes a table has so I can modify existing unique indexes to become a composite unique index.  I have been trying to find a way to access what indexes a table has with ActiveRecord.  I have only been able to find ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter::indexes method, but unfortunately this is only available for the PosgreSQLAdapter.  I need to be able to support the other major databases.   
 I first grepping the schema.rb file to find the indexes, this worked at first, but I soon realized this was a bad strategy. 
 I was thinking that if ActiveRecord does not provide a means to be able to do this for multiple database adapters, I may be able to write adapter specific queries to retrieve the index information from a table.  If I need to resort to this method what would be a good way to determine the adapter in use? 
 If someone knows of a way to get ActiveRecord to list table index information that would be ideal. 
 
 This works with MySQL, SQLite3, and Postgres: 
 
 But I think it only gives you the indexes you specifically created. 
 Also, to find out which adapter is in use: 
 
 
 Just an update for cleaner inspection. As I had many tables I was finding it difficult to search for specific stuffs. 
 
 This will be of quick setup. 
 
 Just in case you have multiple DBs and the proposed   doesn't work because it is pointing to other DBs. You can do this in your rails console.  
 
 Find the model you care, let's say "User" 
 User.connection.indexes("users").inspect 
 profit
