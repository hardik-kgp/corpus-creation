*** add-a-sequence-number-to-each-element-in-a-group-using-python ***

 I have a dataframe of individuals who each have multiple records.  I want to enumerate the record in the sequence for each individual in python.  Essentially I would like to create the 'sequence' column in the following table: 
 
 This is essentially the same question as  here , but I am working in python and unable to implement the sql solution. I suspect I can use a groupby statement with an iterable count, but have so far been unsuccessful. Thanks! 
 
 The question is how do I sort on multiple columns of data. 
 One simple trick is to use the   parameter to the  sorted  function. 
 You'll be sorting by a string built from the columns of the array.  
 
 
 I stumbled upon the answer which was embarrassingly simple. The groupby statement has a 'cumcount()' option which will enumerate group items. 
 
 The caveat is that the records have to be in the order you want them enumerated.  
 
 Firstly you want to convert the date column to be a pandas datetime (rather than strings): 
 
 Note: see  docs  for possible format options. 
 
 If this isn't in date order (for each patient), I would sort it first: 
 
 Now you can groupby and cumcount: 
 
 Which is what you want (althout it's out of order): 
 
 To rearrange (though you may not need to) use   (or we could reindex if we saved the initial DataFrame's index):*
