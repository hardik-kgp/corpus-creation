*** add-case-insensitive-collation-to-postgresql ***

 By default, PostgreSQL comes without case insensitive collations. Its documentation describes a way to add new collations based on OS locales, e.g.: 
 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-createcollation.html 
 however the created collations are case sensitive. 
 My question is:  **How to add a case INsensitive collation to a PostgreSQL server ?**

 Can somebody describe a workflow ? 
 I was not able to find any references on the net, while some people mention that it is possible.
I've tested with v9.1 - Debian GNU/Linux and v9.2 on Windows. 
 Just to clarify that I'm aware of: 
 
 PostgreSQL  **CITEXT**
 add-on data type 
 Usage of  **LOWER/UPPER**
 for searches and indexes. 
 
 These are not the solutions that I want. 
 
 Doesn't seem to be  possible within Postgres iteself : 
 
 Not from the Postgres project -- we just use the collations supplied by 
  the operating system. 
 
 
 " Nondeterministic collations " were added to Version 12: 
 
 "The most typical use case for nondeterministic collations is probably
  the case-insensitive comparison. At secondary strength, strings that
  differ by case compare as equal"
