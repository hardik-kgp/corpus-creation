*** add-index-to-data-model-ruby-on-rails-tutorial ***

 I am just a bit stuck on this code found in the Ruby on Rails Tutorial.org. What exactly does the  **add_index**
 part of it do? Why are there 3 lines for this? 
 
 
 
 A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of
  operations in a table. Indexes can be created using one or more
  columns, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and
  efficient ordering of access to records. -  TutorialPoint 
 
 Basically Index used to speed up the query. 
 In the example  
 
 index is created for   and   column which will speed up the query looking for    **OR**
  . It does not enforce any other constraints on your column like  **UNIQUE**
. So they can have identical values 
 Here  
 
 the process is same as above with a constraint that    **AND**
   should be distinct. An Error will be thrown if you try to insert identical values to both column
