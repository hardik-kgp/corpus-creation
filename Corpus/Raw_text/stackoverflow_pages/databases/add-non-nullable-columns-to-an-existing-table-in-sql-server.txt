*** add-non-nullable-columns-to-an-existing-table-in-sql-server ***

 I already have a table which consists of data. I need to alter the table to add two new columns which are not null. How can I do that without losing any existing data? 
 
 Here's what I tried (via right-clicking the table and selecting Design): 
 
 Added new columns 'EmpFlag' (bit, null), 'CreatedDate' (datetime,
null) 
 Updated 'EmpFlag' column in the table, to have some valid values. (Just wanted to work on one field, so I didn't update 'CreatedDate' field) 
 Now right clicked table, design, and made it not null.  
 
 When I tried to save, this error message appeared: 
 
 Saving changes is not permitted.  **The changes you have made require
  the following tables to be dropped and re-created**
. 
 
 
 You just set a default value in the new columns and that will allow you to add them. 
 
 or this one for a varchar field. 
 
 You can also drop the default if you do not need it after you added the column. 
 
 
 If you don't want to place a default on the columns, you can: 
 
 create the new columns as NULLable  
 UPDATE the existing data appropriately  
 add the NOT NULL constraint 
 
 
 Adding new NOT NULL columns with defaults can be done in the GUI like below. Changing an existing to NOT NULL appears to be a different story. I get the same message you had. One option would be to create a new NOT NULL column with a default to replace the old column and then copy the old column data to the new column data. 
 
 Put table in Design View (right click on table->select  Design ) 
 Add column, select data type 
 Uncheck  Allow Nulls  and set  Default Value or Binding  = your default values like below
