*** adding-a-leading-zero-to-some-values-in-column-in-mysql ***

 I have a CSV file sent to me in CSV. The field of interest is 8 digits. Some of those started with a 0. The field was sent numeric. So, I now have dropped some leading zeros. 
 I already converted the field to varchar. I now need to do this: 
 I have this now: 
 
 I need to have this: 
 
 
 Change the field back to numeric and use   to keep the zeros 
 or 
 use  
 
 
 Possibly:

 in response to question from mylesg, in comments below: 
 
 ok, seems to make the change on the query- but how do I make it stick (change it) permanently in the table? I tried an UPDATE instead of SELECT 
 
 I'm assuming that you used a query similar to: 
 
 If that was successful, but the table's values are still without leading-zeroes, then I'd suggest you probably set the column as a numeric type? If that's the case then you'd need to alter the table so that the column is of a text/varchar() type in order to preserve the leading zeroes: 
 First: 
 
 Second, run the update: 
 
 This should, then, preserve the leading-zeroes; the down-side is that the column is no longer strictly of a numeric type; so you may have to enforce more strict validation (depending on your use-case) to ensure that non-numerals aren't entered into that column.

 I had similar problem when importing phone number data from excel to mysql database. So a simple trick without the need to identify the length of the phone number (because the length of the phone numbers varied in my data): 
 
 I just concated 0 in front of the  .
