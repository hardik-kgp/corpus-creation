*** adding-column-to-all-tables-in-a-mysql-database-unknown-table-names ***

 I need to add a primary key to a set of tables in a given database. I do not know how many tables there will be or what their specific names are. They will all be of the for datatable_##, where ## will vary based everywhere my script will be run. 
 To add the primary key, I am using this query: 
 
 So, I need this to run on every table in the database. It seems like I can do this in a PHP script or something, but is their a simpler way to do this just in sql script? 
 
 If you want to fully script this, you can do something like this: 
 
 
 
 Once you have the output, copy and paste and run them all. 
 
 You can do the following to change the columns. This uses a cursor to iterate over the table names and does not use text files or anything. You have to create this as a stored proc as cursors cannot be used outside.
