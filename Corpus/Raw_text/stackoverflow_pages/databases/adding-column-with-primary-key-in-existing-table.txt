*** adding-column-with-primary-key-in-existing-table ***

 I am trying to add primary key to newly added column in existing table name  . 
 New Column added:   (  and  ) 
 I am trying add primary key to   (please note: there are no other primary or foreign key assigned to this table) 
 I am trying with this query but getting error.  
 
 Error: 
 
 The   statement terminated because a duplicate key was found for the object name   and the index name  . The duplicate key value is (0). 
 
 Am I missing something here? I am using SQL Server 2008 R2. I would appreciate any help. 
 
 If you want SQL Server to automatically provide values for the new column, make it an identity. 
 
 
 You are getting the error because you have existing data that does not fullfill the constraint. 
 There are 2 ways to fix it: 
 
 clean up the existing data before adding the constraint 
 add the constraint with the "WITH NOCHECK" option, this will stop sql server checking existing data, only new data will be checked 
 
 
 In mysql, I was able to achieve with following query 
 
 
 
 here   is table name, 
  is column name, 
  is we giving the primary key keyword

command:
sql> alter table tablename add primary key(col_name); 
 ex: alter table pk_Product_Detils add primary key(Product_Detail_ID);
