*** adding-fields-to-an-already-existing-database-for-django-version-1-7 ***

 I'm using Django ( < v1.7), with SQLite3 as the database engine. 
 I am trying to add a new field to an already existing model's class. This class already has data associated to it. 
  is not adding the new fields to the db. 
 Is there was a way to: 
 
 Add the new Field to the already existing class, and make sure a db entry is allocated to it? 
 Populate this new field with an empty string for all the already existing db entries? 
 
 
 Install south in your django and you can easily handle the existing tables. check  this 
 If you really want to use Django-South, install it on your django, after adding your new fields to your existing model run 
 
 python manage.py schemamigration  --initial 
 
 It will create a file in your project app. then, 
 
 python manage.py migrate  
 
 thats it your table is altered. 
 
 This answer is still getting visibility but is outdated. Since 1.7 Django ships with a  built-in migration  system, written by the same author as  , and has deprecated   though it will still work. 
 You will simply need to run a few commands to automatically add new columns: 
 
 It will be useful to understand what's happening under the hood, but those are the basics. Please ask new questions to get answers on 1.7 and migrations if you are still reading this old post. 
 
 **For django < 1.7**

  will not add any new columns.  See
 http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#syncdb 
 You will have to add them manually. For example,. replace   with relevant info: 
 
 You can see what Django might have done to generate columns on a fresh   by using: 
 
 and copying and pasting   statements from there. 
 Otherwise, you can look into third-party apps like  Django-South  which are database migration tools. 
 
 There are other options of migration apps (although South is the most used). 
 I have used  django-evolution  for my projects and it was very easy to install and start using. 
 South seems to be more complete, but for simpler tasks, django-evolution may be suitable.
