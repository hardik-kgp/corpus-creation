*** ado-net-ef-how-to-define-foreign-key-relation-in-model-first-approach ***

 I have been having previous issues regards to class inheritance and structuring a database around this and using the entity framework to no success. So I have tried to create the entities inside visual studio and see what database tables it creates automatically.  
 I have a Entity MediaItem which is Abstract and Game Inherits from this. Game has a Console (Int) which corresponds to ConsoleID. However, when I generate the database I get an extra unwanted column (ConsoleTypes_ConsoleID) inside MediaItems_Game table. Why is this and how can I prevent this from happening? Thanks. 
 
 
 First of all your model is probably wrong.   and   is not in one-to-one relation (unless you have single game for each console type). I expect 1 console can have multiple games. So it should be one-to-many. In reality game can be released on multiple platforms so it should be many-to-many.  
 You got unvanted column because your relation between   and   doesn't know that it should use   property as a foreign key. This happens if you use independent association. Independent associations are used by default when you draw them from one entity to other entity in Entity designer. You must use foreign key association. 
 Start with this set up (draw association from   to   - you must have one-to-many relation): 
 
 Select relation between   and   an in properties click on  Referential Constraint : 
 
 In  Referential Constraint  dialog just set up relation: 
 
 Save your model and generate database again.
