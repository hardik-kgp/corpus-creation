 One of the parameters in the CodeIgniter database config is the following  
 
 What do you recommend I set this to? 
Is there a significant performance hit if I set it to FALSE? 
What potential problems might arise from setting it to TRUE? 
 
 Just look up general best practices for persistent connections. My suggestions. 
 
 By default, DO NOT 
 If you have:

 
 Dedicated web server and database hardware in production 
 and have tuned the web server and database correctly 
 and have an accurate production-like test environment 
 And still think your performance problems are caused by database connection time, 
 
 
 CONSIDER turning it on  
 Persistent connections can cause 
 
 Bugs because some connection state persisted unintentionally (this is a biggie!) 
 Database connection limits to be exceeded 
 Database performance to drop because of lots of ram used by the many (mostly idle) connections 
 Bugs because connections have gone "stale" and the app didn't notice 
 
 But CAN 
 
 Reduce latency on initial connection 
 
 If you think that connection latency is causing a problem, consider turning it on in your performance test system and  measuring  the impact.
