*** alter-a-table-column-with-auto-increment-by-1-in-derby ***

 I have created a table in derby Netbeans and now i realize that i need to make a column as auto incremented by 1 which is a  **primary key**
. How can i do so? I tried the following code but was in vain. 
 
 Do i need to create the table once again or can it be possible some other way? 
 
 I have found an alternate solution, i dropped the column from the database (thanks vels4j) added the column once again from the netbeans derby UI as shown below: 
 
 
 To alter the column to be auto-generated, the code is 
 
 BUT the column must already be defined with the IDENTITY attribute (as written in this  documentation ). 
 In most cases (assuming that you too), the primary key column is not set as IDENTITY. Therefore, you may intend to alter the column to IDENTITY, but that is impossible. 
 The only way is to drop the table and create it again, as written  here . 
 
 ALTER TABLE tbl ADD id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT; 
 
 
 I guess could do the things for you
