*** alter-column-length-in-schema-builder ***

 I have two fields i need to increment the character limit on. I're read through the documentation and to my surprise i found no option for it. Is it possible to do? If not, how should i go about solving this? 
 I could drop the column and re-create it with the correct properties, but i don't want to loose any data in the database. 
 
 Use  Raw Queries : 
 
 Replace  ,  ,   and  . 
 For Laravel 5+ replace   with  . 
 
 **For Laravel 4**

 
 
 **For Laravel 5:**

 
 Check  docs  for further info. 
 
 Use `` for the column name if the name is a keyword for the system. Otherwise you will get an  "Syntax error or access violation."
