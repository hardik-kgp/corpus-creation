*** alter-table-then-update-in-single-statement ***

 I have a requirement where I need to Alter (Add 2 columns) and then update the same table. 
 Here is the query I tried: 
 
 I need to run the above two queries at a time. 
 I am using Talend ETL tool, in this we have a component tMssqlrow, which allow us to run multiple queries (I am using 10 to 15 update queries in single component). 
 But the above query is not working. 
 I tested in DataBase Microsoft SQL. i am getting the below error : 
 
 Msg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 5  
 Invalid column name 'c1'. Msg 207, 
 Level 16, State 1, Line 5  
 Invalid column name 'c2'. 
 
 can any one help me resolve this problem. 
 
 You can't do this  exactly  in a single statement (or batch) and it seems the tool you are using does not support   as a batch delimiter. 
 You can use   to run it in a child batch though.  
 
 NB: All single quotes in the query need to be doubled up as above to escape them inside a string literal.  
 Or alternatively you could achieve similar results in a single statement with the aid of some default constraints. 
 
 But this is not exactly the same as the original query as the default constraints will be left behind and may need to be dropped. 
 
 Use GO between your 2 queries. 
 
 Try this
