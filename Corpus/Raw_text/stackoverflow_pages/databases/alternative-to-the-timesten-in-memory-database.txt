 I just found " Has anyone published a
  detailed comparison between different
  in-memory RDBMSs ?" that is related
  to my question. 
 
 TimesTen  (see  also ) is a  In-Memory Database  from oracle.  
 It has a lot going for it including. 
 
 Fast, consistent response time  
 High transaction throughput  
 Standard SQL, no application rewrite  
 Persistent and recoverable  
 High availability and no data loss  
 
 However it is priced out of the reach of most people ( $41,500.00 / Processor ). 
 So what alternatives are there, and what are there pros and cons. 
 (I am using .NET if it changes your answer) 
 
 A popular in-memory database system is McObject's eXtremeDB, see 
 http://www.mcobject.com/extremedbfamily.shtml 
 There is also a good white paper, offered for download from the home page of McObject's Web site, called, "In-Memory Database Systems: Myths and Facts". It clarifies some questions that arise when discussing the technology, such as, "how is an IMDS different from a 'traditional' database running on a RAM disk?" 
 
 Generally, in this field people also look at kdb from  Kx Systems .  I think both these systems really had they hay-day in the early 2000's.  I would see if a tuned MySQL with a solid state RAID array would give you the performance you need.   
 BTW, I once wrote a time series database which outperformed both TimesTen and Kdb.  It supported a SQL-92 syntax.  The key to the performance was binding the schema to C++ template based classes, and using memory mapped files.  Allowing for on-the-run schema changes is quite expensive, and defining the schema at compile time, data lookups could be retrieved in just a few assembly instructions. 
 
 Above question was asked (and answered) way back in 2009. However, the question is still relevant and we can give a 2nd look. 
 I can suggest following alternatives to TimesTen:  
 
 **SQLite**

 
 Link:  http://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html 
 Advantages: Small footprint, It's RDBMS (no application rewrite required) 
 Disadvantages: No row-level locking 
 
 **H2**

 
 Link:  http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#in_memory_databases 
 Advantages: It's RDBMS (no application rewrite required), row-level locking 
 
 **HyperSQL**

 
 Link:  http://hsqldb.org/ 
 Advantages & Disadvantages: Very similar to H2 (above). 
 
 **Redis**

 
 Link:  http://redis.io 
 Advantages: Blazingly fast with native support for data structures like list, hash, set, sorted set etc 
 Disadvantages: Not an RDBMS (you may have to rewrite your application) 
 
 
 All of the above can run  in-memory . Features-wise you might find things missing as compared to TimesTen. But they are certainly worth a look. 
 
 Another for the list: open-source  Tarantool  is a persistent in-memory option that like TimesTen supports ACID transactions and SQL. Unlike TimesTen, though, it can be auto-sharded and also features a full Lua application server for stored procedures. 
 
 I have recently done a comparison betweem Oracle TimesTen and Sybase ASE IMDB. 
 The article is in two parts and available from the following links. 
 http://searchoracle.techtarget.com/tip/In-memory-databases-Oracle-TimesTen-vs-Sybase-ASE 
 http://searchoracle.techtarget.com/tip/In-memory-databases-Oracle-TimesTen-vs-Sybase-ASE-part-2 
 
 I asked this question a  **LONG**
 time ago, these days Microsoft SQL Server have " In-Memory OLTP " that is a memory-optimized database engine integrated into the SQL Server engine.  It is not cheap, but seems to be  **very fast**
 for some workloads. 
 
 An alternative may be solidDB, a comparison between the two may be found here:  TimesTen and solidDB comparison 
 
 Add to the list of In-Mem databases. 
 Apache Derby
HyperSQL or HSQLDB. 
 H2 and HyperSQL have compatibility mode as well to support schema of other databases, which is a very nice feature.
