*** alternative-to-using-limit-keyword-in-a-subquery-in-mysql ***

 I have a table TEST with the following columns :  
 
 Now I want to select 10 rows with a distinct value of c 
 So I wrote the following query: 
 
 This query should ideally work, but my version of MySQL says :  
 
 This version of MySQL doesn't yet support 'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME

 Can someone suggest me an alternative to this query? 
 
 The error you are getting is not exactly because of the version of MySQL. I think all versions support that. You have to change the LIMIT 10 place and place it after ")". Let me know if it works for you. I ran the bellow one on mine and it works. 
 E.g. 
 
 Update: Try the one below, this way order would work: 
 
 
 Answer suggested by Layke is wrong in my purview. Intention of using limit in subquery is so main query run on limited records fetched from subquery. And if we keep limit outside then it makes limit useless for subquery. 
 Since mysql doesn't support yet limit in subquery, instead you can use JOIN as follows: 
 
 
 Put the subquery in a derived table: 
 
 (You could also RIGHT JOIN that, of course, and drop the outer WHERE condition.) 
 
 You can also use same query, just by adding one extra layer of select before subquery. and that's it. It will work.
