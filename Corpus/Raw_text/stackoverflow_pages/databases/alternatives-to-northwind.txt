*** alternatives-to-northwind ***

 Well, what alternative sample databases exist that have: 
 
 an un-restrictive license 
 loads of sample data 
 lots of data types 
 a simple mechanism for adding the database to a db server 
 are not Northwind 
 
 I'm not too fussed what server type (MSSQL, SQLite, MySQL, etc.) the db is designed for. 
 
 How about 
 Chinook Database  
 See also  Chinook Database Schema  
 
 Microsoft do another set of sample databases called AdventureWorks (these are often used in MS courses). They canbe downloaded from here for SQL 2005  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e719ecf7-9f46-4312-af89-6ad8702e4e6e&displaylang=en#Overview . 
 I'm not sure how much sample data is shipped with it though! 
 
 This looks promising:  http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/

 Here are some  MS sample databases  from CodePlex, called AdventureWorks.
