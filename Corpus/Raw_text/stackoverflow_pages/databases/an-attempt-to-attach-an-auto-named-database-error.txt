*** an-attempt-to-attach-an-auto-named-database-error ***

 "An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\Users\John\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\PAS\PAS\bin\Debug//PatAddSys.mdf failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share." 
 What's wrong here? I have the correct code for my path ( I think) but still this error occurs here is my database path 
 
 Here's the location of My Database 
 
 
 Try setting the User Instance property in your connection string to true. You need to add this to your connection string: 
 
 Also just to be sure check again your database server as it might already contain a database with the same name. 
 Hope that helps. 
 
 Change both the current working directory and the connection string to the correct ones to solve it.  
 Select the database which is located in "Server explorer"
then copy the connection string as exactly seeing in its properties, then use it in the codes. 
 
 then for the current working directory use the same path without the database's name. Solution -> properties -> debug is where the current working directory path is located at. This works for visual studio 2015.  
 I use my connection string as this 
 
 
 i think it might be very very late BUT 
 this string give me the above error 
 
 But if add |Data Directory| before database name then it work fine 
 
 
 FOR FUTURE HELP !! 
 you've corrected it: 
 
 **BUT just have to do one step is to use the Backslash " \ " instead of SLASH " / "
so it should to be like this :**

 
 &thanks this line saved me alot of work :) 
 
 Actually I've crashed to this problem but I handled it easily.
if your connection string is  
 
 you need to make your own localDB.
first go to command prompt than write 
 
 than start your database 
 
 than return to VS and change your connection string to 
 
 
 Use this: 
 
 it will work
