*** android-add-mms-to-database ***

 I want to add some MMS messages into my device database. 
 I've the following code but it doesn't work at all. No entry are added into the native app... 
 
 
  is my view context 
  is a string array containing the addresses (eg. new String[] {"0612345678", "0623456789"}) 
  is my MMS subject such as "Sent via MyApp" 
  is an Uri pointing to the image I want to send on my SD card. 
 
 Am I doing it wrong ? 
 
 Finally I found how to do the job !
Here is the code I made. 
 Tell me if you got some troubles with this.
