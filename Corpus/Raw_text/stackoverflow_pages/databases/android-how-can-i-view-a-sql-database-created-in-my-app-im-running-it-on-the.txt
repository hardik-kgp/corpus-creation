*** android-how-can-i-view-a-sql-database-created-in-my-app-im-running-it-on-the ***

 I have an Android application that uses the Android database to create tables and store data. I'm currently running this app in the emulator in Eclipse. I have 2 questions: 
 
 Where can I find the actual database file (it must be on my computer somewhere right?) that is created when I run my app in the emulator?  
 Is there an easy way to view what is in my database/tables? 
 
 If I could find where the actual database file is (if there is such a thing) on my computer, then perhaps question 2 would be answered as easily as opening that file. But I really have no clue. Any help is appreciated. 
 
 Hi 
 1. In the Eclipse look at the File Explorer tab (near the Console tab). Or look at menu "Window -> Show View -> Other... -> File Explorer". Emulator should be run. In the File Explorer window go to the folder "data/data/[your_package_name]/databases/". There you can find your database. You can export it to the your computer. At the right top corner of the window there is a button "pull a file from device". Select database, click that button and save a database on the computer. 
 2. Program "sqlite browser" can shows a data in the database. You can download it  here . It is easy to use. 
 
 The database is stored in the following location on the emulator (assuming your app has the package   and a database named  ): 
 
 You can access it from the command line as follows: 
 
 
 If you want to browse your databases inside eclipse follow these instructions taken from here:
