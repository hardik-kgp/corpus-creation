*** android-how-do-you-detect-which-contact-changed ***

 Is there a way to determine which contact changed? 
 I know I can register a ContentObserver for the URI but it only triggers when something changes, how am I supposed to know which contact changed and what changed for that contact? Is there a way to find out? 
 My app involves a desktop client and I would prefer not to send all of the contacts over to the desktop every time it connects. So I would like to keep track of what has changed since the last time the desktop connected. 
 Thanks in advance! 
 p.s. I'm using API Level 5+ 
 
 No there is no way to get which contact had changed 
 c&p from my response related with this topic  here 
 I have this code in my Application base class. 
 
 Regarding about what you can put in projection check  here 
 Hope this helps
