*** android-how-to-exec-a-sql-file-in-sqlitedatabase ***

 i have "food_db.sql" file stored in /res/raw folder,
it has tons of 'insert' in it. 
 my question is how to i exec the file and get the data into sqlite databse in my android app? 
 here is the database code of mine. any sugguestions? 
 
 
 I wrote this one especially for you <3 
 I used the same filename as you  **"/raw/food_db.sql"**
 but that  **lead to Errors**
 instead I had to call it  **"/raw/food_db"**
. I guess its because you don't use filenames in your code, but ResourceIds which are written like "R.raw.food_db" and the dot is confusing the system.  
 There is a method for within your DbSource... assuming somewhere there is code like this: 
 
 You put this method in there: 
 
 Call it like this (I tried from an Activity, so that Toasts can output messages). Look closely, the errors are "Toasted" as well. 
 
 Enjoy! 
 Oh.. btw: This code is meant for a file in which each insert-Statement has its own line. 
 
 
 An important callout is, SQLiteDatabase.execSQL(String sql) only execute a single SQL statement, multiple statements separated by semicolons are not supported.  
 I've tried a hard time to find out why my database_init.sql doesn't work as expected. 
 
 Insert all line in one string: 
 
 
 The best way is parsing sql file, split file into statement list. 
 It not hard cause we only need to take care of commit, string and escape, but it not easy too write one in short time. 
 I found an easy way to archive this by replacing comment string by using regex, from SugarORM source code( https://github.com/chennaione/sugar/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/orm/util/MigrationFileParser.java ) 
 
 This way has limitation(we can't use "/*", "--" in sql string), but will be ok in most case. 
 hope this help
