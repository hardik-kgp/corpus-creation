*** android-how-to-make-type-converters-for-room-generic-for-all-list-of-objects ***

 I am using Room as the local database solution in my project.
For every list of a certain object type I've added type converters to the project so the type convertor would look something like this:  
 
 Problem only is that I have a whole bunch of List of different types that need to be converted, so currently I am just copying this code for every type. I would like to use generics, but so far haven't been able to figure out how to do it. 
 For example using something like: 
 
 isn't working and causes compilation error with Android Studio giving me an error telling:  **Type converters must be public**

 Anyone an idea how I can use generics for my Room TypeConverter?

 I have same problem. Partially solution just for converting listToString
