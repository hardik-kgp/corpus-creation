*** android-import-export-database ***

 there. I am trying to implement a feature into my app to copy the current database unto the sdcard.  Are there any tutorials or code snippets to achieve this. I've already looked at this site,  http://mgmblog.com/2009/02/06/export-an-android-sqlite-db-to-an-xml-file-on-the-sd-card/  ... but I wont be able to import the data with this method. 
 
 For  . 
 And refer this stackoverflow question (Making a database backup to SDCard on Android):  Making a database backup to SDCard on Android 
 
 Use the android backup service, released under android 2.2. very helpful in case of data lose or SD card corrupted your application data will be safe on google cloud. 
 Android Backup Service is integrated with Android's data backup framework to perform data backup and restore for most devices running Android 2.2 or greater, using Google servers and a backup transport on the device.
