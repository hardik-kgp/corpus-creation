*** android-is-viewholder-pattern-automatically-implemented-in-cursoradapter ***

 I always use   pattern in my custom   classes. However, in   the   method is not mandatory required to be overridden , but has the   and   methods. 
 My question is - does   re-uses views by internally implementing the   pattern or it needs to be coded as we normally do in custom  ? If it needs to be coded, what is the correct way to do it? 
 **Update**

 I'm not sure at what do you refer by the   pattern. If you are referring to having a helper class to cache looking for view each time(and setting it as a tag for the row  ) then the answer is no. If you want to implement this pattern you'll need to setup the holder(look for the views in the row view with  ) in the   method and then set it as the tag for the row view. Then in the   method you can call  , retrieve the holder and use it. An example: 
 
 If you are referring to the   being reused(like in non   based adapters) then the answer is yes, the   method implements this pattern, you just need to implement the   and   methods and you're guaranteed to get a view which was recycled(if possible at that moment). 
 
 You haven't indicated whether you are using the platform version or the support library version of  .  In either case, Android is open source, so you can look for yourself!

 If you're using Chrome, the  Android SDK Reference Search  component is super-helpful!
