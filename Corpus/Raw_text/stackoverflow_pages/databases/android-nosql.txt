*** android-nosql ***

 I am developing an app which is supposed to send data to a MySQL DB in a remote server so as to be later displayed in a webpage that grabs the data from that server, and I was wondering if it's possible to use some NoSQL solution instead of MySQL? 
 I have been reading about CouchDB and MongoDB but I still don't understand if I could use them for my purposes, as for example with MongoDB, I have to install the app on the Android phone and I still have no clue how I can install it in a remote server. 
 
 CouchBase Mobile  is probably what you are looking for. I don't think there is an equivalent solution for MongoDB yet, and it's not really what it is designed for anyway. 
 EDIT: But what is wrong with the MySQL option? 
 
 iBoxDB for Java can install in the Android emulator,hava an interface called 'IBoxRecycler' , it can collect database's data(byte[]) , then convert data to sql, and replicate to server. if server also iBoxDB, just send data don't need convert

 A new kid on the block is  JasDB . It has an exceedingly simple API and  works on Android . Examples: 
 **create object**

 
 **range query**

 
 
 There is also

 It is very lightweight (~50 KB)
The API is MongoDB-like: 
 
 You can also create Indexes:
