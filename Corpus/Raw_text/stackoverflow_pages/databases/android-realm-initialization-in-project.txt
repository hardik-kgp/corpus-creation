*** android-realm-initialization-in-project ***

 As seen in the official documentation on how to use Realm 
 
 I added dependencie to my project 
 
 I can use this library normally but  **static method init apparently does not exist**
. Can someone post an example of how to initialize and save example object to database using this library? There's really not too many tutorials and the usage looks really easy after you manage to fire it up. Realm initialization sets up default configuration right? So is there a way to bypass that static init and set it manually? 
 --EDIT 
 When I'm trying to execute this code 
 
 I get  
 
 Error:(33, 49) error: Builder(Context) is not public in Builder; cannot be accessed from outside package 
 
 
 This constructor no longer exists: 
 
 Use this instead: 
 
 The example you refer to should have been updated as well? 
 
 For me the actual problem was that Android studio couldn't update the library from some old version I initially connected to the project. Gradle had good version but actual libs files were old, solution for me was to manually re-download the files of this library.
