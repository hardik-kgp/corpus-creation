*** android-room-insertall-issues ***

 I'm starting using Android Room and I'm having some troubles. 
 I have an ArrayList of 7 Orders and when I call insertAll(List orders)
only 4 orders are inserted into the database. 
 How can I debug the insert query in order to find what is blocking ? 
 Thanks 
 
 The calls done by Room are not synchronous so probably when you perform 
 
 it is still inserting the orders. 
 Try this  
 
 
 OnConflict Property must be added.
