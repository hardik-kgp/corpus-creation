*** android-room-persistence-library-update-not-working ***

 I am trying to update my database via new android room library, but it is not working. Here it is my approach 
 
 MainActivity.java 
 
 CarViewModel.java 
 
 CarDao.java 
 
 I did debugging, new data comes and calling viewModel.updateItems(list) method.Thanks in advance! 
 
 I am sorry for posting this as an answer but I am not allowed to add a simple comment yet so here is my idea: 
 Have you tried using only   instead of  ?
Anyway it looks like your   LiveData callback gets triggered the whole time because when the observer is called the Database is altered again.. I am not quite sure what you want to accomplish tho. 
 
 Make sure the row you want to updated and model you are sending to update should have same id which you have defined as primary key. 
 
 The update means you fetch a   which is already in the database and after updating  this   you return the new values to the Database, except the Id you return the same Id   
 what to do   
 you need for example a global variable of type   and implement set functions in the    
 In MainActivity assignt the fetched CarModel to the global variable and use the set functions to update the values of member variables of the CarModel   
 then pass this global variable to the update function in MainActivity  
 I have example in  my Github like this
