*** android-room-persistences-library-and-kotlin ***

 I am trying to write a simple app using Kotlin and  Room Persistance Library .
I followed  the tutorial  in the Android Persistance codelab.  
 Here is my   class in Kotlin: 
 
 But when I tried to run the app, it crashes immediately.
Here is the crash log: 
 
 It looks like the class AppDatabase_Impl wasn't autogenerated. I checked the original java app downloaded from codelab and found that AppDatabase_Impl was autogenerated. 
 Kotlin version: 1.1.2-3
Room version: 1.0.0-alpha1 
 Is there anyone experienced with this? 
 **Edit:**

Using kapt solves my problem. In my case, I have to replace annotationProcessor with kapt. 
 
 Usually in project   I define the dependencies versions: 
 
 so in app   the dependencies look like: 
 
 Now you can define Entities Daos and Database in Kotlin. 
 Database: 
 
 Entity: 
 
 Dao: 
 
 **NB: Query with parameters.**

Kotlin renames params, so the SQL query to retrieve all the emails that belong at an user via the userId is: 
 
 
 In my case, in build.gradle, when you have "annotationProcessor" you need to duplicate with "kapt" and it works. 
 
 
 Try out these steps 
 **Step 1.**
 Set the   in the   file 
 
 **Step 2.**
 Apply the   plugin in the   file, and this solved my issue. 
 
 **Step 3.**
 Add the   dependency in the   file  
 
 
 Anyone interested in using Kotlin with Room and Data Binding can see this sample project  https://github.com/entrpn/kotlin-room-databinding 
 
 i almost gave up. but after doing just what dharmin007 said i also had to  **clean**
 the project. that made it work.  I've noticed that whenever you add kapt to gradle you MUST clean the project after synching gradle.  
 
 I don't know if there is a necessity to my answer I know that some of the above answers already included this to their answers but they added other things
