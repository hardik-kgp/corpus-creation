*** android-simplecursoradapter-doesnt-update-when-database-changes ***

 I have an Android   that is backed by a database   through a  . 
 When the items are clicked, a flag field in the coresponding row in the database is toggled and the view in the list needs to be updated.   
 The problem is, when the view that's updated goes off screen and is recycled, the old value is displayed on the view when it returns into view.  The same thing happens whenever thr list is redrawb (orientation changes, etc).   
 I use   to refresh the cursor adapter but it seems ineffective. 
 How should I be updating the database so the cursor is updated as well? 
 
 Call   on the   when you change data in the database that you want reflected in that   (or things the   populates, like a   via a  ). 
 A   is akin to an ODBC client-side cursor -- it holds all of the data represented by the query result. Hence, just because you change the data in the database, the   will not know about those changes unless you refresh it via  . 
 
 **UPDATE**
: This whole question and set of answers should be deleted due to old age, but that's apparently impossible. Anyone seeking Android answers should bear in mind that the Android is a swiftly-moving target, and answers from 2009 are typically worse than are newer answers. 
 The current solution is to obtain a fresh   and use either   or   on the   to affect a data change. 
 
  is now deprecated. from the  documentation : 
 
 This method is deprecated.
  Don't use this. Just request a new cursor, so you can do this asynchronously and update your list view once the new cursor comes back. 
 
 after obtaining a new cursor one can use the . this should update the view. 
 
 In case of using loader and automagically generated cursor you can call: 
 
 in your activity, just after changing something on a DB, to regenerate new cursor.
Don't forget to also have event handlers defined: 
 
 
 I am not clear if you set the   property of CursorAdapter to  . 
 The adapter will check the   property; if it is  , then the cursor will not be changed. 
 
 requery() is already deprecated, just implement the simple updateUI() method like this in your CursorAdapter's child class and call it after data updates: 
 
 
 It's easy.  
 
 Or use CursorLoader...
