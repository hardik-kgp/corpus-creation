 I am new to Android and I have to create an application where I need to use a SQLite database.
I am not so well equipped with the SQLite. 
 Could you tell me what the purpose and use of the   class, and provide a simple database creation and insertion example? 
 
 Sqlite helper class helps us to manage database creation and version management.
SQLiteOpenHelper takes care of all database management activities. To use it, 
     1.Override   methods of  . Optionally override onOpen() method.
     2.Use this subclass to create either a readable or writable database and use the SQLiteDatabase's four API methods   to create, read, update and delete rows of your table. 
 Example to create a MyEmployees table and to select and insert records:  
 
 Now you can use this class as below, 
 
 Now you can use MyDB class in you activity to have all the database operations. The create records will help you to insert the values similarly you can have your own functions for update and delete.

 **Database Helper Class:**

 A helper class to manage database creation and version management. 
 You create a subclass implementing  ,   and optionally  , and this class takes care of opening the database if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading it as necessary. Transactions are used to make sure the database is always in a sensible state. 
 This class makes it easy for   implementations to defer opening and upgrading the database until first use, to avoid blocking application startup with long-running database upgrades.  
 You need more refer this link  Sqlite Helper 
 
 The DBHelper class is what handles the opening and closing of sqlite databases as well sa creation and updating, and a decent article on how it all works is  here . When I started android it was very useful (however I've been objective-c lately, and forgotten most of it to be any use. 
 
 Using Helper class you can access SQLite Database and can perform the various operations on it by overriding the onCreate() and onUpgrade() methods.
