*** android-sqlite-exception-unable-to-close-due-to-unfinalised-statements ***

 I am writing an android shopping manager application and have come across an error when trying to close one of my SQLite database tables.  
 
 This doesn't happen with other calls to this class so and I am wondering if it is because there is a loop with a lot of calls to the database here. 
The error is  . 
 The error line from the "ItemsDb" class is here 
 
 Apparently SQLite3 has a finalize method for destroying previous DB calls but I am not sure how to implement this or even if it is necessary here. 
 Any help on this would be great. 
 
 It seems the problem was cursor related, thanks Jivings. I wasn't closing the cursor after I queried the database, which meant certain references to the database were invalid. 
 
 Calling "c.close" seemed to do the trick.
