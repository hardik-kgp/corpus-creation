*** android-sqlite-which-query-query-or-rawquery-is-faster ***

 I am developing one android database application . I just want to know which code execute faster and what is the difference between them? 
 **Query - 1**
 = 
 
 **Query - 2**
 =  
 
 
 Use query. 
 Android precompile queries and using too many different raw queries may cause performance issue. 
 Use rawQuery only when absolutely needed. 
 Also, both your example have a MAJOR security issue of SQL Injection. 
 You should sanitize the userId. 
 The most obvious thing to do is let Android do it by using: 
 
 
 Looking at SQLiteDatabase.java in the android source shows that the query(..) ends up calling the QueryBuilder to build the query as a single string and then it essentially calls rawQuery(). They should be roughly equivalent, assuming that you also did the same work to build your own statement.
