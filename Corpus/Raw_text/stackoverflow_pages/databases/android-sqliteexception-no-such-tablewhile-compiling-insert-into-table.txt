 I had the same problem building my application I tried everything and nothing worked. The database was just fine along with the table name. 
 Caused by: android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: no such table: (code 1) Android 
 **Solution:**

The only way that solved the problem was to un-install the application from the emulator: 
 1- Open the emulator , go to Settings
2- click on Apps
3- scroll to find your Application name
4- Double click on it
5- Force Stop
6- UnInstall it. 
 run your application again from android studio and try to check the database connectivity. This worked for me , good luck.
