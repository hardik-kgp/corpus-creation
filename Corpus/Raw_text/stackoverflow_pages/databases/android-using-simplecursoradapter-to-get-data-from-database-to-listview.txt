*** android-using-simplecursoradapter-to-get-data-from-database-to-listview ***

 I am programming an android app that should use a database to store data and read from it. Using  this tutorial (on archive.org)  I got the app to create a database and I'm able to create new entries, however, I don't know, how to read the database to get the stored data in a ListView. I know there are many similar questions on this website but it seems none of them apply to the way, the database from the tutorial works. 
 Code: 
 
 Edit: The ListView ID was wrong since it had to be android:list. 
 
 Using the database format in the tutorial that you linked to, every row has an  ,  ,  , and  . Now let's assume that you want to display every title in a ListView: 
 
 (You don't need to loop through the Cursor yourself, an adapter does this work for you!) 
 The last two parameters in your SimpleCursorAdapter constructor are what you are missing. They are the "from" and "to" parameters:   
 
 We want to get the name of each book which is stored in the column name  , this is where we get the information "from".  
 Next we need to tell it where "to" go:   is a TextView in the   layout. (You can dig through your SDK and see the simple_list_item_1.xml file yourself or just trust me for the moment.) 
 
 Now both the "from" and "to" parameters are arrays because we can pass more than one column of information, try this adapter as well: 
 
 With this adapter the books in their database will displayed by title, then publisher. All we had to do is use a layout   that takes two fields and define which columns go to which TextViews. 
 I hope that helps a little. There's plenty more to learn but maybe this will give you some basics.

 Off the top of my head, to refresh the ListView after adding new data try this: 
 
 You'll have to define   and create a variable for   but that's simple: 
 
 And change getData() accordingly: 
 
 Good luck! 
 
 An adapter isn't used on each item in the cursor, one adapter is created for the entire cursor.You can set this listview to use that cursor. Try some SimpleCursorAdapter tutorials like  this
