*** android-where-are-database-files-stored ***

 I created a SQLite database on Android device. The program can read/write to database so the database file has obviously been created. The SQLiteDatabase.mPath is set to 
 
 but when I browse the directories on the device I can't locate the file clientDB.db. I looked inside data directory  but it appears to be empty. 
 Does anyone know what could be wrong here? 
 
 If you mean you visited   and found nothing in it, and you are examining an ordinary piece of Android hardware, that is expected. DDMS does not have permission to browse through  . 
 However, at least if your app is compiled in debug mode, you can use the   command at the console to download your file directly. 
 
 try getDatabasePath on ContextWrapper (  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContextWrapper.html  ).  If you are in an Activity or Application class try: 
 
 Just assuming its in   is bad as there is no guarantee the data has not been moved to the SD card or the device/OS has just decided on a different data directory. 
 
 In debug mode you can use  **adb shell**
 and browse the directory content. In the shell you can call  **sqlite3 /data/data/dev.client.android/databases/clientDB.db**
 to analyse the DB.
