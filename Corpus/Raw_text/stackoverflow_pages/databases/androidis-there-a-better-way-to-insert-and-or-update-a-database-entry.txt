*** androidis-there-a-better-way-to-insert-and-or-update-a-database-entry ***

 I have a database containing a userId and a note. The user doesn't know if there already is a note in the DB so they write one and click the 'Submit' button. I want to insert this note if there is no note for the userId or update that userId's already existing note: 
 
 So, I'm pretty much attempting to 'update' an entry and if I fail then I attempt to 'insert' it. I don't know SQL very well, but I would think there would be a better way. Thanks. 
 
 It sounds like you could use sqlite's  REPLACE  to solve this problem, using  . 
 
 You can catch a constraint exception launched in case of previous ID existence and then update. 
 
 
 Try this 
 result = db.insertWithOnConflict("tablename ", null, cv, -1);
