 I am looking for how to build a relational mysql database, and I would like to follow a tutorial.   
 I need one that shows how to make multiple tables, and link those together using an id.  Which I can later use to grab relational data from the different tables.  This is probably easy stuff, but I am just learning about databases. 
 Thanks for the help! 
 
 Here is a really good one for MySQL beginners.  Nettus have some really great articles on Internet technologies.  They are the new w3school.

 If you haven't already, I'd start with the  MySQL reference   Tutorial , and then perhaps over to  SQLZoo .
