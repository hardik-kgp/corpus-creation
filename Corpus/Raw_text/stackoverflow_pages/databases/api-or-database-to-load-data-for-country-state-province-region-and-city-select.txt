 anyone know of a solution? i have found online a select menu for countries, but i need either an API or a database with every state/province and major city in each country.  
 
 Take a look at  GeoNames . You can download (just about) everything they have and create your own local databases, or you can use their REST  Webservice  API. As an added bonus, they even have already made  client libraries . 
 
 If you just want users to be able to select a location, you could use a search-based interface such as  OSM Nominatim . You can download the data and install it yourself, or just use their web services (subject to usage limits). Indeed, you might be able to download the Nominatim database and write a different API to use menus to drill down.
