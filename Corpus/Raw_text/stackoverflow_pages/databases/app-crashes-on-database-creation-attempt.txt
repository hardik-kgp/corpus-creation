*** app-crashes-on-database-creation-attempt ***

 I created an sql database using "SQLite Database Browser", dragged and dropped it into my Xcode project, and built the app. It works perfectly well on the Simulator but crashes on the iPhone, with this error:   
 
 Here's my code:  
 
 Again, this works on the Simulator, but not on the iPhone. (This couldn't possible have anything to do with the file have a ".sql" extension as opposed to a ".sqlite" extension, could it? Cause that's the extensions that "SQLite Database Browser" gives the files it creates...) 
 
 The answer has to do with making sure the "Target Membership" of the sql file is set properly, so that the project "sees" it:  
 1) click on the sql file in the left-pane of Xcode 
 2) open/show the File Inspector (right pane) 
 3) Under "Target Membership", make sure the "check" is "checked" 
 that's it. 
 
 
 This solution resolves my problem i hope it will helps you out. 
 
 in my issue:
check this row:  
 
 Check the fileName in your bundle and in code - the error also is cased of different filenames.
