*** appending-data-to-a-mysql-database-field-that-already-has-data-in-it ***

 I need to "add" data to a field that already contains data without erasing whats currently there.  For example if the field contains HTML, I need to add additional HTML to the field.   Is there a SQL call that will do this or do I need to call the data in that field, concatenate the new data to the existing data, and reload it into the database? 
 
 
 
 
 ... for example.  Your WHERE would be different of course. 
 
 Append at the end of a field, separated with with a line break: 
 
 
  appends multiple strings separated by a given separator.  
  is a line break.  
 
 
 
 If the field contains NULL value then CONCAT will also return NULL. Using IFNULL will help you to update column even it has NULL value.
