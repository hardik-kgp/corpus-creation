*** appropriate-database-for-web-analytics ***

 I am working on the Web analytics similar to  Google Analytics , and currently using  MongoDB . 
 **Problem using MongoDB**

 Writing and reading is performed at the same time, so after some point writing becomes slow. So I am looking for an appropriate database which suits the following requirements : 
 **Requirements**

 
 It should be Open Source 
 Is scalable, and can adapt large volumes of data 
 Better performance while aggregating data 
 Time based aggregation 
 Real time data processing 
 Has Driver support (clients) for Node.js and Java 
 
 **The Database should be scalable with Node.js and Java**

 I am saving the data using Java, and fetching it via Node.js 
 
 I think you are looking for DBs that are designed for analytics. Those would be databases which support large amount of reads as well as writes on storage.
May be you should check these solutions:.  
 **some opensource data storage solutions specific to realtime analytics**

 
 Druid 
 Spark 
 Cassandra 
 Hbase 
 hypertable 
 accumulo 
 
 **note:**

Here I think cassandra would have  appropriate drivers  for languages that you are looking for and would be a good fit when you have large read and write operations. We can see cassandra being used in java/storm based projects which are aimed at real time processing.
