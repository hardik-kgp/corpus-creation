*** are-generic-classes-not-supported-as-models-in-entity-framework ***

 I am trying to do something like this : 
 
 But I guess   is not supported. I get this error:  
 
 Additional information: The type 'TrackerEnabledDbContext.AuditLog`1[System.String]' was  not mapped. 
      Check that the type has not been explicitly excluded by using the Ignore method or NotMappedAttribute data annotation. 
      Verify that the type was defined as a class, is not primitive or generic, and does not inherit from EntityObject. 
 
 **Is there any ways I can implement **
** ?**

 
 You cannot map the generic type because Entity Framework simply doesn't support generic Entity types. 
When using the EF Code-First approach you need to remember that you should model your  POCO classes  within the constraints that allow Entity Framework to create  POCO proxies .  
 This means, shortly speaking that such a class:  
 
 Should not contain any attributes 
 Should not be generic 
 Should be public 
 Must not be sealed 
 Must not be abstract 
 Must have a public or protected constructor that does not have parameters 
 
 
 I have been using generic classes with success in Entity Framework.
If you declare your class and DbSet the following way it will work. 
 
 [Update]
I have not used this method recently and in the light of the comments on this answer I suggest Pawel's answer instead.
However I have not deleted this answer since I was able to use the method.
