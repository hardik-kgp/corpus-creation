*** are-there-any-gotchas-in-deploying-a-cassandra-cluster-to-a-set-of-linode-vps ***

 I am learning about the Apache Cassandra database [sic]. 
 Does anyone have any good/bad experiences with deploying Cassandra to less than dedicated hardware like the offerings of Linode or Slicehost?   
 I think Cassandra would be a great way to scale a web service easily to meet read/write/request load...  just add another Linode running a Cassandra node to the existing cluster.  Yes, this implies running the public web service and a Cassandra node on the same VPS (which many can take exception with). 
 Pros of Linode-like deployment for Cassandra: 
 
 Private VLAN; the Cassandra nodes could communicate privately 
 An API to provision a new Linode (and perhaps configure it with a "StackScript" that installs Cassandra and its dependencies, etc.) 
 The price is right 
 
 Cons: 
 
 Each host is a VPS and is not dedicated of course 
 The RAM/cost ratio is not that great once you decide you want 4GB RAM (cf. dedicated at say SoftLayer) 
 Only 1 disk where one would prefer 2 disks I suppose (1 for the commit log and another disk for the data files themselves).  Probably moot since this is shared hardware anyway. 
 
 EDIT: found this which helps a bit:  http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/CassandraHardware   
 I see that 1GB is the minimum but is this a recommendation?  Could I deploy with a Linode 720 for instance (say 500 MB usable to Cassandra)?  See  http://www.linode.com/ 
 
 How much ram you needs really depends on your workload: if you are write-mostly you can get away with less, otherwise you will want ram for the read cache. 
 You do get more ram for you money at my employer, rackspace cloud:   http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers/pricing .  (our machines also have raided disks so people typically see better i/o performance vs EC2.  Dunno about linode.) 
 Since with most VPSes you pay roughly 2x for the next-size instance, i.e., about the same as adding a second small instance, I would recommend going with fewer, larger instances than more, smaller ones, since in small numbers network overhead is not negligible. 
 I do know someone using Cassandra on 256MB VMs but you're definitely in the minority if you go that small.
