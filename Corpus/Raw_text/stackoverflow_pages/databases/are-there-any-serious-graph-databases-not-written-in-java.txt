*** are-there-any-serious-graph-databases-not-written-in-java ***

 I am looking for a serious graph database system which is not written in Java.  
 I am  **not**
 interested in RDF databases, since I expect to be able to store more complex graphs (actually hypergraphs) From within the Java camp, OrientDB is a good example of what I am looking for. 
 **Disclaimer:**
  This is not flamebait. I have nothing against Java, I just want to have an idea of what is out there, implemented in other languages, perhaps as an extension to other dbms, such as MySQL, MongoDb or CouchDb. 
 
 Depending on what your requirement is, you could try out  Phoebus .
It isn't exactly a GraphDB but more of a distributed graph processing framework. 
 
 I am now testing the  OQGRaph  engine of MySQL. It looks promising but doesn't seem to support multi-graphs. 
 
 Cayley  is an open-source graph inspired by the graph database behind Google's Knowledge Graph, and it is written in  Go . 
 
 There is  DEX  and  InfinitGraph  both are free to use (in certain) conditions but not foss 
 
 VTK  has graph classes. It has a filter to transform graphs to tables, and another to transfer it back. It has SQL connection, too. It could work with  boost , too.
