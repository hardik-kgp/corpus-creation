*** asp-net-mvc-2-localization-globalization-stored-in-the-database ***

 I've been searching for a while for a good example of localizing an C# ASP.NET MVC 2 application but storing the data in the database instead of .RESX files.  Unfortunately I've had no luck finding a good example and was hoping someone else may know and could point me in the right direction? 
 Many thanks for any help/advice/articles
