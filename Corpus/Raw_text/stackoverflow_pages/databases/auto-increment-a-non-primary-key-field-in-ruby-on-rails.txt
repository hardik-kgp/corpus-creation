*** auto-increment-a-non-primary-key-field-in-ruby-on-rails ***

 In a RoR migration, how do I auto increment a non-primary-key field? I'd like to do this in the db definition, and not in the model. 
 
 You need to execute an SQL statement. 
 
 you can entry manually in your migration 
 Note this is just an example. The final SQL statement syntax depends on the database.
