*** auto-increment-id-in-h2-database ***

 Is there a way to have an auto_incrementing BIGINT ID for a table.
It can be defined like so 
 
 but that has no effect (it does not increment automatically).
I would like to insert all fields but the ID field - the ID field should be provided by the DBMS.
Or do I need to call something to increment the ID counter? 
 
 It works for me. JDBC URL:  
 
 result: 
 
 
 
 The modern approach uses the   type, for automatically generating an incrementing 64-bit long integer.  
 This single-word syntax used in H2 is an abbreviated variation of   defined in the  SQL:2003  standard. See summary in PDF document  SQL:2003 Has Been Published . Other databases are implementing this,  such as Postgres . 
 
 
 Very simple: 
 
 H2 will create Sequence object automatically 
 
 You can also use  :
