*** autoincrement-uniqueidentifier ***

 Basically I want to use uniqueidentifier in similar way as identity. I don't want to insert values into it, It should just insert values automatically, different value for each row.
I'm not able to set autoincrement on columns of type uniqueidentifier(the property 'autoincrement' is set to false and is not editable). 
 
 Or even better: use the   as the default for your UNIQUEIDENITIFER column. That'll give you a somewhat sequential series of GUIDs. 
 
 Trouble is: newsequentialid is  only  available as a column default - you cannot call it as a function or anything. But that seems to fit your requirements. 
 **UPDATE:**
 there appears to be an acknowledged bug in SQL Server Management Studio that prevents specifying   as the default for a column in the interactive table designer. 
 See:  http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqltools/thread/cad8a4d7-714f-44a2-adb0-569655ac66e6 
 Workaround: create your table without specifying any default, and then type in this T-SQL statement in a normal query window and run it: 
 
 That should do the trick! 
 
 I guess you mean in SQLServer and not C#... 
 Set the column as PRIMARY KEY and ROWGUID

 Use NewID() as the default value. At least this is what you would do for SQL Server.  
 
 I think 
 
 is simplier
