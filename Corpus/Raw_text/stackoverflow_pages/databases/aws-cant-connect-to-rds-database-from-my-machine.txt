*** aws-cant-connect-to-rds-database-from-my-machine ***

 The EC2 instance/live web can connect just fine to the RDS database. But when I want to debug the code in my local machine, I can't connect to the database and got this error: 
 
 OperationalError: (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on 'aa9jliuygesv4w.c03i1
  ck3o0us.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com' (10060)") 
 
 I've added   and   keys to   and I already configure EB CLI. I don't know what should I do anymore. 
 FYI: The app is in Django 
 
 It turns out it is not that hard. Do these steps: 
 
 Go to EC2 Dashboard 
 Go to Security Groups tab 
 Select and only select the RDS database security group. You'll see the security group detail at the bottom 
 Click Inbound tab 
 Click Edit button 
 Add Type:MYSQL/Aurora;Protocol:TCP;Range:3306;Source:0.0.0.0/0 
 
 
 
 **MAKE SURE **
** IS SET TO YES**

 This is what I spent the last 3 days trying to solve... 
 
 Make sure that your VPC and subnets are wide enought. 
 The following CIDR configuration works great for two subnets: 
 
 VPC
 
 
 Subnet 1
 
 
 Subnet 2
 
 
 
 Adjust it if you need three subnets. 
 
 I wasn't being able to connect to my RDS database. I've manually reviewed any detail and everything was alright. There were no indications of any issues whatsoever and I couldn't find any suitable information in the documentation. My VPC was configured with narrow CIDR: 10.0.0.0/22 and each subnet had a 255 addresses. After I've changed CIDR to 10.0.0.0/16 and split it totally between two subnets my RDS connection started to working. It was a pure luck that I've managed to find a source of the problem, because it doesn't make any sense to me.
