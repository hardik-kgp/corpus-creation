*** aws-rds-sql-server-unable-to-drop-database ***

 I tried to migrate a SQL Server database by Export Data-tier Application (  file) from an Amazon RDS instance to other, but import didn't succeed. So now I want to delete the database (which is empty), when I try to: 
 
 I get the error:  
 
 Cannot drop the database 'mydatabase', because it does not exist or
  you do not have permission 
 
 Some context: 
 
 I've tried using SQL Server Management Studio, and choosing close connections: same error.  
 I'm logged as master user.  
 I can create and drop other databases, but not this one.  
 I just have these effective permissions on this database:  ,  ,  ,   (don't know why or how is this possible). 
 
 Any help is greatly appreciated! 
 
 I ran into this same issue. After trying to restore a database via SSMS using a .bacpac, it fails and leaves you with a database that you appear to not have permissions to drop. 
 A workaround, is to use the rdsadmin rename function to rename it to something else, which then seems to fix the permission issue and allows you to drop it. 
 
 Then just drop the DB. Hope that helps someone else in the same predicament. 
 
 This is answer for old thread but the answer would help somebody running over the same issue. 
 I run in to the same problem , but in my-case my database was in offline mode. If the database is in offline mode , it won't allow you to drop it with drop command. first you should bring the database back to online by running this sp and then execute drop table command. 
 
 
 Sounds like your not a member of the correct role.

 **Permissions**

 A DAC can only be deleted by members of the sysadmin or serveradmin fixed server roles, or by the database owner. The built-in SQL Server system administrator account named sa can also launch the wizard.

 **Permissions**

 SQL Server  - Requires the CONTROL permission on the database, or ALTER ANY DATABASE permission, or membership in the db_owner fixed database role. 
 Azure SQL Database  - Only the server-level principal login (created by the provisioning process) or members of the dbmanager database role can drop a database. 
 Parallel Data Warehouse  - Requires the CONTROL permission on the database, or ALTER ANY DATABASE permission, or membership in the db_owner fixed database role. 
 
 If your database is in a Multi-AZ deployment, then you need to run this command to drop those databases:
