*** aws-why-does-my-rds-instance-keep-starting-after-i-turned-it-off ***

 I have an RDS database instance on AWS and have turned it off for now.  However, every few days it starts up on its own.  I don't have any other services running right now. 
 There is this event in my RDS log:
"DB instance is being started due to it exceeding the maximum allowed time being stopped." 
 Why is there a limit to how long my RDS instance can be stopped?  I just want to put my project on hold for a few weeks, but AWS won't let me turn off my DB?  It costs $12.50/mo to have it sit idle, so I don't want to pay for this, and I certainly don't want AWS starting an instance for me that does not get used. 
 Please help! 
 
 That's a limitation of this  new feature . 
 
 You can stop an instance for up to 7 days at a time. After 7 days, it will be automatically started. For more details on stopping and starting a database instance, please refer to  Stopping and Starting a DB Instance  in the Amazon RDS User Guide. 
 
 You can setup a cron job to stop the instance again after 7 days. You can also change to a smaller instance size to save money. 
 Another option is the upcoming  Aurora Serverless  which stops and starts for you automatically. It might be more expensive than a dedicated instance when running 24/7. 
 Finally, there is always  Heroku  which gives you a  free database instance  that starts and stops itself with some limitations.
