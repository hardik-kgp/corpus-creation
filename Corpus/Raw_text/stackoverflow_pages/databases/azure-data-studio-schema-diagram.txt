*** azure-data-studio-schema-diagram ***

 I just recently downloaded Azure Data Studio with SQL Server Express since I'm using Linux .  Is there an entity-relationship diagramming feature, kind of how SQL Server Management Studio has a database diagram feature?  I want to visually see the relationships with tables in a database if possible. 
 
 Unfortunately, this is not possible. There is no database schema diagram for the moment in Azure Data Studio. This feature has been requested in 2017  https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues/94  and still no updates on that.  
 
 Leaving this here for future people asking this question. While Azure Data Studio does not support this, DBeaver does and it's cross platform.  https://dbeaver.io/ 
 I had this same issue and by right clicking the dbo under your databases Schemas folder in the database explorer, you can choose "View Diagram" and it will build a view just like SQL Server Management Studio does.
