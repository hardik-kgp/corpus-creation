*** backup-and-restore-option-not-available-in-pgadmin-iii ***

 I have to take backup of my database but when I right click DB and then backup  The button for backup is disabled. Similarly in existing database ,not able to restore because the Restore button too disabled. 
I was working fine till the time I created a new database. 
 How do they get enabled? 
 
 I had the same problem in ubuntu 14.04. It was necessary to install both postgresql-client-common (which contains pg_dump and pg_restore)  **and**
 postgresql-client packages. 
 
 There is no need for reinstall,
just open File->Options->Binary paths and add set "PG bin path" to path where pg_dump/pg_restore is located.
 
 
 Here is a solution: 
 
 
 Problem could be caused by a fact that you simply do not have pg_dump and pg_restore tools installed (or they are not visible for pgadmin). 
 This had happen to me when installing pgadmin3 on CentOS 7 via  PostgreSQL yum repository . To resolve this I had to install package with those tools - in my case postgresql94 (PostgreSQL client programs and libraries). 
 On other distros you will need to find which package should be installed. AFAIK this issue is not present in Windows environment, pgadmin installer probably have all needed dependencies. 
 
 Just reinstall your PGAdmin3. 
 We had the same problem on a Mac and after reinstallation, the right click menu showed more options like "Restore" and "Backup". 
 
 I had this issue (restore button disabled) and the problem was a corrupted dump. 
 So, I've created a new dump and tried again. After selecting the new file, the button became available. 
 
 in my case i'm on windows, 
 if python isn't installed, install it. 
 restart, and you're done.
