 How do I backup MySQL users and their privileges?    
 Anything like mysqldump?  
 I am looking for something like: 
 
 
 
 
 You can backup mysql database using 
 
 and restore mysql database by executing  
 
 Dont forget to  
 
 after restoring dump. 
 Hope it helps... 
 
 So far my experience with MySQL i didn't see anything to backup user and their privileges through a command line. 
 But i can backup those critical data by backing up mysql 
 
 
 The users and privileges are stored in the databased named 'mysql'.  You can use mysqldump to backup the tables in the databased named 'mysql'. 
 
 Percona has a great tool for this.   will dump users and their permissions so you can easily reload them.

 Good practice is using script for daily backup MySQL users and their privileges.
Take take a look on a one: 
 
 Result of this script will be mysqldump file with users and privileges. 
 P.S. If your MySQL requires password - put   or   after   in two places. 
 
 The scripts given above give the general idea, but they're inefficient.  They're forking/execing mysql n+1 times.  It can be done in only two calls to mysql 
 
 If there are users other than root that you don't want to backup use or and specify user != 'whatever' in the where clause of the first mysql call. 
 
 probably pretty obvious for mysql command liners but for spirit's answer above had to add -u root -ppassword after both mysql commands   
 
 mysql -u root -ppassword -BNe "select concat('\'',user,'\'@\'',host,'\'') from mysql.user where user != 'root'" | while read uh; do mysql -u root -ppassword -BNe "show grants for $uh" | sed 's/$/;/; s/\\/\/g'; done > grants.sql;
