*** batch-update-returned-unexpected-row-count-from-update-actual-row-count-0-exp ***

 I'm having difficulty to figure out NH exception: 
 
 Batch update returned unexpected row count from update; actual row
  count: 0; expected: 1 
 
 My Dal code: 
 
 My log4net file: 
 
 command 0:UPDATE Metadata_FriendDetails SET UserId = @p0, Email = @p1,
  Name = @p2 WHERE FriendId = @p3;@p0 =
  a358ab9d-d481-4bdd-8cb2-18ddc8898c70 [Type: Guid (0)], @p1 =
  '1@hotmail.com' [Type: String (4000)], @p2 = 'myFriend' [Type: String
  (4000)], @p3 = 2ea35658-edb1-43e3-b848-e1915d1042df [Type: Guid (0)]

 Does anyone see the problem? 
 TIA 
 
 the problem was that on Save I shouldn't supply the id value and on update I must supply it. 
 
 You must set the Id object to   before saving.
