*** bcnf-decomposition ***

 I am trying to figure out the correct steps in performing a BCNF decomposition.  I found this example, but I do not understand how to perform the correct steps. 
 Schema = (A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H)
FD's + {A -> CGH, AD->C, DE->F, G->G} 
 Could someone show the correct steps? 
 
 Determine a minimal cover using your FD's: 
 
 Note   drops out because   alone determines   which implies   is redundant in the FD (see Armstrong's Axioms - Augmentation). 
 3NF and BCNF definitions relate to dependencies about compund keys. The only compound key
you have here is  . Neither   or   participate in any other non-null FD's
so eliminating transitive dependencies and ensuring that dependent attributes rely on the
'key, the whole key, and nothing but the key' is not an issue here. 
 Break into relations so that the FD left hand side is the key and the right hand sides
are the non-key dependent attributes of that key: 
 
 Now eliminate these attributes from the cover, whatever is left are standalone relations. 
 
 This should be in 3NF/BCNF
