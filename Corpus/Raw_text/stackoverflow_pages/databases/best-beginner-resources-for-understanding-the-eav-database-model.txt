 I'm doing some custom work with Magento, which has a database design based upon the EAV model, and I need some good resources/tutorials that explain the EAV database model. Please don't provide Wikipedia as a resource... I'm looking for something that teaches EAV in a friendly way for beginners. 
 
 Here you go. An illustrative story:  http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/bad-carma/ 
 
 The friendliest thing you can do for a beginner is to teach them the down side of EAV. 
 The up side of EAV is so seductive that a lot of newbies will dig a very big hole for themselves before they realize it.   
 Hopefully the google search will reveal at least some of the down side. 
 
 In a nutshell, EAV is optimized for getting data in, not getting data out.  But that might be an acceptable trade-off.  I managed a project that had to develop a general clinical trial data management system.  There could not be many common data elements because each trial needs to collect different data.  Capturing data was urgent; we had to develop data entry pages under pressure.  Reports are harder with EAV, but they're also less urgent, and with some clever thought they can be simplified a bit.  EAV has served us well.   
 
 I found this guide to be the most helpful for Magento:  http://alanstorm.com/magento_advanced_orm_entity_attribute_value_part_1   
 
 I found this article really helpful, it provides considerations and consequences associated with an EAV schema and to provide a basic framework for its implementation in SQL Server.

 You should check this article:  The EAV/CR Model of Data Representation . 
 It describes EAV with Classes and Relationships, a more OO approach and not just a plain reference-key-value implementation.
