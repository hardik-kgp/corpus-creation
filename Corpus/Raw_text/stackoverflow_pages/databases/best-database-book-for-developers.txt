 Funny that no one seems to mention  Date's "SQL and relational theory : How to write accurate SQL code". 
 
 Head First SQL  (O'Reilly) is excellent, whole series is great. 
 They start of with the basics (as do most books), covering syntax, database design and advanced querying.

 Is your data dragging you down? Are your tables all tangled up? Well
  we've got the tools to teach you just how to wrangle your databases
  into submission. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive
  science, and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory SQL learning
  experience, Head First SQL has a visually rich format designed for the
  way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to
  sleep. 
 Maybe you've written some simple SQL queries to interact with
  databases. But now you want more, you want to really dig into those
  databases and work with your data. Head First SQL will show you the
  fundamentals of SQL and how to really take advantage of it. We'll take
  you on a journey through the language, from basic INSERT statements
  and SELECT queries to hardcore database manipulation with indices,
  joins, and transactions. We all know "Data is Power"â€”but we'll show
  you how to have "Power over your Data". Expect to have fun, expect to
  learn, and expect to be querying, normalizing, and joining your data
  like a pro by the time you're finished reading!
