*** best-database-for-node-js-app-using-websockets ***

 I am learning Node.js and the simple app I am creating will store 3 values in a database: latitude, longitude, message. 
 The app will then pull out any message that is located within a certain distance from your current location. The websockets just keeps your location up to date if you move around. 
 I know how I would do this using MySQL, but I thought there might be a more appropriate database that works well with Node.js. 
 Any suggestions? 
 
 Any key-value store is perfect for node.js since they store data as native JS objects or JSON. 
 Some popular ones include: 
 
 MongoDB 
 Redis 
 Couch 
 Riak 
 
 Here's a list of database modules for node.js:  https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#database

 It lets you do spatial queries with CouchDB.  It is very easy to talk to CouchDB from node.js because the API is JSON over HTTP.
