 I have a simple table  comments   with some content like this: 
 
 I'm searching for an SQL statement which will return each comment with the highest revision: 
 
 I've come up with this solution: 
 
 but it is very slow on large data sets. Are there any better queries to accomplish this? 
 
 Here's one way that with appropriate indexing will not be heinously slow and it doesn't use a subselect: 
 
 Adapted from queries here:

 (From google search: max group by sql) 
 
 
 Make sure you have your indexes set up appropriately.  Indexing on id, revision would be good. 
 Here's a different take on your query. Haven't checked its execution plan, but if you set up the index well it should help:

 If you're on SQL Server, you might want to check out Indexed Views as well:

 Editted again to add info: 
 
 I'd still go with the sub query. 
 
 Tested with one of our tables that has nearly 1 million rows total. Indexes exist on both fields FIELD2 AND FIELD3. Query returned 83953 rows in under 3 seconds on our dev box. 
 
 
 Analytics would be my recommendation. 
 
 
 Idea from left field, but what about adding an extra field to the table: 
 
 Then when you make a change, set the flag on the new revision and remove it on all previous ones. 
 Your query would then simply become: 
 
 This would be much easier on the database and therefore much faster. 
 
 One quite clean way to do "latest x by id" type queries is this. It should also be quite easy to index properly. 
 
 
 For big tables I find that this solution can has a better performance: 
 
 
 Without subselects (or temporary tables):
