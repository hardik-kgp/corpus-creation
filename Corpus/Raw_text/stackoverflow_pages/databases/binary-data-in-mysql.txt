 How do I store binary data in  MySQL ? 
 
 The answer by phpguy is correct but I think there is a lot of confusion in the  additional details there. 
 The basic answer is in a   data type / attribute domain.  **BLOB**
 is short for Binary Large Object and that column data type is specific for handling binary data. 
 See  the relevant manual page for MySQL . 
 
 For a table like this: 
 
 Here is a PHP example: 
 
 
 I strongly recommend  **against**
 storing binary data in a relational database. Relational databases are designed to work with fixed-size data; that's where their performance strength is: remember  Joel's old article  on why databases are so fast? because it takes exactly 1 pointer increment to move from a record to another record. If you add BLOB data of undefined and vastly varying size, you'll screw up performance.  
 Instead, store files in the file system, and store file names in your database.  
 
 While you haven't said what you're storing, and you may have a great reason for doing so, often the answer is 'as a filesystem reference' and the actual data is on the filesystem somewhere.

 It depends on the data you wish to store.  The above example uses the   data type, but you should be aware that there are other binary data formats: 
 
 
 
 Each has their use cases.  If it is a known (short) length (e.g. packed data) often times   or   will work.  They have the added benefit of being able ton index on them. 
 
 While it shouldn't be necessary, you could try   encoding data in and decoding it out. That means the db will just have ascii characters. It will take a bit more space and time, but any issue to do with the binary data will be eliminated. 
 
 If the -  not recommended  - BLOB field exists, you can save data this way: 
 
 Idea taken from  here . 
 
 The question also arises how to get the data into the BLOB. You can put the data in an INSERT statement, as the PHP example shows (although you should use  mysql_real_escape_string  instead of addslashes). If the file exists on the database server, you can also use MySQL's  LOAD_FILE 
 
 When I need to store binary data I always use   format, as introduced  . 
 You can find documentation at MySQL website under documented topic   12.4.2 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types 
 If you are asking what are advantagese, please look at question  why-varbinary-instead-of-varchar
