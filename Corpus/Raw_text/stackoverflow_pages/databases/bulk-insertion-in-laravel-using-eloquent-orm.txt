*** bulk-insertion-in-laravel-using-eloquent-orm ***

 How can we perform bulk database insertions in Laravel using Eloquent ORM? 
 I want to accomplish this in Laravel:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/10615821/600516 
but I am getting the following error. 
 
 SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: mixed named and positional parameters. 
 
 
 You can just use  . 
 For example: 
 
 
 We can update GTF answer to update timestamps easily 
 
 Update:
to simplify the date we can use carbon as @Pedro Moreira suggested  
 
 UPDATE2: for laravel 5 , use   instead of  
 
 
 To whoever is reading this, check out   method . 
 
 
 This is how you do it in more Eloquent way,  
 
 
 I searched many times for it, finally used custom   like below: 
 
 
  is the proper solution but it wont update the timestamps, so you can do something like below 
 
 The idea is to add created_at and updated_at on whole array before doing insert 
 
 For category relations insertion I came across the same problem and had no idea, except that in my eloquent model I used Self() to have an instance of the same class in foreach to record multiple saves and grabing ids. 
 
 without "$obj = new Self()" it only saves single record (when $obj was $this) 
 
 
  is my model name.
This will return "true" if insert successfully else "false". 
 
 Maybe a more Laravel way to solve this problem is to use a collection and loop it inserting with the model taking advantage of the timestamps. 
 
 EDIT: 
 Sorry for my misunderstanding. For bulk inserting this could help and maybe with this you can make good seeders and optimize them a bit. 
 
 
 Problem solved... Alter table for migrate
