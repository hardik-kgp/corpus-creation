*** business-and-log-data-separated-by-db-or-schema ***

 When building a monolith, you probably want to have log/technical data and business/operational data separated in some way. Assuming you only use one RDBMS DB instance, would you do data separation by having multiple databases in the DB instance, or one database with multiple database schemas? 
 
 It depends on how the availability and connectivity of your system is designed. What are the data that are stored in these Databases.If they are linked data, there they can be kept on single DB instance but if they are partially linked and can run partially if one system is down then it must be on different instances. 
 Detailed explanation:- 
 1) When you use one DB instance and in that you use multiple databases, then you are caught up with the issue that if your connection goes down(due to system crash or mysql server is down),all Databases as they are on same instance are also down, so all your applications are impacted. 
 2) When you separate DB instance for each Database,then if any one Database system is down,your other applications doesn't have impact.So other application can run only the application which depends on down DB is impacted. 
 Also,in both the cases i think you must also use replication mechanism so that load balancing can be done on slave Databases.
