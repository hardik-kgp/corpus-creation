 Is there any particular NoSQL database suitable for C#? 
 Thank you! 
 
 I agree with Marc's comment above, but I guess what you're looking for is probably something like  RavenDB .  It's developed specifically with .NET in mind, so would probably seem more "C# friendly" than others such as CouchDB or MongoDB, etc. 
 Keep in mind, however, that the different NoSQL implementations have different strengths and weaknesses beyond simply what language/platform is more natively considered during their development.  It may very well be true that RavenDB would seem more natural to a .NET developer, but a different database may be better suited to the job at hand depending on the data persistence needs. 
 Here's  a quick breakdown  of some other feature comparisons that I just found.  As you can see there's more to each tool than its .NET driver.  A little Googling of NoSQL database comparisons will yield more information.  If you have more specific data persistence needs or can elaborate more on the project in question we may be able to provide more advice. 
 **Edit:**
 (In response to your comment above)  To perhaps help you narrow down your choices, here's my experience so far: 
 Of the three that I've mentioned, the only one I've actually used in .NET is MongoDB.  It didn't "feel" as native for .NET purposes, but it wasn't difficult or unwieldy in any way.  It was easy enough to use and performed its intended task very well. 
 I've used CouchDB from JavaScript code, as opposed to from .NET code.  It's considered to be a very JavaScript friendly database and I've been toying with the idea of connecting to it directly from client-side AJAX calls.  But it should be just as easy from within .NET.  That's the beauty of a RESTful API, really.  Anything should be able to interact with it as easily as interacting with any service.  From within .NET code, something like RestSharp may make using CouchDB very easy and feel more .NET-native. 
 
 MSDN Magazine had a sequence of articles by Ted Steward on using MongoDB from C# around May-July 2010.

 Pure C# free and open-source NoSql  DBreeze database 
 
 Mongo recently released and is subsequently supporting a native C# driver. Source code is on Github. See here for more details:  http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/CSharp+Language+Center 
 
 EgoDB  is another one,simple, thread safe, multi-process  written in plain c#
