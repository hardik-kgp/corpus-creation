 SQL Server query to find all current database names   
 
 I am trying to figure out how to list the databases after connecting to the servers without specifying a database first.   
 
 So basically what i want is the end user to connect to the sql server, then have a drop down list populated with the list of db's they can connect and query. 
 Ideas? 
 
 You can use  : 
 
 SQL Server Schema Collections (ADO.NET) 
 
 To determine the list of supported schema collections, call the
  GetSchema method with no arguments, or with the schema collection name
  "MetaDataCollections". This will return a DataTable with a list of the
  supported schema collections, the number of restrictions that they
  each support, and the number of identifier parts that they use. 
 
 
 You can write a stored proc which can return you a list of databases on that server. 
 
 or 
 
 
 This should get you database names: 
 
 Feel free to exclude all the printing at the end.  Toss all that in a console app to see it in action.  The table names are in index 0 of  . 
 
 You can use SMO -  SQL Server Management Objects . 
 This is two sample code in code project: 
 SQL Server Authentication using SMO 
 Databases using SMO 
 
 The most up to date list of databases will be in the database itself. Why not connect to   as a default database (since you have to connect to something) to start with and then query from master.sys.databases. 
 
 Then you can update your connection string with whatever database is necessary or simply change the db using the   method.  
 e.g.  
 You could also connect to master, but I like to keep default connections in tempdb as occasionally people forget to change databases before creating objects. I would rather the junk go into tempdb than master since tempdb is recreated when SQL restarts.
