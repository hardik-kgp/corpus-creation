*** c-sharp-inserting-data-from-a-form-into-an-access-database ***

 I started learning about   and have become stuck with inserting information from textboxes into an   database when a click button is used. 
 The problem I get is during the adding process. The code executes the   part and then returns an error saying "Microsoft Access Database Engine" and doesn't give any clues. 
 Here is the code: 
 
 
  is a  reserved word .  Bracket that field name to avoid confusing the db engine. 
 
 
 This answer will help in case, If you are working with  **Data Bases**
 then mostly take the help of try-catch block statement, which will help and guide you with your code. Here i am showing you that how to insert some values in Data Base with a Button Click Event. 
 
 
 
 and doesnt give any clues 
 
 Yes it does, unfortunately your code is ignoring all of those clues.  Take a look at your exception handler: 
 
 All you're examining is the  source  of the exception.  Which, in this case, is "Microsoft Access Database Engine".  You're not examining the error message itself, or the stack trace, or any inner exception, or  anything useful about the exception . 
 Don't ignore the exception, it contains information about what went wrong and why. 
 There are various logging tools out there (NLog, log4net, etc.) which can help you log useful information about an exception.  Failing that, you should  at least  capture the exception message, stack trace, and any inner exception(s).  Currently you're  ignoring  the error, which is why you're not able to solve the error. 
 In your debugger, place a breakpoint inside the   block and examine the details of the exception.  You'll find it contains a lot of information.
