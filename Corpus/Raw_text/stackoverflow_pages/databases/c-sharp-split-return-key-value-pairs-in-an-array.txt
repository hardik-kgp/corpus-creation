*** c-sharp-split-return-key-value-pairs-in-an-array ***

 I'm new to C#, and thus am looking for layman's terms regarding this.  Essentially, what I would like to do is turn:   
 key1=val1|key2=val2|...|keyN=valN   
 into a database array where, you guessed it, key1 returns val1, key2 returns val2, etc.  I know I could return a string using split, but from that point on, I'm at a loss.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  I hope I've made my intentions clear, but if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! 
 
 
 Now   is a   with the desired key/value pairs.  
 
 
 Probably a Linq way of doing it.
