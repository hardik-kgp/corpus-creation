*** c-sharp-winforms-npgsql-3-0-5-an-operation-already-in-progress-error-when-tryi ***

 I'm trying to run the following snippet in C# Winforms. This piece of code is working well with pgsql 2.2.6 adapter. What correction can be made in order to work fine with pgsql3.0.5 adapter? Thanks. 
 
 So, at the second command statement it gives me the following error:  
 
 A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidOperationException'
  occurred in Npgsql.dll 
 Additional information: An operation is already in progress. 
 
 
 **EDIT**
 Additional info:
 
 
 You need to dispose of the NpgsqlDataReader which you get in the first ExecuteReader call: wrap it with a using statement just like you do with your NpgsqlCommand. 
 Disposing NpgsqlDataReader doesn't close the connection - only disposing the connection does that. An open reader corresponds to an open command currently running, which you must close before executing a new command. For atomicity, you can just start a transaction which encompasses several commands.
