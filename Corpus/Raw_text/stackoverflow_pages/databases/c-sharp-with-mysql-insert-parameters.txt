*** c-sharp-with-mysql-insert-parameters ***

 Good day to all, I'm using Visual C# 2010 and MySQL Version 5.1.48-community. I hope you can help me with this code. I don't find it working on me. What am I missing? 
 
 And when I try to compile it. It says: 
 
 Person column cannot be null 
 
 EDITED: 
 But when I try this code.  
 
 But this code is prone to sql injection attack but it works, doesn't gives me an error.  
 EDITED: 
 I tried to use this. I found it  here  so I thought It would work but gives me this error 
 
 Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than
  the size of the argument list. 
 
 Any idea? 
 
 Any help would be much appreciated. 
 EDITED:
 **SOLVED**

I used this code: 
 
 Thanks SO! 
 
 You may use   method like: 
 
 OR 
 Try with   instead of  , like: 
 
 Hope it helps... 
 
 Use the   method: 
 
 
 I had the same issue -- Finally tried the ? sigil instead of @, and it worked. 
 According to the docs: 
 
 Note.  Prior versions of the provider used the '@' symbol to mark parameters in SQL. This is incompatible with MySQL user variables, so the provider now uses the '?' symbol to locate parameters in SQL. To support older code, you can set 'old syntax=yes' on your connection string. If you do this, please be aware that an exception will not be throw if you fail to define a parameter that you intended to use in your SQL. 
 
 Really?  Why don't you just throw an exception if someone tries to use the so called old syntax?  A few hours down the drain for a 20 line program... 
 MySQL::MySQLCommand 
 
 I was facing very similar problem while trying to insert data using mysql-connector-net-5.1.7-noinstall and Visual Studio(2015) in Windows Form Application. I am not a C# guru. So, it takes around 2 hours to resolve everything.  
 The following code works lately: 
 
 
 Three things: use the   statement, use   and prefix parameters with ? and add   to the connection string. 
 
 Also see  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.parameters.aspx  for more information about the command usage, and  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-net-connection-options.html  for information about the Allow User Variables option ( **only supported in version 5.2.2 and above**
). 
 
 
 
 What I did is like this. 
 
 
 Try adjusting the code at "SqlDbType" to match your DB type if necessary and use this code: 
 
 or: 
 
 That should work but remember with Command.Parameters.Add(), you can define the specific SqlDbType and with Command.Parameters.AddWithValue(), it will try get the SqlDbType based on parameter value implicitly which can break sometimes if it can not implicitly convert the datatype. 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 try this it is working
