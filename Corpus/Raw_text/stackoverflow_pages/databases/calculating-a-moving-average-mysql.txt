 Good Day, 
 I am using the following code to calculate the 9 Day Moving average. 
 
 But it does not work because it first calculates all of the returned fields before the limit is called. In other words it will calculate all the closes before or equal to that date, and not just the last 9. 
 So I need to calculate the SUM from the returned select, rather than calculate it straight. 
 IE. Select the SUM from the SELECT... 
 Now how would I go about doing this and is it very costly or is there a better way?  
 
 Use something like 
 
 The inner query returns all filtered rows in   order, and then you  ,   up those rows returned. 
 The reason why the   given by you doesn't work is due to the fact that the   is calculated first and the   clause is applied after the   has already been calculated, giving you the   of all the rows present 
 
 If you want the moving average for each date, then try this: 
 
 It uses a correlated subquery to calculate the average of 9 values. 
 
 This query is fast: 
 
 If you need an average over 50 or 100 values, it's tedious to write, but 
worth the effort. The speed is close to the ordered select. 
 
 an other technique is to do a table: 
 
 After you can used it like that:
