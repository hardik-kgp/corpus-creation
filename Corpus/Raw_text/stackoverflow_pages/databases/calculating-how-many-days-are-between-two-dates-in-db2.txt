*** calculating-how-many-days-are-between-two-dates-in-db2 ***

 I need to get the difference in days between two dates in DB2. I tried a couple of different queries but nothing seems to be working. So basically what i need to get is something like this. 
 
 I know that if I remove CHDLM and specify a date like '2012-02-20' it works but I need to be able to run this against that field in the table. I also try this query that was given to me by a friend by is not working either. 
 
 Please any help will be greatly appreciate it. Thanks 
 
 I think that @Siva is on the right track (using  ), but the nested  s are making me dizzy.  Here's my take. 
Oh, there's no point in referencing  , as you need to pull from a table regardless. 
Also, don't use the implicit join syntax - it's considered an SQL Anti-pattern. 
 I'be wrapped the date conversion in a CTE for readability here, but there's nothing preventing you from doing it inline. 
 
 
 I faced the same problem in Derby IBM DB2 embedded database in a java desktop application, and after a day of searching I finally found how it's done :

 It seems like one closing brace is missing at  
 So your Query will be  
 
 
 Wouldn't it just be: 
 
 That should return the number of days between the two dates, if I understand how date arithmetic works in DB2 correctly. 
 If CHDLM isn't a date you'll have to convert it to one. According to IBM the DATE() function would not be sufficient for the yyyymmdd format, but it would work if you can format like this: yyyy-mm-dd.

 As it has been pointed out by X-Zero, this function returns only an estimate. This is true. For accurate results I would use the following to get the difference in days between two dates a and b:
