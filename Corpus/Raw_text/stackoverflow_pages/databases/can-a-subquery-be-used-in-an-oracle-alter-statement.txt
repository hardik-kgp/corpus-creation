*** can-a-subquery-be-used-in-an-oracle-alter-statement ***

 Given a table name and a column name, I'm trying to dynamically drop an Oracle constraint that I don't know the name of ahead of time.

 My first thought was to use a subquery, but that doesn't work and results in an ORA-02250 error: 
 
 So far, the only working solution I have is the following, but it feels unnecessarily complex: 
 
 Is there a way to do this with a subquery, as I originally intended?  If not, can anyone suggest a more concise way to do this? 
 
 You cannot.  SQL and DDL are basically two separated languages.  Your solution is correct. 
 
 To drop multiple check constraints...
