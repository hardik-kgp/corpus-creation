*** can-a-table-field-contain-a-hyphen ***

 I have a table in a MySQL table with a fieldname 'product', and want to rename it to 'ds-product'. 
 The CMS type system I am using uses the id of formfields as the name of the table field to insert into. 
 For most this works fine, but for a particular field it prepends 'ds-' to whatever ID I give it, so I must make the table field name match. 
 However, when trying to do a query I get the error that 
 Unknown column 'sales.ds' in 'field list' 
 Is there any way I can have a field called ds-product? 
 
 Yes, you can use punctuation, white space, international characters, and SQL reserved words if you use  delimited identifiers : 
 
 In MySQL, use the back-ticks.  In standard SQL, use double-quotes.   
 Or if you use MySQL you can set the   SQL mode : 
 
 
 Try putting brackets on the last part of your call on the table. in your case: 
 
 just make sure to put the brackets on the table name only. not on the whole database it is located 
 
 P.S. works on columns, too. 
 I'm using Microsoft SQL Server Management.
