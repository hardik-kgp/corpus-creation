*** can-activerecord-create-tables-outside-of-a-migration ***

 I am working on a non Rails web app, so no migrations script by default.  
 The Sequel ORM lets me create tables easily in a script: 
 
 Is there a way todo this with ActiveRecord outside of migrations? 
 
 My current understanding is no, all modifications data or schema have to be done through a migration. I have  a complete rakefile on github  which can be used to perform the migrations outside of Rails. 
 Alternatively if it is just an initialisation script the following could be used. 
 
 
 In Rails 4 at least (possibly earlier?), you can call  create table  directly on an   instance, using the same syntax as the migration. 
 You can get a connection for your database (assuming you have only one database) by calling  . So, the Ruby for your example would look like: 
 
 Note: If you already have a model defined, and it uses the same database as the one in which you want to create the table, you can grab a connection object from there instead. For one-off table creation in the console, I'll call   simply because it's less typing.
