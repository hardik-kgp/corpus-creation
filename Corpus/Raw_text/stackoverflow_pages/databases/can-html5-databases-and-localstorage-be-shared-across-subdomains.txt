*** can-html5-databases-and-localstorage-be-shared-across-subdomains ***

 I am attempting to share data across subdomains using Safari. I would like to use an HTML5 database (specifically  localStorage  as my data is nothing but key-value pairs). However, it seems as though data stored to  **domain.com**
 can not be accessed from  **sub.domain.com**
 (or vice versa). Is there any way to share a single database in this situation? 
 
 **Update 2016**

 This  library  from Zendesk worked for me.  
 Sample:  
 **Hub**

 
 Note the   for matching the end of the string. The regular expression in the above example will match origins such as  , but not  . 
 **Client**

 There is simple way to use cross-domain anything, just create simple page that will be included as proxy  **iframe**
 hosted on domain you try to access, send  **PostMessage**
 to that iframe and inside iframe you do your LocalStorage database manipulation. Here is a link to  article that do this with lcoalStorage . And here is  demo that send message to different page in subdomain  check the source code, it use iframe and PostMessage. 
 **EDIT**
: New  version of sysend.js library  (used by above demo) use BroadcastChannel if browser support it, but still it require Iframe. Recent version also simplify using of Cross-Origin messages, you have html of the iframe in repo, that you can use (or you can use simple html file with single script tag with the lib) and in parent you just need to call one function   where example.com need to have   file (you can also use your own filename and different path). 
 
 Google Chrome blocks localStoage access from an iFrame in another domain by default,unless 3rd party cookie is enabled and so does Safari on iPhone...the only solution seems to be opening the parent domain on a different domain and then sending to to the Child via window.postMessage but looks ugly and shifty on phones...
