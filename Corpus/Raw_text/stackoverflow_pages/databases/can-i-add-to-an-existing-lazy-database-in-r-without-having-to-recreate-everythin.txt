*** can-i-add-to-an-existing-lazy-database-in-r-without-having-to-recreate-everythin ***

 I created a database "mydb" that when run with lazyLoad("mydb") import in the workspace
the (big) data.frames X and Y. 
I created "mydb" putting X and Y in an environment   and using the command  
 Now I created a third data.frame Z (quite big as well). 
 How can I add it to "mydb" without having to recreate the lazy objects for X and Y as well? 
 
 You need to save your workspace and try adding Dataframe Z into environment and again run   **tools:::makeLazyLoadDB(e,"mydb")**
 , please find example below 
 
 You can see your three Data frames x,y,z.
