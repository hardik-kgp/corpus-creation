*** can-i-configure-grails-with-no-datasource ***

 I have a Grails app that loads its data from xml files and delivers rss feeds via rome. I don't have any domain classes and my app has no datasource. I don't want Grails to load an in memory hsql db when the application has no need for it. Deleting the DataSource.groovy file prevents me from launching the web app, it seems as though the datasource is required, but is there anything I can do if my application doesn't need a datasource? 
 
 The following steps work for a new app (Grails 1.1.1) to run without using a datasource: 
 
 For an existing app on at least version 1.1 (think that's when hibernate was made a plugin) you should be able to just uninstall-plugin and delete the DataSource.groovy file. 
 
 I was able to comment out the data source and get a default grails app to run. Comment out your production section in the same way I commented out the following code in datasource.groovy   
 
 I was also able to remove the hibernate plugin using "grails uninstall-plugin hibernate" and still have the default app run. I haven't done extensive testing with this but hopefully this works for you. 
 
 The in-memory database is very lightweight so you should stick with that if you don't need a real database.  
 
 This is a good guide:  http://digitalbreed.com/2011/using-grails-without-a-database 
 Remove Grailsâ€™ Hibernate plugin. 
 
 grails uninstall-plugin hibernate 
 Delete the datasource configuration file conf/DataSource.groovy 
 Explicitly declare services as non-transactional. The default is true and your class methods would be proxied, but without the Hibernate plugin there is no transaction manager and the deployment will fail. 
 class SomeService {
    static transactional = false
    // ...
} 
 Use command objects instead of domain objects, particularly if you need validation.
