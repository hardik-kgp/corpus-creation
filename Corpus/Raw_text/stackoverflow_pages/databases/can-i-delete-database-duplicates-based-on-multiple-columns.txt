*** can-i-delete-database-duplicates-based-on-multiple-columns ***

 I  asked this question a while back  to delete duplicate records based on a column.  The answer worked great: 
 
 I now have a simillar situation but the definition of duplicate record is based on multiple columns.  How can I alter this above SQL to identify duplicate records where a unique record is define as concatenated from Col1 + Col2 + Col3.  Would i just do something like this ?

 This shows the rows you want to delete: 
 
 And once you're happy that the above two sets are correct, the following will actually delete them: 
 
 Note that in all three queries, the first 6 lines are identical, and only the subsequent query after the CTE has changed. 
 
 Try this one.
I created a table  **tblA**
 with three columns. 
 
 And added some duplicate values. 
 
 If you replace the select with a delete in the statement below you will have your multiple column delete working.
