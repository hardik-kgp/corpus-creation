 (I've already seen the  H2 database In memory - Init schema via Spring/Hibernate  question; it is not applicable here.) 
 I'd like to know if there's a setting in H2 that will allow me to auto-create a schema upon connecting to it.  If it helps, I'm only interested in the in-memory case. 
 H2 supports various semicolon-separated modifiers at the end of the URL, but I didn't find one for automatically creating a schema.  Is there such a feature? 
 
 Yes, H2 supports  executing SQL statements when connecting . You could run a script, or just a statement or two: 
 
 Please note the double backslash ( ) is only required within Java. The backslash(es) before   within the   is required. 
 
 If you are using spring with application.yml the following will work for you  
 
 
 "By default, when an application calls   and the database specified in the URL does not yet exist, a new (empty) database is created."â€” H2 Database . 
 Addendum: @Thomas Mueller shows how to  Execute SQL on Connection , but I sometimes just create and populate in the code, as suggested below. 
 
 
 What Thomas has written is correct, in addition to that, if you want to initialize multiple schemas you can use the following. Note there is a   separating the two create statements.

 If you are using Spring Framework with   and having trouble to make the test find the SQL file on the   property, you can use the   notation. 
 For example, if you have a   SQL file on the  ,  just use :
