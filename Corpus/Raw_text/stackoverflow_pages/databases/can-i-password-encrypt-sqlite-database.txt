*** can-i-password-encrypt-sqlite-database ***

 I am using SQLite database version 3 with C# Windows application..
i want to encrypt the SQLite database file using password or any other encryption way in order to prevent clients to open it from program files folder. 
 i don't want any runtime encryption ways, i just want to make the database file show password field when a client try to open it from the program files .. thanks 
 **Edit**

 and if i encrypted it from code,the client can open it when the installation complete and db file transferred to the program files before opening the program to perform the encryption  isnt it? 
 
 I use SQLite version 3 works perfectly!
You have to do that: 
 
 
 thereafter if the user tries to open the database. will say protected by Admin or the database is encrypted or is not a database or corrupted file! 
 
 
 Found in this  **forum**
 an post indicating that .. 
 
 If you can/want to use some kind of extension for SQLite you can also try  **SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE)**
 or  **SQLite Crypt**

 But you can change/set a password for your database  **using SQLite.Data**
 as shown in  this article . 
 
 Try   as editor. 
For Database Type, choose   while connecting. 
 
 Unfortunately, password in SQlite file can be added or removed or changed only from code. For that you need   namespace which will give you methods as well as Adapters and connections stuff to do so. 
 
 You can use the built-in encryption of the   .net provider (System.Data.SQLite).
