*** can-phpstorm-dump-a-mysql-database-into-a-sql-file ***

 I know PhpStorm can connect to a database and work with it. Is it possible to export the database to a myDb.sql file with phpstorm? 
 
 As far as I know, you can export data from tables. Some types of database allows you to   of any node.

 No, in phpstorm there is no such option.  
 You only can export  single Tables  from the Database by clicking on ONE single Table (doesn't work if you mark more than one Table) and open Mouse-Menu (right mouseclick). There you choose "Save to File..." an Choose what you need (for example " SQL Insert Statements". 
 For having a good DB-Client to manage the whole Stuff, use DBeaver (Standalone Version), or MysqlWorkbench.
I preffer DBeaver. 
 
 As of this writing (2018.1), right clicking on a database gives you the option to "Dump with 'mysqldump'". 
 
 In the latest editions you can right click on a Database and dump to file. It exports to individual files per table.
