*** can-symfony2-generatedoctrineentity-generate-entity-with-one-to-many-relations ***

 I suppose the answer is no but I am asking to be sure. 
SensioGeneratorBundle contains a command to generate entities. Do you know if it can generate the mappings for a one2Many or Many2Many field? Is there any project that implements this? 
 The only example I found: 
 
 Many thanks 
 
 I know this is old... but this could help some people. 
 Here is a Symfony3 bundle that can generate Doctrine 2 associations, including a one-to-many relationship: 
 https://github.com/Remg/GeneratorBundle 
 
 **Associations**

 
 Handles all Doctrine2 association types (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany). 
 Handles unidirectional and bidirectional associations. 
 
 
 
 AFAIK the answer is no. I have already asked  a similar question   and it seems that there is no free tool that can do that. But if you want to pay :  http://www.orm-designer.com/   
 
 There is a workaround that makes the job perfectly, without any additional software or bundle to install. 
 You just have to edit the   from doctrine like described here : 
 Symfony2 Doctrine2 - generate One-To-Many annotation from existing database by doctrine:mapping:import
