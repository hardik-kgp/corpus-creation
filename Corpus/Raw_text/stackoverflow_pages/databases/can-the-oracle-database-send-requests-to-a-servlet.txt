*** can-the-oracle-database-send-requests-to-a-servlet ***

 Usually we are sending requests from the browser, however I'm wondering if a database can also do the same thing.
Let say I have a servlet on my server and an Oracle database. 
 Is it possible that by using the Schedule option, the database will be able to send requests to the servlet? 
 
 **Using **

 Yes, you can send HTTP requests from the Oracle database. Here's a nice blog post that summarises how you can do it using the   package :

 An example from the Oracle manual : 
 
 **Alternative using Oracle AQ**

 If you want some intermediary layer, you might also use Oracle AQ, which I personally find more powerful:

 Using Oracle AQ, you could for instance bypass the HTTP layer and access whatever the Servlet is calling internally, directly.
