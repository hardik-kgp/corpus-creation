*** can-we-have-the-table-name-as-option-in-mysql ***

 **I am very, very new to MYSQL.I tried to create a table named "option".**

 **My SQL Query is :**

 create table option(  
 id int not null primary key auto_increment, 
 choice varchar(30) 
 ) 
 **While executing this query it shows the following error**

 Error Code : 1064
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'option(
id int not null primary key auto_increment,
choice varchar(30)
)' at line 1
(0 ms taken) 
 **If I try with the table name as "choice" it is working.**

 **can we have the table name as "option" in mysql?**
  
 thanks 
 
 Pick a different name (one that isn't a reserved word in your RDBMS) and save yourself and whoever else might work on it many headaches.  
 
 If you want to have a table name Option, you should be able to, just remember that whenever you use the table in a query, you will have to encase it in ` symbols.  Like this. 
 
 The ` key on the top left of your keyboard, with the tilde. 
 
 option is a reserved word in Mysql.we can use a reserved word by using the word inside a single quotes. 
 
 Better you select the other tablename.Ohterwise maintaining our code will be difficult. 
 
 You can use SQL keywords as table names in MySQL if you escape them with back-quotes. 
 
 It's not normally a good idea to do so, though. 
 
 **option**
 is a  reserved word  in MySQL. Save yourself a world of pain and use  **choice**
 for your table name. 
 
 See the  MySQL documentation  on this.  You can do it as follows: 
 
 
 Yes you can definitely create a table named option but in every query you will have to use 
 
 instead of plain  . Better improvise a little and create a table named options to save from trouble. Restrain from using mysql reserved words as table name or column name or procedure names.
