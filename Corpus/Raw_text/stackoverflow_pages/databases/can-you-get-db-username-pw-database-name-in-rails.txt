*** can-you-get-db-username-pw-database-name-in-rails ***

 I'm writing a rake task that does some DB work outside of Rails/ActiveRecord. 
 Is there a way to get the DB connection info (host, username, password, DB name) for the current environment as defined in  ? 
 I'd like to get it so I can use it to connect like this... 
 
 
 From within rails you can create a configuration object and obtain the necessary information from it: 
 
 See the  documentation  for Rails::Configuration for details. 
 This just uses  YAML::load  to load the configuration from the database configuration file ( ) which you can use yourself to get the information from outside the rails environment: 
 
 
 Bryan's answer in the comment above deserves a little more exposure: 
 
 
 
 returns the connection configuration in a hash:  
 
 
 As   remarked in their comment: this solution accounts for merging the configuration from   and from the environment variable  . 
 
 I think this is the simplest solution. After some testing (in Rails 5.2 at least) this will resolve DATABASE_URL correctly. 
 
 
 Old question but this was one of my first stops in looking up how to do this so I figure this may help someone else. I normally have .my.cnf files in the home directory. So using the 'parseconfig' gem and some ERB syntax in my database.yml config file means I've got dynamic file that I can feel good about checking into source control and also simplify deployments (in my case). Also note the list of common sockets, this makes it easier to move my app to different operating systems that might have a different Unix socket path.
