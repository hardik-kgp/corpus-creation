*** cannot-be-cast-to-type-integer-error ***

 This is my first question so I will appreciate patience.  
 I changed a few attributes to IntegerField from CharField. Listed below is the code: 
 
 I did a south migration to migrate on Postgres and this is the error I get: 
 
 Any help will be much appreciated and thank you in advance!! 
 
 if you are happy to throw away your data, you can delete the column and create a new one  
 if you want to keep your data, you need to either 
 a) give your new column a different name, or 
b) create a temporary column to hold the data during the transition 
 you then need a sequence of migrations 
 
 a schema migration to add the new (or temp) column 
 a data migration that explicitly moves the data, doing any required conversion (e.g. "A" -> 1) 
 possibly a schema migration deleting your temporary column 
 
 
 You need to add "USING (col_name::integer)" to eliminate this error.
But in that case you have to use direct query. 
 migrateEngine.execute('ALTER TABLE test ALTER COLUMN testScore TYPE INTEGER USING testScore::integer')
