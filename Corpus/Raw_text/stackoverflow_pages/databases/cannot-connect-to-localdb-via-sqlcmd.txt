*** cannot-connect-to-localdb-via-sqlcmd ***

 I am currently learning SQL Server and am having problems connecting to my local database using  . 
 When I type in the following into Powershell: 
 
 I get the following error message: 
 
 Sqlcmd: Error: Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server : SQL Server Network Interfaces: The system cannot find the file specified. 
  Sqlcmd: Error: Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server : Login timeout expired. 
  Sqlcmd: Error: Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server : A network-related or instance-specific error has occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. Server is not found or not accessible. Check if instance name is correct and if SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. For more information see SQL Server Books Online. 
 
 I can connect to the local database if I use SQL Server Management Studio. I can also connect to the local database if I use the instance name pipe. 
 I have a clean install of Windows 10 x64, Visual Studio Community, and SQL Server Management Studio 2016. 
 
 There was a  driver bug  in ODBC Drive 13. Installing ODBC Driver 13.1 update will fix this. 
 You can  download the driver here . 
 Afterwards, you should be able to use in cmd or powershell: 
 
 
 I just got this error and  this article  solved the problem for me.  Start reading from where it says "Visual Studio 2017 & Pathing". 
 
 The error message actually occurs because my path variable is pointing to an older version of the sqlcmd tool....  The one that works for all of my SQL Express engines is at: 
 
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn\ 
 
 
 Using the sqlcmd in that directory worked for me.
