*** cannot-connect-to-mysql-with-127-0-0-1 ***

 With the following code I can connect to mysql:
 
 But if I change   to   I get the following error: 
 Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (13) 
 Why doesn't it work with 127.0.0.1? 
 
  is special cased and uses UNIX sockets instead of TCP/IP.   doesn't get that special handling. 
 See  the documentation : 
 
 On Unix, MySQL programs treat the host name localhost specially, in a way that is likely different from what you expect compared to other network-based programs. For connections to localhost, MySQL programs attempt to connect to the local server by using a Unix socket file. This occurs even if a --port or -P option is given to specify a port number. To ensure that the client makes a TCP/IP connection to the local server, use --host or -h to specify a host name value of 127.0.0.1, or the IP address or name of the local server. You can also specify the connection protocol explicitly, even for localhost, by using the --protocol=TCP option.  
 
 If it doesn't work when you use TCP/IP then the database probably isn't listening on the network. This is generally a good thing as it enhances security (not that listening on 127.0.0.1 exposes any problems, but listening on all interfaces gives more opportunity for attacks). 
 If you really want to allow connections via the network, then see  skip-networking . 
 
 have you got an entry in your hosts file mapping 127.0.0.7 to localhost? 
 
 Do you have more than 1 mysql servers installed/running on your system? If so, please specify the port number of the mysql server you are trying to access like 127.0.0.1:3306,127.0.0.1:8889 etc. 
 If you do not know whether there are any other mysql server instances running on your system also, please specify the port. 
 
 You will be able to access it when you add the privileges for   in the   table in the   database 
 
 You might also try disabling SELINUX
