 I put all my effort to solve this problem but there is no solution. On stack overflow in the following post link given: 
 How to connect to local instance of SQL Server 2008 Express 
 in one answer of this post I found this screen shoot   
 when I see my connect to server dialog box I find the difference like  
 
 What is the problem? 
 This SQL server runs on a single machine, not on a cluster or on a client server. 
 
 
 Go to services (services.msc) and restart the services in the image and then try to connect. 
 
 If you have  **Microsoft Windows 10**
: 
 
 Type  **Control Panel**
 on  Cortana  search bar (which is says by default ' **Type here to search**
'). 
 Click on  **Administrative Tools**

 Then click on  **Services**

 Scroll down and look for:  **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)**
, after that  right click 
 And then in the pop out windows click on  **Start**

 
 Now you should be able to connect to your  **pc-name\SQLEXPRESS**
  
 
 Initialize the SQL Server Browser Service. 
 
 Follow these steps then you solve your problem 100%. 
 
 When you get this error then close everything(Microsoft SQL Server Managment): 
 
 
 
 Then open command prompt by pressing (  +  ) keys and type   and click OK or press Enter key. 
 And search **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) as I show in the image. 
 
 
 
 Now see left upper side and click start. 
 If you open Microsoft SQL Server Management then you not get any type error. 
 
 Enjoy!!! 
 
 When you get this error. 
 Follow these steps then you solve your problem 
 
 Open command prompt by pressing (window + r) keys or Click on windows Button and Type Run then type  **services.msc**
 and click OK or press Enter key. 
 
 2.Find  **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)**
. 
 3.Now see left upper side and click start. 
 4.If Service show error then right click on SQL Express and then click on Properties. 
 5.Then click on Logon Tab. 
 6.Enter Username and Password of Windows Authentication 
 7.Then Start your Service 
 8.Problem will be solve and run your query 
 
 Use (LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB as the server name 
 
 I'm Running Windows 10 and this worked for me:  
 
 Open services by searching in the toolbar for Services. 
 Right click SQL Server (SQLEXPESS)  
 Go To Properties - Log On 
 Check Local System Account & Allow service to interact with desktop. 
 Apply and restart service.  
 I was then able to connect   
 
 
 try using IP instead of pc name. If the ip working, then it might be the name pipe is not enable. If it;s still not working then the login using windows might be disabled. 
 
 I had this problem.
So I put like this:
PC-NAME\SQLSERVER
Since the SQLSERVER the instance name that was set at installation. 
 Authentication: Windows Authentication 
 Connects !!! 
 
 go to services and start the ones related to SQL
