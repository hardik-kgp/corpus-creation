*** cannot-create-a-new-table-after-drop-schema-public ***

 Since I wanted to drop some tables and somebody suggested the below and I did it: 
 
 Then I got problem when creating a new database, such as: 
 
 You can see I got error   
 
 ERROR:  no schema has been selected to create in* 
 
 How can I restore the public schema? 
I suggest people never do "drop schema public cascade;" if we don't know how to restore. Can somebody help me out? 
 
 The error message pops up when none of the schemas in your   can be found. 
Either it is misconfigured. What do you get for this? 
 
 Or you deleted the   schema from your  **standard system database **
. You may have been connected to the  wrong database  when you ran  
 As the name suggests, this is the template for creating new databases. Therefore, every new database starts out without the (default) schema   now - while your default   probably has 'public' in it. 
 Just run (as superuser   or see  mgojohn's answer ): 
 
 in the database   (or any other database where you need it). 
 The advice with   to destroy all objects in it quickly is otherwise valid. 
 
 That advice can cause some trouble if you have an application user (like 'postgres') and run the DROP/CREATE commands as a different user.  This would happen if, for example, you're logged in as 'johndoe@localhost' and simply hit psql mydatabase.  If you do that, the new schema's owner will be johndoe, not 'postgres' and when your application comes along to create the tables it needs, it wont see the new schema. 
 To give ownership back to your application's user (assuming that user is 'postgres'), you can simply run (form the same psql prompt as your local user): 
 
 and you'll be all set.
