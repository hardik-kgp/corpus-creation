*** cannot-start-mongodb-system-error-1067-in-windows ***

 After setting up MongoDB service on Windows Server 2008 R2 this error was raised.  
 
 
 The error came from an unclean shutdown detected. 
 Please visit  http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/repair  for recovery instructions. 
 a few steps will fix it (as it's written in the link above): 
 1) remove the file  
 2) run  
 3) start the mongod service  
 
 I was facing the same issue and I closed the other command prompt which was opened with mongoDB.exe, and hence created a lock on that executable. Simply only closing that command prompt window worked fine. Thanks for the help. 
 
 If you are in the Windows. you should change the mongodb's config in the System disk.For example  
 1) I change  . 
 2) And I make the path  in   .Before this,you should remove previous.
 3) Finally , you can net the serve.  . 
 I hope it can help you .English is not very good ,please forgive me.

 I was having the problem of starting the the MongoDB. The logs are pretty descriptive and you can find suggestion from there. 
 There is a ' **d**
' folder that needs to be created within  **data**
 folder like 
 **data\d**
 which was missing.  
 This solved my problem.  
 
 Although, not an ideal solution, I ended up deleting all of the database files in   and was then able to successfully run the   service. Note, this will delete all of the data in the database. 
 
 Make sure you have at least 5 Gb available space on the drive of the database. For me, clearing that space enabled the ability to restart Mongodb.
