*** cant-connect-to-mysql-server-on-127-0-0-1-10061-2003 ***

 I know this question was asked a lot before but I tried some of the solutions which were given and nothing worked.. 
 I have downloaded  **MySQL Workbench 6.1 on my windows 7 x64**
 and now as I want to start and do a simple DB I set a new MySQL Connection and let it as default the Hostname, port and the username I just set the name of the connection. In the beginning it was showing down in the action output that Could not connect.Server may not be run and in the msg part it was written   but I thought I would be able to do a DB and test it Then I created simple DB and when I wanted to execute it I couldn't press the Bolt which execute the DB so I tried from Query and I pressed the 2nd option which is "Execute(All or Selection) to text" as I couldn't choose any other option and this error was shown  
 I am new in this I have used SQL*Plus for a while but it is not the same. 
 Thanks in advance. 
 
 Looks like the mysql server is not started. 
 Look to the  official documentation  of MySQL how you can start a service under windows. 
 
 Install the server as a service using this command:  C:> "C:\Program
  Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin\mysqld" --install 
 
 
 If you have already installed MySQL on a windows machine make sure it is running as a service.. You can do that by  
 Start --> services --> MySQL(ver) --> Right-Click --> Start 
 
 I was facing the same problem, but what I did not realise is that I did not have the MySQL Server installed. You must simply install the MySQL Server. 
 In order to install the MySQL server, you must run the "MySql Installer" and then press the "Add" button and then choose the "MySQL Server" in the tree. 
 After doing that, run you workbench again and you'll notice that there'll already be a connection configured. Hopefully you'll be able to create a new connection or as many connections as you want. 
 Best regards! 
 
 In Windows goto task-manager >"services" and check that "MySQL" is runing. If not 
Right click on it ->open services->MySQL-> startup type -> 'Automatic' -> apply and OK. this is for windows 10 MySql 5.7 
 
 **(Windows)**
 If you have already installed MySQL server 
 
 and still cannot connect, then the service did not start automatically. Just try 
 **Start > Search "services"**

 and scroll down until you see "MySQLXX", where the XX represents the MySQL Server version. If the Status isn't "Started", then 
 **Right Click > Start**

 If you are here you should be golden:
 
 
 I solved the problem as follows:  
 
 run MySQLInstanceConfig.exe  
 
 Follow to the end without changing anything. 
 
 
 Avoid using   in your my.cnf file, if you have any.

 maybe it has a different solution, but I fixed it by finding mysqld.exe and running following command in the console: 
 
 You should be able to see following result: 
 
 
 To re-iterate what Jens wrote in more current code, first open the Command Prompt with Administrator access by right-clicking the Command Prompt icon and select "Run as administrator."  Then cut and paste the following into the Command Prompt at the C:> directory level: 
 
 You may have to change the name of the folder depending on where MySQL is installed and what version it is. 
 
 In my case I had a previous mySQL server installation (with non-standard port), and I re-installed to a different directory & port. Then I got the same issue. To resolve, you click on home + add new connection. 
 If you need to know the port of your server, you can find it when you start My SQL command line client via All Programs -> MySQL ->  MySQL ServerX.Y  -> MySQL X.Y Command Line Client and run command status (as below) 
 
 
 
 Resolved this issue by navigating to C:\xampp\mysql\bin and double clicking on mysqld.exe and then allow access in the pop up that comes. My server status on workbench changed to running 
 
 Just in case anyone needs this. For me in my case, I had installed a new installation of MYSQL(8) and WORKBENCH etc. so that I could then work on an old Wordpress website. No matter what I did, it wouldn't work. Kept getting " **ERROR ESTABLISHING CONNECTION**
" etc. Thinking that it was maybe something to do with wordpress(since it is old), i tried a basic manual connection with php and nothing.  
 Eventually, I figured out that I had to downgrade MYSLQ. So i went back to MYSQL installer, found the server, and downgraded MYSQL from 8.0 back to 5.5 
 As soon as I did that, everything worked. Hope this helps 
 
 If you have already created a localhost connection and its still showing can not connect then goto taskbar and find the MySQL notifier icon. Click on that and check whether your connection name is running or stopped. If its stopped then start or restart. I was facing the same issue but it fixed my problem. 
 
 I encountered a similar problem. I am using WinNMP. When I started it, MariaDB was also not running and prompts "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (10061) (2003)" whenever I try to connect to a database. 
 Just want to help. For WinNMP users like me, this worked for me: 
 
 Run   installer located at  . 
 Restart your WinNMP. 
 MariaDB should be running now. 
 
 Hope this helps someone! :D
