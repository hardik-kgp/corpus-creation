 SQL statement: 
 
 This is the error I get 
 
 Creating [FTSearch]... 
  SQL72014: .Net SqlClient Data Provider: 
  Msg 9982, Level 16, State 100, Line 1 
  Cannot use full-text search in user instance. 
 
 I am using   that is installed along with visual studio 2012. 
 
  does not support fulltext index. I installed   and it worked like a charm. I had to create an entirely new database again though it wasn't really much of a problem for me as i just copy pasted all the DDL statements from the my previous database. Also i had to use   instead of   as the server name. 
 During installation if you want to save disk space then only install   and leave all the other features unchecked. 
 EDIT:
You can use your old databse. Copy the old database files to a new location preferably to something like  
and run the following sql statement.
