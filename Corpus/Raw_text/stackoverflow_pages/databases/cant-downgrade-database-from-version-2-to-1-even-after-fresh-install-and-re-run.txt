*** cant-downgrade-database-from-version-2-to-1-even-after-fresh-install-and-re-run ***

 I'm writing an android app using SQLite DB. 
 I had few experiments and changed the DB version from 1 to 2. 
 Then my DB schema became stable and because i didn't release the app and it's for my own use 
 I have decided to change the version to 1 again. 
 I did fresh install and everything worked fine. 
 But then running for the second time throws this error: 
 
 Why is that, after all I did fresh install and the DB should have been removed as well. No? 
 How can i change the version to 1 again? 
 
 This exception is thrown on the following conditions: 
 
 The device that you're running the code on has a database file of version 2. 
 The code is requesting version 1 of the database (with a param to   constructor) 
  is not overridden in your code. 
 
 You say the code worked fine the first time after a fresh install. Make sure there's no other code that would bump up the version number of the same database file to 2 again.  
 
 Had the same problem and I solved it like this. 
 
 
 You can override the   by your own if you want to be able to run your application with a database on the device with a higher version than your code can handle. 
 This is the default implementation of  : 
 
 If you need to override this method please read  this question also . 
 Without override that method, we cannot decrease the SQLite version after increased and executed. So you need to change back to   or greater than  : 
 
 **If you are trying to update your table,**
 probably need to pass   not   and each and every time you need to update the table, you need to  **increase the version(not decrease)**
. 
 
 This exception happens when the database needs to be downgraded, but your  SQLiteOpenHelper -derived class does not implement the  onDowngrade callback . 
 
 You don't show where the database is created, which is where the database version is normally assigned (i.e. SQLiteOpenHelper ctor). 
 Is there any chance you have the database on external file system?  Unless you follow the naming conventions, these files are not deleted when the application is removed. 
 
 How did you perform the fresh install? 
 
 ? In that case, the data of you app, including the database(s), won't be touched. 
  and  ? This would be the right way to perform a clean installation. All data will be removed during the   and your database will be freshly created after the first start after the  . 
 
 But you write that during the first start after the fresh install, it worked.
This can only mean that you somewhere still perform a upgrade to version 2. 
 
 **Update**
: 
Go to app info and > Storage and clear data should worke as well. 
 One possible reason it worked first time but not second time could be that the database wasn't called in the first run? 
 Also from Marshmallow, Android app data is  automatically backed up.  for apps targeting 23+ so your app could have gotten the previous database from the cloud without you knowing. 
 Unfortunately, you can't yet delete app data individually. But if you don't mind killing your backed up data for all apps, you can uninstall the app then go to  https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard  and expand the Android section and delete backed up app data. 
 After that, you should be able to re-install the app and get a fresh new database. 
 This worked for me, but do so at your own risk. 
 
 This means that there is already a previous file and you are trying to create another one with the same name, you can change the name of the database, or on the device you are emulating uninstall the application, and emulate it again. 
 
 onDowngrade() is not overridden in your code.
You should handle onDownGrade(). 
 
 download the sqlite db file from Android  **DeviceFileExplorer**
  
 [data/data/your package name/databases] 
open the file using ( **DB Browser for SQLite**
) 
goto  **Edit Pragmas**
 tab and downgrade the db version from  User version   
finally save the file and upload it to  **DeviceFileExplorer**
