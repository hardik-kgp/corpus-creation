*** cant-export-my-database-from-mysql-workbench ***

 Hey guys i am trying to export my database from mysql workbench but i get this on the export progress: 
 
 Running: mysqldump.exe
  --defaults-file="c:\users\user\appdata\local\temp\tmp2h91wa.cnf"  --user=root --host=localhost --protocol=tcp --port=3306 --default-character-set=utf8 --skip-triggers "mydb" mysqldump: Couldn't execute 'SELECT COLUMN_NAME, 
  JSON_EXTRACT(HISTOGRAM, '$."number-of-buckets-specified"') 
  FROM information_schema.COLUMN_STATISTICS                WHERE
  SCHEMA_NAME = 'mydb' AND TABLE_NAME = 'courses';': Unknown table
  'column_statistics' in information_schema (1109) 
 Operation failed with exitcode 2 20:55:09 Export of
  C:\Users\user\Documents\dumps\mydb.sql has finished with 1 errors 
 
 Do you have any idea what might going wrong? 
Thanks 
 
 In MySql Workbench version 8.0.13 do the following steps: 
 
 Go to Management/Data export 
 Choose the schema to export in the 'Tables to export' list 
 Click the 'Advanced Options...' button (top right) 
 Search for the option 'Other/column-statistics' 
 Set the value to 0 
 Click the 'Return' button (top right) 
 
 Now it should work. Unfortunately, you'll have to do that every time you start MySql Workbench. 
 
 Also ran into this problem.
Decided as follows:
In the Workbench menu, go to:  
 Edit - Preferences - Administration 
 In the field " Path to mysqldump Tool ", prescribe the path to  **mysqldump.exe**
, in my case " C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysqldump.exe ", click OK. 
 After that, the error no longer appeared. 
 
 I too had the same problem.. I am able to resolve this Issue by disabling the column-statistics in the advanced options of the MySQL Workbench Data Export. 
 1: Click on the advanced options:
   
 2: In the other section for the column-statistics remove TRUE and set it to 0 to disable it.
 
 Now Return and Export the Data.
Thank You  
 
 I had the same issue 5 minutes ago. 
 I fixed it by adding in my   command  . 
Do it and it should work. 
 In my case it's a phing task but you should get the idea. 
 
 
 Bug still in Workbench 8.0.16.  
 Fix: 
 You can edit wb_admin_export.py under modules in the workbench program directory. Search for "skip_column_statistics = True" (you will find a conditional, don't worry), comment that line and add a line "skip_column_statistics = True" (without a conditional).  
 The required parameter will now be always added. 
 
 I had the same problem and I solved it like this: 
 edit the workbench preferences:
Edit -> Preferences -> Administration 
 in the property "Path to mysqldump Tool" place the path of your mysqldump.exe
It is usually found in "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysqldump.exe" 
 
 It is due to a flag that is by default "enabled" in mysqldump 8.  
 That can be disabled by adding --column-statistics=0.  
 Syntax :  
 
 For more info please go to  link 
 To disable column statistics by default, you can add 
 
 to a MySQL config file, such as /etc/my.cnf or ~/.my.cnf. 
 
 Go to   and open this file   and uncomment " " then Restart the workbench 
 
 I found this condition in   instead of a commented  . you can remove the   condition, or change it to  .
