*** cant-import-database-through-phpmyadmin-file-size-too-large ***

 I have been trying to import Database through phpMyAdmin. My database file is   and it's size is 1.2 GB 
I am trying to import this on local and phpMyAdmin is saying: 
 
 You probably tried to upload too large file. Please refer to documentation for ways to workaround this limit. 
 
 Please help I really need this to work. 
 
 Its due to PHP that has a file size restriction for uploads.  
 If you have terminal/shell access then the above answers @Kyotoweb will work. 
 one way to get it done is that you create an .htaccess/ini file file to change PHP settings to get the sql file uploaded through PHPmyAdmin. 
 
 Note you should remove this file after upload. 
 
 For Upload large size data in using phpmyadmin
Do following steps. 
 
 Open php.ini file from C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.4.4\bin    Update
following lines    

   

than after restart wamp server or restart all services    Now Upload
data using import function in phymyadmin.    Apply second step if
till not upload data. 
 open config.default.php file in
c:\wamp\apps\phpmyadmin4.0.4\libraries    (Open this file accoring
to phpmyadmin version) 
Find  Replace to  
Now you can upload data. 
 
 You can also upload large size database using MySQL Console as below. 
 
 Click on WampServer Icon -> MySQL -> MySQL Consol 
 Enter your database password like   in popup 
 Select database name for insert data by writing command  
 Then load source sql file as  
 Press enter for insert data. 
 
 **Note**
: You can't load a compressed database file e.g.   or  , you have to extract it first. Otherwise the console will just crash. 
 
 Here is what I've done: 
 
 Gone to my XAMPP installed directoy  
 Open the "Configuration Settings" file named   using your text editor, preferably you can also you Notepad for Windows machine. 
 Somewhere nearby on line no 886, please update it to  
 Similarly on line no 735  
 On line no 442  
 On line no 452  
 Restart your Apache from either XAMPP Control Panel or using CMD in Windows  https://stackoverflow.com/a/6723485/969092 
 
 Done! 
 
 Use command line : 
 
 where MYDATABASE.sql is your sql file. 
 
 Another option that nobody here has mentioned yet is to do a staggered load of the database using a tool like  BigDump  to work around the limit. It's a simple PHP script that loads a chunk of the database at a time before restarting itself and moving on the the next chunk. 
 
 for ubuntu 14.04 use this: 
 1- open php.ini using gedit or nano: 
        sudo gedit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
 2- find 'upload_max_size' then replace this single line with these lines: 
        max_execution_time = 259200
        max_input_time = 259200
        memory_limit = 1000M
        upload_max_filesize = 750M
        post_max_size = 750M
 3- save php.ini and close editor 
 4- restart apache2: 
       sudo service apache2 restart
 5- now open  localhost://phpmyadmin/  in browser and uplaod your database.sql
     
 
 Set the below values in   file ( ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Open config.default file(C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\libraries\config.default) and set the value as below: 
 
 $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] = 0; 
 
 Then open the config.inc file(C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc). and paste below line: 
 
 
 
 Go to phpMyAdmin( ) folder and create folder called   and paste your database to newly created upload folder (don't need to zip) 
 Lastly, go to phpMyAdmin and upload your db (Please select your database in drop-down) 
 
 
 
 That's all baby ! :) 
 
 ***It takes lot of time.In my db(266mb) takes 50min to upload. So be patient ! ***

 
 You no need to edit   or any thing.
I suggest best thing as Just use  **MySQL WorkBench**
.  
 JUST FOLLOW THE STEPS. 
 Install MySQL WorkBench 6.0 
 And In "Navigation panel"(Left side) there is option call 'Data import' under "MANAGEMENT". Click that and [follow steps below] 
 
 click Import Self-Contained File and choose your SQL file 
 Go to My Document and create folder call  . 
 now you ready to upload file. Click IMPORT Button on down. 
 
 
 You can also try compressing (zipping) the file.  It sometimes works for me if I can't get to php.ini for phpmyadmin.  If zipping reduces the file size below the maximum file size, it just might work! 
 
 If you are using MySQL in Xampp then do the steps below. 
 Find the following in XAMPP control panel>Apach-Config> PHP (php.ini) file 
 
 post_max_size = 8M 
 upload_max_filesize = 2M  
 max_execution_time = 30  
 ut_time = 60  memory_limit = 8M 
 
 And change their sizes according to your need. 
I'm using these values 
 
 
 You have three options: 
 
 Use another way to get the file on the server, and use a mysql client on the server 
 Use another client to connect to the server and load the data 
 Change your PHP settings to allow such huge files. Don't forget to increment the execution time as well. 
 
 
 to import big database into phpmyadmin there are two ways 
1 increase file execution size from php.ini
2 use command line to import big database.
