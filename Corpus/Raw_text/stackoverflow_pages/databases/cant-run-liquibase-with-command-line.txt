*** cant-run-liquibase-with-command-line ***

 I want to use liquibase but when I want to let it run with command line this happens: 
 
 I have tried liquibase-3.6.1 and now liquibase-3.6.0 
 
 One of the required libraries is missing from the library folder. 
 See the bug report link below where another user had the same issue. 
 
 It appears 3.6.1 is still missing slf4j-api-1.7.25 in the lib folder
  and I still receive an error invoking liquibase via cli. 
 
 You have three options: 
 
 Get the library yourself  [here] .  
 Wait for the patched
version (Maybe submit a fix yourself). 
 Revert to an older version (3.5.5 Should work) 
 
 See here for the bug report:

 I stumbled upon the same issue in version  . The problem is that Liquibase can't find the required classes (  being just one of them, but there are others). There is no universal recipe, but the high-level idea is to found JARs the required classes live in and feed them to the   command-line parameter. Looks a bit ugly but this is what finally worked: 
 
 Please note that I use   on Linux while   will be required on Windows. Adjust the command according to your specific JAR location. 
 Alternatively, you can put dependencies to a directory and specify it with a wildcard after  : 
 
 
 You must add this libraries to your classpath: 
 
 logback-core 
 logback-clasic 
 
 In my case I am using Spring Boot liquibase integration, so, here is my   liquibase configutarion 
 
 It's an extract from  liquibase-gradle-plugin
