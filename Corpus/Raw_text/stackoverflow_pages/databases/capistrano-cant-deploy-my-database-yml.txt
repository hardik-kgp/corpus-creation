*** capistrano-cant-deploy-my-database-yml ***

 When I try to deploy my app with capistrano, I'll get this error:    
 
 failed: "sh -c 'cp
  /var/www/my_app/releases/20120313115055/config/database.staging.yml
  /var/www/my_app/releases/20120313115055/config/database.yml'" on
  IP_ADDR 
 
 My  **database.yml**
 ie empty,  **database.staging.yml**
: 
 
 in the  **/confing/deploy**
 are files "production" "staging" 
 What am I missing here/where should I look for a failure? The credentials to database on the server should be right. 
 **EDIT**
 - here is my deploy 
 
 The problem:  
 
 
 I'm not sure how to solve your problem. It looks like database.staging.yml is not being deployed, so there's nothing for it to copy over. 
 I think there's a better workflow, though. Things like settings and database configs do not typically change between deployments, so those things can go in the shared folder of all the capistrano releases. Typically, you don't want your database.yml to be in your repo either since it's sensitive information. You can satisfy both of these things by excluding   in your  . 
 This requires you to do a one time set up on your servers. You need create a   at  . Shared is a sibling to current and releases. 
 Your   should have a task that symlinks the newly deployed release's   to the on in the shared directory. Like this: 
 
 This means that your repo will contain no   files. Since they are probably already in your repo. You'll have to   them, commit. Add them to the   and commit that. 
 
 In Capistrano 3, linking files is built-in. John's answer is simply: 
 
 In the   folder create  
 In   use this line 
 
 
 This does what John was saying. 
 
 If you don't need to "reference application objects or methods"( 1 ) during precompile then you might be OK with setting   to   in
