 **Configuration:**

Integration tests for Rails project using RSpec, Capybara, Selemium driver, SQLite database. 
 **Situation:**

I had few integration tests with Capybara and default rack_test driver. They create a user registration (for Devise gem) directly in database. Then they login and test a scenario using Capybara DSL like a user would do. 
 **Problem:**

I tried to change a driver to Selenium to test JavaScript code as well. Now the tests fail because application does not see a user registration that the tests created. 
 **Investigation:**

 For me worked solution from  here  and  here : 
 
 add to Gemfile  
 create file   with content 
 
 ` 
 
 ` 
 though it caused small penalti to my contoller & model specs execution time (from 40 to 43 seconds).
