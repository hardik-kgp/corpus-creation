*** cascade-delete-on-two-foreign-key-constraints ***

 I have the following example: 
 
 I want to cascade a row on   if both   and   are deleted from their respective tables.  
 How can I make a row in Table C cascade itself when two foreign keys are deleted?  
 If only one of the FKs is deleted, the affected row should change to a null value in the column referencing that foreign key. 
 
 I suggest two  foreign key constraints with   and a trigger that takes care of the rest 
 Tables: 
 
 Trigger: 
 
 **SQL Fiddle.**

 
 Be sure to have a surrogate PK column for the connecting table.   cannot be the PK anyway, because that would disallow NULL in both. Add a   constraint  instead, which allows NULL values. 
 The trigger is optimized for performance and only kicks in when one of the two FK columns is updated, and only when that results in both being  . 
 The trigger function is trivial: deletes the row and returns NULL to cancel the now void cascaded  .
