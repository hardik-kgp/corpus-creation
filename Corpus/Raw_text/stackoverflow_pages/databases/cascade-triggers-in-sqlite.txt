*** cascade-triggers-in-sqlite ***

 I've the following DB structure in SQLite: 
 
 
 I want to create a trigger that whenever I delete a country all the related districts, municipalities and parishes are also deleted (like MySQL InnoDB), I've tried using SQLite triggers and came up with this: 
 **Districts:**

 
 **Municipalities:**

 
 **Parishes:**

 
 I haven't yet tested the   and   triggers because I get a strange behavior on the   trigger: when I delete a country  **only the first related district gets deleted**
, all the others related districts remain in the table. What am I doing wrong? 
 
 The trigger looks like it is deleting districts whose id equals id_countries, that is, the where clause is actually  
 
 You need to reference the id from the countries table. In a delete trigger, use "old" to do this. 
 
 Also, I would suggest changing your schema naming convention. Usually, the table name is singular, and corresponds to the entity in a row. I would have a country table with columns id and name, a district table with id, country_id and name, etc.  
 
 Then the trigger would be 
 
 
 
 This will enable the enforcement of foreign keys just like in MySQL. If you define your table with 'ON DELETE CASCADE' clause like so: 
 
 The whole row will be deleted when (in this case) it's parent user row is deleted. 
 P.S: I know this is a dead thread, but I figured I put this here for the people viewing in 2019. ;D
