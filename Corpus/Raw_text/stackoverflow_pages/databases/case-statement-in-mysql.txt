*** case-statement-in-mysql ***

 I have a database table called ' **tbl_transaction**
' with the following definition: 
 
 I would like to generate two columns:   and  . 
 Is it possible to populate the columns conditionally, using only a SQL Query, such that the output appears in the correct column, depending on whether it is an Expense item or an Income item? 
 For example: 
 
 I'm using MySQL as the database. I'm trying to use the CASE statement to accomplish this.  
 Cheers! 
 
 Yes, something like this: 
 
 
 As other answers have pointed out, MySQL also has the   function to do this using less verbose syntax.  I generally try to avoid this because it is a MySQL-specific extension to SQL that isn't generally supported elsewhere.    is standard SQL and is much more portable across different database engines, and I prefer to write portable queries as much as possible, only using engine-specific extensions when the portable alternative is  considerably  slower or less convenient. 
 
 MySQL also has  : 
 
 
 Try to use  
 
 
 This should work:  
 
 
 Another thing to keep in mind is there are two different CASEs with MySQL: one like what @cdhowie and others describe here (and documented here:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/control-flow-functions.html#operator_case ) and something which is called a CASE, but has completely different syntax and completely different function, documented here:  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/case.html 
 Invariably, I first use one when I want the other. 
 
 I hope this would provide you with the right solution:   
 Syntax:   
 
 Implementation: 
 
 Here I am using   statement as it is more flexible than  . It allows more than one branch. And   statement is standard SQL and works in most databases.
