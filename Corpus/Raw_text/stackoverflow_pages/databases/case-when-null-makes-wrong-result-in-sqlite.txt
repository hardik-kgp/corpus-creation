*** case-when-null-makes-wrong-result-in-sqlite ***

 I have a table with a column of image type, the table has some rows but all the rows haven't had any image yet, they are all null. To test the CASE WHEN NULL, I've tried this and it gave a strange result: 
 
 All the returned rows were in a column of 1's (I thought 0's). What is wrong here? 
 Your help would be highly appreciated! 
 Thank you!
