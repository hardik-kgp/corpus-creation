*** cassandra-frozen-keyword-meaning ***

 What's the meaning of the   keyword in Cassandra? 
 I'm trying to read this documentation page:  Using a user-defined type , but their explanation for the   keyword (which they use in their examples) is not clear enough for me: 
 
 To support future capabilities, a column definition of a user-defined
  or tuple type requires the frozen keyword. Cassandra serializes a
  frozen value having multiple components into a single value. For
  examples and usage information, see "Using a user-defined type",
  "Tuple type", and Collection type. 
 
 I haven't found any other definition or a clear explanation for that in the net. 
 
 **In Cassandra if you define UDT or Collection as frozen, you can't update UDT's or collection's individual item, you have to reinsert with full value.**

 
 A frozen value serializes multiple components into a single value. Non-frozen types allow updates to individual fields. Cassandra treats the value of a frozen type as a blob. The entire value must be overwritten.
