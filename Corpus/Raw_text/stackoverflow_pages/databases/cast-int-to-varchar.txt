*** cast-int-to-varchar ***

 I have below query and need to cast   to  
 **Schema**

 
 **What I tried**

 
 but they don't work. Please suggest. 
 
 You will need to   or   as a   datatype, there is no   datatype that you can cast/convert data to: 
 
 See the following SQL — in action — over at  SQL Fiddle : 
 
 Besides the fact that you were trying to convert to an incorrect datatype, the syntax that you were using for   was incorrect.  The   function uses the following where   is your column or value:

 Your original query had the syntax backwards. 
 
 You're getting that because   is not a valid type to cast into.  According to the MySQL docs ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/cast-functions.html#function_cast ) you can only cast to:  
 
 BINARY[(N)] 
 CHAR[(N)] 
 DATE 
 DATETIME 
 DECIMAL[(M[,D])] 
 SIGNED 
 [INTEGER] 
 TIME 
 UNSIGNED [INTEGER]

 short cut in mySql: 
 
 
 I don't have MySQL, but there are RDBMS (Postgres, among others) in which you can use the hack 
 
 The concatenate does an implicit conversion. 
 
 I solved a problem to comparing a integer Column x a   column with   
 
 
 use  :  
 
 
 I will be answering this in general terms, and very thankful to the above contributers. 
I am using MySQL on MySQL Workbench. I had a similar issue trying to concatenate a   and an   together using the   method.
In summary, what has worked for me is this: 
let's say your   is 'c' and   is 'i', so, the query becomes:
