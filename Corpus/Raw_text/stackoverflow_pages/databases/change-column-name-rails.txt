*** change-column-name-rails ***

 I have this table: 
 
 the 'season' column should be called 'season_id'. I know that I have to write 't.rename :season, :season_id' as explained in  http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#column-modifiers  but I don't manage to find the right syntax. Should it be? 
 
 Doesn't work. Anything I have to do in the Mac console? Thanks! 
 
 Run in your console: 
 
 Now file   contains following: 
 
 Modify it as follows: 
 
 Then run   in console. 
 
 Either fix your migration and do  
 
 or make another migration like so:  
 
 and then do  
 
 
 If your intention is to rename column in table than you example migration is not making sense :)... Instead of this 
 
 You just need table change migration, like this(Rails will take care rollback for your): 
 
  method on table object in rails is valid method, as you can see in Rails source code
