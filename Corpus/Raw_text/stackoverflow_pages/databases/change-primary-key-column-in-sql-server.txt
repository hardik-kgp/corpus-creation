 **END UPDATE**

 My host provides an interface to my SQL Server DB via ASP.NET Enterprise Manager.   
 I have 3 columns in my   table:  
 
  (key, int, NULL not allowed) 
  (key, string, NULL not allowed) 
  (not key, int, NULL allowed) 
 
 I want to make the id column the only key. 
 To do that, I believe I need to: 
 
 Make sure there are no NULLs in that column for any row 
 Set the column to not allow NULLs 
 Add the column as a primary key 
 Remove the other 2 columns as keys 
 
 However, when I use the UI provided, it never works. Sometimes it'll just look like it tries to do something but it never changes when I refresh the view of the columns. It occasionally creates a temp table that looks like it tried to do some of the operation, but that never gets copied/overwrites the original table that I'm trying to change. 
 When I try using a query, the changes don't show up either. Here are the queries I think I need: 
 
 I've only gotten to the attempt to disallow NULLs and to add the primary key for the id column. It doesn't seem to work. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks! 
 
 Assuming that your current primary key constraint is called pk_history, you can replace the following lines: 
 
 with these: 
 
 If you don't know what the name of the PK is, you can find it with the following query: 
 
 
 Necromancing. 
It looks you have just as good a schema to work with as me...
Here is how to do it correctly: 
 In this example, the table name is dbo.T_SYS_Language_Forms, and the column name is LANG_UID
