*** changing-table-engine-in-mysql ***

 I am using mysql and mysql workbench. I created 5 tables with innodb engine. I checked their engine and it was innodb before I insert data into them. I inserted data from 5 MyISAM tables and now my innodb tables are MyISAM. I can't change them. I used the alter table engine=innodb but it doesn't work. 
 
 From the manual:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html 
 For example, to convert a table to be an   table, use this statement: 
 
 The outcome of attempting to change a table's storage engine is affected by whether the desired storage engine is available and the setting of the   SQL mode, as described in  Section 5.1.7 , “Server SQL Modes”.

 When you create the table do you get any warning about the Engine type being unavailable? 
 
 It's not obvious. If you edit the table and then  **select the column tab**
 the engine widget is not immediately visible. On the upper right of the edit window you will see two down pointing chevrons.  **Select the arrow once**
 and additional widgets will appear. In the upper right hand corner  **there will now be widgets**
 for the schema and engine.
