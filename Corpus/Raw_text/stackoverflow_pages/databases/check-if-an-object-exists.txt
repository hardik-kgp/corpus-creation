*** check-if-an-object-exists ***

 I need to check if   turned up anything, but do not need to insert anything. My code so far is: 
 
 
 Since   returns a  , you can use  count  to check how many results were returned.  This is assuming you don't actually need the results. 
 
 After looking at the documentation though, it's better to just call len on your filter if you are planning on using the results later, as you'll only be making one sql query: 
 
 A count() call performs a SELECT COUNT(*) behind the scenes, so you should always use count() rather than loading all of the record into Python objects and calling len() on the result (unless you need to load the objects into memory anyway, in which case len() will be faster). 
 
 
 
 I think the easiest from a logical and efficiency point of view is using the queryset's  **exists()**
 function, documented here: 
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.exists 
 So in your example above I would simply write: 
 
 
 the boolean value of an empty QuerySet is also False, so you could also just do... 
 
 
 You can also use  get_object_or_404() , it will raise a   if the object wasn't found: 
 
 
 You can use: 
 
 
 if user exist you can get user in user_object else user_object will be none.
