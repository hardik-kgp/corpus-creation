*** check-if-role-exists-in-db ***

 I want to add users to the same role in more than one database. However the role may or may not be present in each database. How can I check if the role exists in each database and if it does, add users to that role? 
 e.g.
IF role exists
BEGIN
    Add user in role
END 
 
 try: 
 
 
 
 
 I can't comment yet, so I have to add this as an answer. 
 I like to be as specific as possible, which is why I prefer including the principal type. This is why I up voted Aaron's answer. 
 Using DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_ID could give unexpected results if there is another principal type with the same name as the role that you want to add. This is because DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_ID returns the ID number of a  **principal**
 in the current database, not specifically for a principal with a type of database role. 
 Let's say that you have a user with the same name as the database role. The status of Yada's script would indicate success, but it would not add the role because there is already a  **principal**
 with that name. However, Aaron's script would return the following error: 
 
 User, group, or role 'name' already exists in the current database. 
 
 I'd rather catch this issue early on (e.g. when the script is run) than later on (e.g. when my app is being used). 
 Here's what I'd normally use: 
 
 If I really want to handle this scenario and not show an error, I could use something like this: 
 
 
 To specify the database that you would create the role in it you need to use  
 
 then you could continue Yada's the answer and it will be like this
