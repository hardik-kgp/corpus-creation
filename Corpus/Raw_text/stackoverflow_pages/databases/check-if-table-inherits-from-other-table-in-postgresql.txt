 How can I  **programmatically check**
 whether one of these  **tables inherits from another table**
 or not? (Think information_schema, pg_catalog, ...)

 There is a catalog table for that:  . 
 
 The catalog   records information about table inheritance

 This is helpful as you can test in both directions with one query.
