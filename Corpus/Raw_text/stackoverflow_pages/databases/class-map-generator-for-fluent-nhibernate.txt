*** class-map-generator-for-fluent-nhibernate ***

 Is there a Class Map generator for Fluent NHibernate? I need something like db2hbm but I want it to generate Fluent Class Maps instead of xml mappings.  
 I am aware of AutoMapping for Fluent but that is not what I want. I want to be able to generate Class Map  **files**
 from tables in database and push them to my src repository.  
 
 You can do this with  NHibernate Mapping Generator . 
 
 You can do this with  Visual NHibernate . Check the Fluent Nhibernate option on the Options screen to create FNH mapping code. 
 
 LLBLGen Pro  is a great tool that can do this and much more. It´s not free, but it´s worth every cent. 
 
 This is the closest thing I've come across (T4 Templates example to generate Fluent NH mappings):
