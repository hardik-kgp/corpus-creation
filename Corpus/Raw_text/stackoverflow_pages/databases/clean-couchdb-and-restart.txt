 What is command to clean   please ? And if I want to   and   my CouchDB what is command?  
 Thanks 
 
 CouchDB can be started/stopped/restarted from the   or   startup script. 
 (This startup script file might be located somewhere else on your system.) 
 You would do something like this: 
 
 To stop:  
 To restart:  
 
 As far as cleaning goes, I think you mean compaction.  This is easiest to do via Futon, which is located here by default:  
 Login to Futon as an admin, navigate to your database, and there will be links to compact the database. 
 
 You can restart CouchDb as per the documentation  here 
 Example with curl: 
 
 
 This can be somewhat dependent on OS and its version. On Ubuntu 14.04, for example (which is transitioning away from sysvinit),  /etc/init.d/couchdb  commands don't work for me. I have to do: 
 
 So use the curl method posted by user2744667 (with root/admin privileges),  **or**
 use the standard method for restarting daemons/services for your OS. 
 Finally, as a last resort, you could kill the process. This is not the recommended way to do it, and it is not "clean" as you indicated in the question. You will likely find that CouchDB is agressive about respawning itself. But if you are in a homicidal mood, all that  kill -ing could be just the thing. 
 
 On Windows, you don't need to run a GUI like   ... Typing this is usually faster: 
 
 
 on Windows, if you installed it as a service, open  , find the   service, and restart.
