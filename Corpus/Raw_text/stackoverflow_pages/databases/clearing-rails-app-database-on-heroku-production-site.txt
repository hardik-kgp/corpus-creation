*** clearing-rails-app-database-on-heroku-production-site ***

 So I'm new to ROR and Heroku and need a little help. I've created an app and have deployed it; however, I'd like to clear out the database associated with it. Meaning I'd like to clear any users (and their attached data) that have been created thus far. 
 I've basically created several phony accounts to test out whether the database on the production site works, but now i'd like to clear this out, and start with a fresh database. 
 Is this possible without deleting the database entirely? 
 Any help would be sincerely appreciated. Thank you very much for your time! 
 
 You can use   command to reset the entire database. The command will simply drop and create the database. 
 You have to use   to create the tables then. 
 Alternatively you can use   command locally and then run   to update the production db. 
 
 
 
 Login on Heroku through terminal and then
run one of following commands: 
 
 The first one is an old one and the second is latest. 
 
 The  2013 way to do this  is: 
 Enter   in your console and then enter in your app name when prompted. This will drop the entire database -- tables, rows, columns, all of its data, everything. 
 Then, enter  . This will create the same table, rows, and columns, but without any object data. 
 
 The current way is: 
 
 
 The current Cedar stack's proper syntax for shared databases is: 
 
 (Replace "my-database-name-1294" with whatever is before the .herokuapp.com in your URL) 
 It'll then ask you this: 
 
 Just retype "my-database-name-1294" there and it'll reset everything. 
 
 To reset your database 
 run like bellow 
 
 heroku pg:reset SHARED_DATABASE --confirm APP_NAME 
 
 this works very well for my 
 
 Yes, you can either use SQL methods to do it or perhaps just use the Rails Console to do it from the command line and call the @users.destroy_all method.  This article  explains how to use the console from Heroku. 
 
 If you have two servers - production and staging, and you want to add the database from production to staging 
 
 **URL_TO_DATABASE**
 - an aws or dropbox url for the dump. 
 This worked for me! 
 
 Heroku provides a visual tool to do this.
Go to Resources > Heroku Postgres :: Database
Drop database manualy 
 If you want to migrate your tables use

 Databases can be reset from the web dashboard as well: 
 Find your database and click on the link:
 
 On the database page click on "Settings"
 
 Then click on, "Reset Database" and follow the instructions to confirm.
 
 You'll of course need to use rake to migrate to get your tables back.
