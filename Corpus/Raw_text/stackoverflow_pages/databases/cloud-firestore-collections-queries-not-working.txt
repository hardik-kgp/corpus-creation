*** cloud-firestore-collections-queries-not-working ***

 As Cloud Firestore is new, I am having problems using it.  
 I have to get  **Collection**
 of all  **users**
 and traverse it. But it is not working.  
 
 It says: 
 
 querySnapshot.data is not a function 
 
 And following code: 
 
 Is always printing  
 
 923052273575 Do Not Exist In DB 
 
 Even if it exists, See following image for reference.  
   
 
 I think you have some things confused as querySnapshot doesn't have  , but it does have   which have data.  
 In your first example, you are asking it to return all documents in the collection. You'll want something like this instead: 
 
 Key difference is looping over the docs in   and console logging the data from each doc. 
 For your second example, you'll want to check if the   is empty, rather than checking if it exists.
