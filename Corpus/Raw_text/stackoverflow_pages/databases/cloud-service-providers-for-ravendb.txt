 Not to be confused with  Shared hosting providers supporting RavenDB  or other similar questions. I do not need a web host, nor want to deploy RavenDb in  Embedded  or  Web Site  mode... 
 **Question:**
 Are there any cloud service providers for RavenDB, like  MongoHQ  and  MongoLab  for the MongoDB platform? 
 **Edit:**
  RavenHQ  and  Cloudbird  are two providers, but they are not in production - answers should only include those that are currently available. 
 
 After a lot of searching, conversations with RavenDB folks on Jabbr.net and speaking to some provider companies we have a answer: 
 RavenHQ.com  and  Cloudbird.net  provide such services. RavenHQ is ready for production and in the US East zone, while Cloudbird is in beta and in the EU West zone. 
 
 http://www.ravenhq.com  should be live any day as Ayende mentioned in the latest RavenDb videos on tekpub 
 **UPDATE**

 RavenHq is now live on AppHarbor

 http://www.cloudbird.net/  I've seen this mentioned but same as  http://www.ravenhq.com/  they don't give much detail. I also don't know who the authors of cloudbird are. 
 Otherwise, you could just use an EC2/Azure to host it? (I've seen Azure and RavenDB talked about on Twitter, there is some github projects with instructions)
