*** codeigniter-allowed-memory-size-exhausted-while-processing-large-files ***

 I'm posting this in case someone else is looking for the same solution, seeing as I just wasted two days on this bullshit. 
 I have a cron job that updates the database using a very large file once a day, using the following code: 
 
 This is in a Codeigniter controller that's only used for cron jobs. The $this->regen function runs through a bunch of different checks and stores the right information from the line in the database. The file itself is over 300MB of JSONs separated by newlines. 
 **The problem:**
 it would only process about 20,000 lines before the whole thing ran out of memory. 
 
 I spent hours troubleshooting this and got nothing obvious. I'm using fgets, I have $query->free_result() in the right places. It didn't help. So then I started checking a loop of about 100 lines, and watched the output of memory_get_usage(). I finally narrowed it down to the Codeigniter Active Record class - every call to the class caused the memory usage to increase by a tiny amount. 
 Then I found this thread on  Ellislabs  and I got the answer. CI Active Record saves queries so that if you want to, you can build a query in multiple functions. (I am not even going to go into how dumb it is to have that switched on by default.) 
 Go to /config/database.php and add  
 
 to the end of the file. Then make sure you build and execute queries using Active Record in a single function. If you need to switch it off just for one case, use  
 
 in the constructor or wherever you need to put it.
