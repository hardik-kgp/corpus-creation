*** codeigniter-multiple-database-connections ***

 I have to retrieve a MySQL database information from master database and then connect to that database, and fetch some records. 
 I mean that holding one database I want to load another database. 
 Is it possible with Codeigniter? Right now I'm using following lines of code in my model. 
 
 its not working is there any other way? 
 
 You should provide the second database information in `application/config/database.php´ 
 Normally, you would set the   database group, like so: 
 
 Notice that the login information and settings are provided in the array named  . 
 You can then add another database in a new array - let's call it 'otherdb'. 
 
 Now, to actually use the second database, you have to send the connection to another variabel that you can use in your model: 
 
 That should do it.
The documentation for connecting to multiple databases can be found here:  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/connecting.html 
 
 The best way is to use different database groups. If you want to keep using the master database as usual ($this->db) just turn off  **persistent connexion**
 configuration option to your secondary database(s). Only master database should work with persistent connexion : 
 Master database 
 
 Secondary database (notice pconnect is set to false) 
 
 Then you can use secondary databases as  **database objects**
 while using master database as usual : 
 
 
 Use this. 
 
 Usage 
 
 
 **It works fine for me...**

 
 This is default database : 
 
 
 
 Add another database at the bottom of database.php file 
 
 
 
 In autoload.php config file 
 
 
 
 The default database is worked fine by autoload the database library
  but second database load and connect by using constructor in model and
  controller... 
 
 
 
 While looking at your code, the only thing I see wrong, is when you try to load the second database: 
 
 When you want to retrieve the database object, you have to pass  **TRUE**
 in the second argument. 
 From the  Codeigniter User Guide : 
 
 By setting the second parameter to TRUE (boolean) the function will
  return the database object. 
 
 So, your code should instead be: 
 
 That will make it work. 
 
 
 Note: Change the words “group_one” and “group_two” to the specific group names you are connecting to (or you can pass the connection values as indicated above). 
 By setting the second parameter to TRUE (boolean) the function will return the database object.
