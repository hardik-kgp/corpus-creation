*** codeigniter-multiple-databases-accessing-database-config-in-a-second-database ***

 I've been looking into using multiple databases with CodeIgniter. If I know what the databases are ahead of time, then I can set the information in the config file and then call whichever database group I need.  
 In my situation, however, I need to store that database information in another database. It is sort of a master database with general information about a customer including the database and credentials that the customer's data is stored in. This vendor can then add customers whenever they want and have each customer's data segregated in different databases.  
 How can I set the database and credentials based on the values I get back from the master database in CodeIgniter, or is there even a way to do that?  
 Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance for any advice. 
 
 From the docs (  https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/connecting.html  ) : 
 
 The first parameter of this function can optionally be used to specify
  a particular database group from your config file,  **or you can even
  submit connection values for a database that is not specified in your
  config file**
. 
 
 So you would do something like this, replacing the values with values from the  **master**
 database: 
 
 If you need to maintain a connection to the  **master**
 database and the  **customer**
 database, then change the last line to: 
 
 
 Make the master a default database and the customer for second database 
        $active_group = 'default';
        $active_record = TRUE; 
 
 you can load the second database in controller or in model by 
 
 
 /** config/database.php **/ 
 
 /** Your controller or model **/ 
 
 NOTE: For more details, refer  Config Class Codeigniter documentation   
 
 Add below line in application\config\database.php 
 
 Now we use our second database in our Controller and model like below. 
 
 I have taken reference from  http://www.tutsway.com/use-multiple-db-connections-in-codeigniter.php  .It's work for me.
