*** codeigniter-using-ms-access-database ***

 So I using access database(*mdb).
This my code and success to connect: 
 
 And now I want to using accessdb from other computer.
This accessdb(*mdb) has been shared and I make map network drive(Z:). 
 So I was change hostname and database but its failed: 
 
 And I try this to: 
 
 But it still error: 
 
 and even i try to connect with php
and this is the result  php using msaccess 
 
 The problem is that the default IIS IUSER cannot access files over a network share.
the workaround is detailed here:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/207671 . 
 I would highly recommend using SQL Server (Express Edition if nothing else) than an access file - you will get a much improved experience + you will be able to migrate easier as the site expands if needed. 
 
 I found this thread for a similar problem:  http://ellislab.com/forums/viewthread/93160/ . Says you should try loading loading the odbc driver manually from your controller: 
 
 It also says that for some reason the database config is not available in the odbc driver: 
 
 system/database/drivers/odbc/odbc_driver.php 
 
 So you may also have to go in there and load the database config manually.

 Have you checked read/write access to that file? If your php app is running on IIS, then your IIS' user account will need to have read/write permissions to that file, not the user account you use to login to your computer. 
 
 Check what user your PHP program is running under. List a directory content with PHP to check. Consider that user running your PHP can also has no mapping of   you made under you own username. 
 
 After many searches (nothing from the mentioned solution worked) I found a different solution, on some ms Access db's you can only connect using double slashes in the connection string (not in the database path): 
 
 not sure what is the cause because I was able to connect on some Access db's (same server, same folder, same Access version) using single slashes and double slashes didn't work, think it's a silly joke of the same guy who worked on IE :-( 
 
 this works:
