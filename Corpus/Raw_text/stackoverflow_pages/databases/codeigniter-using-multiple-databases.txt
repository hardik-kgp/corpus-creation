*** codeigniter-using-multiple-databases ***

 **database.php**
: 
 
 The issue is I can only define in the configuration one 
 , default, or stats. I followed the CodeIgniter documentation and I added the following: 
 
 This way I connect to the second database, but I lose the connection to the first one. Does anyone have any ideas on how can I load the two database without having to do the following in all models constructors?

 Instead of applying the hack as mentioned by Camacho you can also set the 'pconnect'-flag in the database.php file to FALSE for all connections. 
 
 There is a bug in codeigniter.  Inserting one line into a class will fix the whole thing.  Here is the original source:   http://koorb.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/codeigniter-connect-to-multiple-databases/ 
 ** This fix does not apply to PostgreSQL 
 Here is a copy just in case that site goes down. 
 The line number has changed. Here is the bug fix from codeigniter: 

start bugfix

 Description 
 all of the database calls go to the same database (last one initialized) 
 To fix the problem change the simple_query function in /system/database/DB_driver.php: 
 
 This completely fixes the problem, so you can do stuff like this in a model 
 
 
 currently, codeigniter cannot connect to multiple database in persisten connection.
so, you should turn of the persisten of your connections.
you may can do this.. 
 
 
 I fix the problem changing the DB_driver.php on the framework. 
 In this function I add   and you never lose your connection again when working with 2 databases. 
 
 
 You may try modifying function CI_Session() in session.php file.  
 Replace  
 
 with this 
 
 In this way, you need not load 2 dbs in all the model files but shall use them directly using objects.  
 **$this->db1**
 would be accessing default group db and  **$this->db2**
 would be accessing db2 group db. (both db groups should have been defined in database.php)

 You donâ€™t need to create separate database configurations if you only need to use a different database on the same connection. You can switch to a different database when you need to, like this: 
 
 $this->db->db_select($database2_name);
