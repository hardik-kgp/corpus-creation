*** combining-union-all-and-order-by-in-firebird ***

 This is my first attempt at answering my own question, since someone may well run into this and so it might be of help. Using Firebird, I want to combine the results of two queries using UNION ALL, then sort the resulting output on a given column. Something like: 
 
 The parentheses came from valid syntax for other databases, and are needed to make sure the arguments to UNION ALL (an operation that's defined to work on tables - i.e. an  unordered  set of records) don't try to be ordered individually. However I couldn't get this syntax to work in Firebird - how can it be done? 
 
 
 
 Field names are not required to be equal. That's why you can't use the field name in the order by. 
You may use the field index instead. As in: 
 
 
 How about: 
 
 At least in the newer Firebird Versions it works if you order by "Number" instead of using an Alias. 
 
 In Firebird 1.5 this works for me 
 
 and then 
 
 
 Perform the UNION ALL in a view (without the ORDER BY clause), then select from the view using ORDER BY. 
 
 Moving   into a query tail has  **no**
 effect to output datagrid.
