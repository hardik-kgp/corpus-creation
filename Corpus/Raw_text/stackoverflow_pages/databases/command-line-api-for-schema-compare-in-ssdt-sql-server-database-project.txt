*** command-line-api-for-schema-compare-in-ssdt-sql-server-database-project ***

 In Visual Studio 2012, we have   in  SSDT 's   (DbProject) project which helps 
 
 Compare   versus    
 Update   to make it the same as  
 
 Where 
 
 Source and target can be either a database, a DbProject project, or a .dacpac file 
 Update can be done via an  **update action**
 or  **generated script**

 
 My question is that is it possible to have and where can I get the command-line/API interface to call this feature? 
 
 **SOURCE Database**

 
 **TARGET Database**

 
 **COMPARE & GENERATE the Delta script**

 
 **EXECUTE the script**

 
 I do this in CMD scripting as our IT dept will not allow unsigned PowerShell scripts and they won't purchase a cert. This works flawlessly, even when calling it from TFS 2012 Team Builds or simply executing the .CMD script from a VS command prompt as Administrator. 
 **Note!**

 Add the following SET in your script:  
 Also: as you can see I set path variables. I do this as I am touching up to 50 flavors of the database and this is the only consistent way I have found to generate delta scripts and update our DEV and TEST databases. 
 
 have you looked at  SqlPackage ? 
 
 At present, the only way to get API access to schema compare results is by writing a deployment plan modifier/executor that runs during a deploy/script operation in the DacServices API. This lets you examine the deployment plan generated when comparing a dacpac against a database, but it also gives access to the  ModelComparisonResult  that represents a schema compare operation, which is available in the context object passed to the  OnExecute  method of a contributor. I've just written a  blog post  that covers this process and might be useful to you - take a look at that and hopefully it'll help you get started. 
 
 I  wrote a few lines  on this topic a while ago. Hopefully you find them useful. 
 In a nutshell, the tool you are looking for is  , which is distributed by Ultimate and Premium versions of Visual Studio.
