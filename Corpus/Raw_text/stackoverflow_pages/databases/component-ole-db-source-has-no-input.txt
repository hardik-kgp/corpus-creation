*** component-ole-db-source-has-no-input ***

 I am new at doing SQL server data tools on VS 2010. However what I try do is: 
 
 I have created a textfile and imported it as a flatfile 
 I try to connect the flat file (with the green arrow) with a OLE DB but get the error:  
 
 
 Component OLE DB source has no inputs, or all of its inputs are
  already connected to other outputs. You may be able to edit the
  component to add new inputs to it. 
 
 Why do I get this error? 
 When I open the flat file a have diffrent rows and data in it, so there actually exists data :/ 
 
 you need to connect to an OLE DB  **Destination**
 not source
