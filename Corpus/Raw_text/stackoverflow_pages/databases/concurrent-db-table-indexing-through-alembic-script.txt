*** concurrent-db-table-indexing-through-alembic-script ***

 Is it possible to create concurrent indexes for DB table through alembic script? 
 I'm using postgres DB, and able to create concurrent table indexes through sql command on postgres prompt.(create index concurrently on  ();)  
 But couldn't find way to create same through Db migration(alembic) script. If we create normal index(not concurrent) , it'll lock DB table so can't perform any query in parallel. So just want to know how to create concurrent index through alembic(DB migration) script  
 
 I'm not using Postgres and I am not able to test it, but it should be possible.
According to: 
 http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/postgresql.html 
 Concurrent indexes are allowed in the Postgres dialect from version 0.9.9.
However, a migration script like this should work with older versions (direct SQL creation): 
 
 
 Whereas concurrent indexes are  allowed  in Postgresql, Alembic does  not  support concurrent operations, only one process should be running at a time. 
 
 Alembic supports   concurrently indexes creation
