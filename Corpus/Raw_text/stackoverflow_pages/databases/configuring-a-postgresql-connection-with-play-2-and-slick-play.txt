*** configuring-a-postgresql-connection-with-play-2-and-slick-play ***

 I'm learning how to build an application using Scala and the Play 2 Framemork. I`ve created a new project using the activator tool, based on "play-scala-intro" current template. 
 The template have a sample app using the Play-Slick 1.0 for managing dependencies and is configured with a H2 DB, that worked without problems. 
 When I tried to change to a Postgres DB, I'm running in trouble. I get an error 500, telling me:  
 
 "Cannot connect to database [default]". 
 
 In the stack trace, the exception is: 
 
 "Configured Slick driver org.postgresql.Driver is not an instance of
  requested profile slick.profile.BasicProfile" 
 
 So... What I already did: 
 I added to my build.sbt file the dependency: 
 
 "org.postgresql" % "postgresql" % "9.4-1201-jdbc41" 
 
 In my configuration file (application.conf), the DB connection is configured as:  
 
 slick.dbs.default.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
  slick.dbs.default.db.url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/hello_play"
  slick.dbs.default.db.user="postgres" slick.dbs.default.db.password="" 
 
 PS: I've tried with slick.dbs.default.driver="org.postgresql.Driver" too... 
 PS2: My db password is empty. I'm connecting with PgAdmin without problems 
 
  must be a slick driver, not a JDBC driver. Your db config should look something like this:
