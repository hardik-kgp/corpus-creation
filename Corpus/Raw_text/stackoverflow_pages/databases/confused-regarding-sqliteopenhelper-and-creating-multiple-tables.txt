*** confused-regarding-sqliteopenhelper-and-creating-multiple-tables ***

 I feel the Android developer guidelines regarding saving data in SQLite is really lacking. I'm confused as to what the general guideline is when it comes to multiple tables. 
 I currently have two Managers that expose (CRUD) two different sets of entities to the UI. 
 Do I: 
 Create a private class SQLiteOpenHelper inside each Manager. Each Helper will have its own onCreate for its own TABLE? 
 or 
 Create a single public class SQLiteOpenHelper that creates both TABLE's? 
 I don't see any clear advantages to using the one above the other but I see both of them being used. What does Android say  about this? 
 
 The following example code creates two tables. I also added code for creating and inserting data. 
 
 USe the following code to insert the data from your required activity.
