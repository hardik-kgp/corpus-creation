 I'm looking for a library to connect to MySQL with Python 3.6. All libraries I found did only work with older versions of Python. Sadly I can't change to an older Python version because i need some functions, which are introduced in Python 3.6. 
 I am programming on a raspberry pi3, but I don't think this should change anything. 
 Thanks for any help! 
 
  supports python3.6 officially.
