*** connect-to-a-heroku-database-with-pgadmin ***

 I would like to manage my heroku database with   client. By now, I've been doing this with  .
When I use data from   to connect de DB using  , I obtain: 
 
 An error has occurred: 
 Error connecting to the server: FATAL:  permission denied for database
  "postgres" DETAIL:  User does not have CONNECT privilege. 
 
 Any guide on how to achieve the connection? 
 
 Open the "Properties" of the Heroku server in pgAdminIII and change the "Maintenance DB" value to be the name of the database you want to connect to. 
 
 The default setup is suitable for DBAs et al who can connect to any database on the server, but apparently that isn't true in your case. 
 
 After you change the Maintenance DB name as suggested by  araqnid's answer above , you should also add your database to the DB restrictions field because without this you will see thousands of databases and you may not be able to find yours in the list if the list is too long.

 We require SSL for connections outside heroku. Please verify whether you're forcing SSL in your client. 
 Edit: 
 Answered more thoroughly here:  https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/21869/connecting-pgadmin3-to-postgres-on-heroku 
 We don't allow connections to the   database, so be sure to set Maintenance DB to your database name, and be sure to use SSL. 
 That should hopefully suffice. 
 
 Change the Maintenance Database to the name of your Database, e.g. dva70000p0090. This should work.
