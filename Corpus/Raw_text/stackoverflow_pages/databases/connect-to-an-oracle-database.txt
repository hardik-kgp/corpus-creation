*** connect-to-an-oracle-database ***

 I'm trying to connect to an Oracle database but when the the code is executing the line: 
 
 It gives this error. "The program can't start because oraons.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem." I installed the ODP for .net on my computer already from the following site  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/index-085163.html  and referenced the Oracle.DataAccess. 
 I also checked the folder that was installed and I can see the oraons dll in the folder. Here's the code: 
 
 Why can't I connect any suggestions?    
 
 The PATH setting is not necessary. I solved the same issue with a copy of the   into dhe   folder and after that the installation works. 
 There is a difference between an Oracle setup via installer and the xcopy depoyment. I don't now why. Both installations had the same registry setting:  
 
 and the   points to the   folder of the  . That means a PATH setting to the   folder of the   does not help. An additional   to the   of the client would help. I think that is not necessary. Only a copy of the   into the   is enough. 
 
 I ended up referencing the ManagedDataAccess.Client instead of just the Data.Access.Client one and it worked. 
 
 I was getting that error in my test project. The problem was that I was opening Visual Studio from a command line that had an old PATH. After opening everything fresh, it worked. 
 Check the PATH from your code, and make sure the oracle folder is in the PATH.
