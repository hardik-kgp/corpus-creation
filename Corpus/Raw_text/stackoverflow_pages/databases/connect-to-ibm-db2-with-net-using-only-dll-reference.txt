*** connect-to-ibm-db2-with-net-using-only-dll-reference ***

 I would like to connect to a DB2 database, specifically an iSeries version, using .Net and C# by referencing a .dll and NOT installing any software on the server. Currently we use the  **IBM.Data.DB2.iSeries.dll**
, which is installed as part of iSeries access for windows. I don't want to have to install all of that. But apparently I don't have an option because the other provider  **IBM.Data.DB2.dll**
 also requires you to install software before it will work according to this over stackoverflow post:  IBM.Data.DB2 
 Is there anyway to connect from .Net c# code to DB2 by simply referencing a .dll in your code and NOT installing other software on the server? 
 I know you can do this with Java and the JT Open toolbox ( http://jt400.sourceforge.net/ ). Why can't you do this with .Net? 
 Here is a BASIC example of how we currently use the IBM.Data.DB2.iSeries.dll. 
 
 Thanks for your time,

 My question was answered in an IBM forum.  Here are the answers.

 **Answer1:**

Hi Welzie,
While I am not familiar with the JT Open product per say, it is most likely based on a Type 4 JDBC driver, which is a Java only driver on the client side ( as opposed to older Type 2 JDBC driver which required a non-Java component on the client ). Being a Java only driver, allows JT Open to do what you're describing. 
The .NET driver however, has a much more complicated dependency structure, and as such, requires multiple DLLs to be layed down on the client, both managed and un-managed. Moreover, connectivity to an iSeries server would also require a DB2 Connect licence to be available on the client. Therefore, the minimal client install that is required to support .NET connectivity to a DB2 server is the IBM Data Server Driver ( which is about 40 MB installed ). IBM Data Server Driver is a freely distributred client package that can be downloaded from IBM website. However, as I stated above, to connect to an iSeries server, you would need a DB2 Connect licence as well. 
 Regards,
Alex 
 **Answer2:**

The IBM.Data.DB2.iSeries.dll provider requires many other parts of the IBM i Access for Windows product, for example to handle the TCP/IP communications stack, security/logon handling, CCSID conversions, etc. It cannot be copied or installed as a standalone dll.
