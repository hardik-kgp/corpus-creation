*** connecting-oracle-to-sql-server-via-database-link ***

 I am trying to connect from Oracle 10G(on UNIX) to a SQL Server database (On windows). I have looked at the manual and i will admit that i am finding the documentation quite difficult to follow. There seems to be several options to use but none of the documentation describe how each option works.  
 As an example, i have been given the following information on the database i need to connect to (i.e. the SQL Server database) 
 
 Username 
 Password 
 Database Name [lets assume the database name is data_extract] 
 
 To connect the above i made the following changes  
 **$ORACLE_HOME/hs/admin/inithsodbc.ora**

 
 **$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora**

 
 **$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora**

 
 Note: In listener.ora, i only added the last SID_DESC entry.  
 I then went on and created the database link as shown below 
 
 When i try to access a table i get the following error 
 
 A couple of things i am not sure of 
 
 Where do i specify the username and password to access the sql server from the oracle db to the sql server db 
 Having read around on the internet, i can see some people refering to a DSN datasource. I am told that the information that i have is all i need. Is this correct or do i need something else? 
 The sid i specified in inithsodbc.ora and tnsnames.ora is actually the sql server database. Is this correct?  
 
 Any help with the above will be appreciated. Thanks 
 
 I used Data Direct drivers which had to be configured on the Oracle UNIX machine.  You must create the ODBC connection in UNIX in order to be able to see SQL Server. (At least that has always been how I have done it) 
 
 In order to create a database link to SQL Server, you have to enclose your connect name and password between double quotes, like below:
