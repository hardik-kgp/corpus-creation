*** connecting-postgresql-with-sqlalchemy ***

 I know this might be really a simple question but I don't know the solution. What is happening here when I try to connect to postgresql? I am self learner in this field of database and programming so please be gentle with me.
When I try following code: 
 
 I get this error: 
 
 Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "", line 1, in 
      db = sqlalchemy.create_engine('postgresql:///tutorial.db')
    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\sqlalchemy-0.7.5dev-py2.7.egg\sqlalchemy\engine__init__.py", line 327, in create_engine
      return strategy.create(*args, **kwargs)
    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\sqlalchemy-0.7.5dev-py2.7.egg\sqlalchemy\engine\strategies.py", line 64, in create

      psycopg =  **import**
('psycopg2')
  ImportError: No module named psycopg2 
 
 Do I need to install psycopg2 separately? What is the correct connection string for postgresql? 
 
 Yes, psycopg2 are basically the Python drivers for PostgreSQL that need to be installed separately. 
 A list of valid connection strings can be found here, yours is a bit off (you need to the username, the password and hostname as specified in the link below): 
 http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql 
 
 You would need to   and  .
An example of a SQLAlchemy connection string that uses psycopg2: 
 
 You could also connect to your database using the psycopg2 driver exclusively: 
 
 However, using the psycopg2 driver to connect does not take advantage of SQLAlchemy. 
 
 Yes, you need to install psycopg2 separately, if you're using linux you can simply enter the following line to the terminal:   if this doesn't work try using sudo:
