*** convert-a-normal-postgres-database-to-postgis-database ***

 I have a normal postgres database with lots of geo coded data. This is just present two columns as latitude and longitude.  
 I want to convert this database to PostGIs database. Can anyone suggest me a way to convert the database i have? I don't want to create a new postgis tempalte based database and then move the whole data one by one.

 Next, spatially enable each table with a geometry column and populate the column with the long/lat data points: 
 
 Also consider using the  geography  type: 
 
 
 I know this is older... but I'd add something to address a previous issue: 
 @Cerin, make sure you apt-get install postgresql-x.x-postgis-2.1, not just apt-get install postgis. I had that issue before as well
