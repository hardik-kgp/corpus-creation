*** convert-datetime-value-into-string ***

 I am fetching the current date & time using NOW() in mysql.  I want to convert the date value into a varchar and concat it with another string. How do I do it? 
 
 Use  DATE_FORMAT() 
 
 
 This is super old, but I figured I'd add my 2c.   does indeed return a string, but I was looking for the   function, in the situation that I already had a datetime string in the database and needed to pattern match against it:

 In this case, you'd use: 
 
 This answers a slightly different question, but the question title seems ambiguous enough that this might help someone searching. 
 
 Try this: 
 
 
 10 char on date field based on full date  . 
 8 char on time field based on full time  . 
 
 It depends on the format you want it. normally you can use script above and you can concat another field or string as you want it. 
 Because actually date and time field tread as string if you read it. But of course you will got error while update or insert it.
