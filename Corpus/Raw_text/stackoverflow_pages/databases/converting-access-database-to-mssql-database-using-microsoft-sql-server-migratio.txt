 Access Object Collector error: Database
           Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {CD7791B9-43FD-42C5-AE42-8DD2811F0419} failed due to the following
  error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from HRESULT:
  0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)). This error may be a result of
  running SSMA as 64-bit application while having only 32-bit
  connectivity components installed or vice versa. You can run 32-bit
  SSMA application if you have 32-bit connectivity components or 64-bit
  SSMA application if you have 64-bit connectivity components, shortcut
  to both 32-bit and 64-bit SSMA can be found under the Programs menu.
  You can also consider updating your connectivity components from
   http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=197502 .
           An error occurred while loading database content. 
 
 
 I remember this error.  I had to find the EXE for 32-bit SSMA even though I was running 64-bit windows.  The default installed location was: 
 C:\Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access\bin 
 And the filename was: 
 SSMAforAccess32.exe 
 
 Just to complete the other side of the story...   
 If you have a 64-bit setup, you might have to go the other direction 
and install the 64-bit MSAccess 2010 engine.   
 I'm running Access 2013, and I believe it is 64-bit.
But the SMAA tool threw the 80040154 error.   
 
 I think SMAA can't or doesn't use the 64-bit connectivity drivers that come with 64-bit Access 2013.   
 
 So using the 32-bit SMAA didn't help.   
 
 Installing the 64-bit 2010 engine did.   
 
 I got it as a free standalone download here:

 After the quick install of this, I simply started 
SMAA 64-bit again, 
and the wizard was successful the first time.

 [SOLVED] 
 I encountered the same error while using SSMA v7.7.0 for migrating from MS-Access 2016 DB to SQL Server 2017. Fortunately, I got it fixed by installing  Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable 
 
 with regards to installing the runtime environment of Access to get around the 80040154 error from SSMA: With Access 2016, I found that the runtime environment would not install because I already had Access installed. I needed to deinstall Access, then install the runtime only version. Then, SSMA would run without the 80040154 error. Total pain tho. 
 
 This worked for me.
After I installed the Runtime Access 2010 and Started SSMA 7.0 the migration was successful.
