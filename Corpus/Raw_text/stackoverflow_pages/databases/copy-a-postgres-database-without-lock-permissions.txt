*** copy-a-postgres-database-without-lock-permissions ***

 I need to copy a postgres DB from one server to another, but the credentials I have do not have permission to lock the database so a pg_dump fails.  I have full read/update/insert rights to the DB in question. 
 How can I make a copy of this database?  I'm not worried about inconsistencies (it is a small database on a dev server, so minimal risks of inconsistencies during the extract) 
 [edit] Full error: 
 
 
 
 ERROR:  permission denied for relation sl_node 
 
 This is your real problem.  
 Make sure the user bob has   privilege for  . Is that by any chance a Slony system table or something?  
 
 This worked for me    
 
 Then create a DB and run pg_restore it:     
 
 
 You need   permissions (read) on all database objects to make a dump, not   permissions (whatever that may be). What's the complete error message when you start   to make a dump? 
 
  doesn't lock the entire database, it does get an explicit lock on all the tables it is going to dump, though. This lock is taken in "access share mode", which is the same lock level required by a SELECT statement: it's intended just to guard against one of the tables being dropped between it deciding which tables to dump and then getting the data. 
 So it sounds like your problem might actually be that it is trying to dump a table you don't have permission for? PostgreSQL doesn't have database-level read/update/insert rights, so maybe you're just missing the select privilege from a single table somewhere... 
 As Frank H. suggested, post the full error message and we'll try to help decode it.

 this link helped me a lot. It refers to another one,

 I first change the ownship to rds_superuser, then paste this piece of code,  
 
 thereafter, I am able to dump my whole database. 
 
 Did you run 'pg_dump' with the correct -U (user who owns that db) ? If yes, then just like other poster said, check the permissions.
