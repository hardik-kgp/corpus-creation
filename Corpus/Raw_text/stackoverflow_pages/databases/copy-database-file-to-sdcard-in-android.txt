 **NOTE :**

 Remember to add permission to write to external storage with 
 , otherwise sd.canWrite() will be false. 
 
 Unfortunatelly, the accepted answer is not relevant for these days. The problem is on wrong detected SD path. Actual path usually depends on manufacterer of mobile device and could be different on different models. 
 I figured out a simple solution to detect an actual path to SD independently of android version, ContextCompat.getExternalFilesDirs[1] contains a relevant string. Tested on devices with android 6 till 9 version 
 The second one trouble is defined path to DB. It should contains "data/data/" before package name like: "/data/data/" + getPackageName() + "/databases/" + dbFilename; 
 Here the part of code from my project
