*** copy-values-from-one-column-to-another-in-the-same-table ***

 How can I make a copy values from one column to another? I have: 
 
 I want to have: 
 
 What mysql query should I have? 
 
 Short answer for the code in question is: 
 
 Here   is the table name and it's surrounded by grave accent (aka back-ticks `) as this is MySQL convention to  escape keywords  (and   is a keyword in that case). 
 BEWARE, that this is pretty dangerous query which will wipe everything in column   in every row of your table replacing it by the   (regardless of it's value) 
 It is more common to use   clause to limit your query to only specific set of rows: 
 
 
 
 You can also do any mathematical changes in the process or use MySQL functions to modify the values. 
 
 try this: 
 
 
 **BEWARE**
 : Order of update columns is critical 
 **GOOD**
: What I want saves existing Value of Status to PrevStatus 
 
 **BAD**
: Status & PrevStatus both end up as 44  
 
 
 try following: 
 
 it creates copy of all values from "number" and paste it to "test" 
 
 Following worked for me.. 
 
 Ensure you are not using Safe-mode in your query editor application. If you are, disable it! 
 Then run following sql command  
 
 
 for a table say, 'test_update_cmd', source value column col2, target
  value column col1 and condition column col3: - 
 
 
 Good Luck! 
 
 you can do it with Procedure also so i have a procedure for this
