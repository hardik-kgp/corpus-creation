*** copying-mongodb-database-into-local-machine ***

 I have a MongoDB database that resides on a remote server machine whose IP address is 192.168.1.20 on a local network. For development and testing purposes, and since I am not allowed to modify or delete the database on the server for security purposes, I want to copy the database on my local machine for my personal use. 
 Can anyone please tell me, how do I achieve this? 
 
 There is  copy database  command which I guess should be good fit for your need. 
 
 Alternatively, you can just stop MongoDb, copy the database files to another server and run an instance of MongoDb there. 
 
 I do this by creating a dump of the remote db to my local machine, which I then restore: 
 
 **Make sure you have a mongo instance up and running**
 (eg. run   from your bin folder in a terminal window. On my windows computer that's C:\mongodb\bin) 
 **Make a dump from remote db**
: Open a new terminal window, move to the bin folder again, run:  
 
 (Change the parameters to suit your own situation.) 
 **Restore the dumped database:**
 Once the dump has been made, run the following command so that you have a local db:  
 
 (replace nameOfRemoteDB with the name of the remote db, the same as in previous command, and replace theNameYouWantForYourLocalDB with the name that you want your new local db to have) 
 
 
 The mongoexport command:
 http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/import-export/ 
 Or, mongodump command:
 http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/program/mongodump/ 
 
 mongodb has commandline tools for importing and exporting. Take a look at   and  
 http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/reference/mongodump/ 
 http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/reference/mongorestore/ 
 this even works over the network 
 
 This should be a comment to the answer of @malla, but I don't have enough reputation to comment so I'm posting it here for other's reference.  
 In step 2, When you are trying to dump file from a remote server, remember to add out option so that you can restore locally later: (in my first try, I didn't add it and it failed, saying dump\db_name was not found).I'm not sure whether my way efficient or not. But it worked for me. 
 **Step 2:**

 
 **Step 3:**

 
 
 You can use the  mongoexport  command to copy the database to your local machine.
