*** copying-postgresql-database-to-another-server ***

 I'm looking to copy a production PostgreSQL database to a development server. What's the quickest, easiest way to go about doing this? 
 
 You don't need to create an intermediate file. You can do  
 
 or 
 
 using   or   to connect to a remote host. 
 With a big database or a slow connection, dumping a file and transfering the file compressed may be faster.  
 As Kornel said there is no need to dump to a intermediate file, if you want to work compressed you can use a compressed tunnel 
 
 or 
 
 but this solution also requires to get a session in both ends.   
 **Note:**
   is for backing up and   is for restoring. So, the  first command in this answer is to copy from local to remote and the second one is from remote to local . More ->  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/app-pgdump.html 
 
 
 Then copy the backup to your development server, restore with: 
 
 
 Use  pg_dump , and later  psql  or  pg_restore  - depending whether you choose -Fp or -Fc options to pg_dump. 
 Example of usage: 
 
 
 If you are looking to migrate between versions (eg you updated postgres and have 9.1 running on localhost:5432 and 9.3 running on localhost:5434) you can run: 
 
 Check out the  migration docs . 
 
  seems to be the better way of doing this now, especially for large databases. 
 
 Run this command with database name, you want to backup, to take dump of DB. 
 
 Now scp this dump file to remote machine where you want to copy DB.  
 
 On remote machine run following command in ~/some/folder to restore the DB. 
 
 
 I struggled quite a lot and eventually the method that allowed me to make it work with Rails 4 was: 
 on your old server 
 
 I had to use the postgres linux user to create the dump. also i had to use -c to force the creation of the database on the new server. --inserts tells it to use the INSERT() syntax which otherwise would not work for me :( 
 then, on the new server, simpy: 
 
 to transfer the dump.sql file between server I simply used the "cat" to print the content and than "nano" to recreate it copypasting the content. 
 Also, the ROLE i was using on the two database was different so i had to find-replace all the owner name in the dump. 
 
 Let me share a Linux shell script to copy your table data from one server to another PostgreSQL server. 
 **Reference taken from this blog:**

 **Linux Bash Shell Script for data migration between PostgreSQL Servers:**

 
 I am just migrating the data; please create a blank table at your destination/second database server. 
 This is a utility script. Further, you can modify the script for generic use something like by adding parameters for host_name, database_name, table_name and others 
 
 
 Dump your database :  
 
 Import your database back:  
 
 Accepted answer is correct, but if you want to avoid entering the password interactively, you can use this:
