*** correct-use-of-transactions-in-sql-server ***

 I have 2 commands and need both of them executed correctly or none of them executed. So I think I need a transaction, but I don't know how to use it correctly. 
 What's the problem with the following script? 
 
 The   command is executed, but the   command has a problem. 
 How can I implement this to rollback both commands if any of them have an error in execution? 
 
 Add a try/catch block, if the transaction succeeds it will commit the changes, if the transaction fails the transaction is rolled back: 
 
 
 At the beginning of stored procedure one should put  SET XACT_ABORT ON  to instruct Sql Server to automatically rollback transaction in case of error. If ommited or set to OFF one needs to test  @@ERROR  after each statement or use  TRY ... CATCH rollback  block. 
 
 Easy approach:
