*** correct-way-to-retrieve-a-single-object-from-realm-database ***

 I am absolutely loving Realm (0.92) in combination with Swift but have a question about reading an object from the database. My goal is to retrieve a single object with a known, unique ID (which also happens to be the primary key. 
 All the documentation appears to be oriented around queries for multiple objects which are then filtered. In this case I know the object ID and, since it is known to be unique, would like to retrieve it directly. 
 My current approach is as follows: 
 
 This seems heavy-handed. Documentation from prior versions suggest that there is a more direct way but I can't seem to locate it in the documentation. 
 The problem with my current approach is that it is crashing with an exception on the following function: 
 
 The exception is mysteriously reported as: 
 
 EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0xedf) 
 
 Any suggestions are very welcome.  
 Anticipating one line of questioning: I have confirmed that replacing prevBook.nextID with a known, good ID does not solve the problem 
 
 object(ofType:forPrimaryKey:)  is what you're looking for:  . There's no simpler way than   if you need to search for the object by something other than the primary key.
