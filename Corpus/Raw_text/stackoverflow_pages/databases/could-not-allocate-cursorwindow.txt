*** could-not-allocate-cursorwindow ***

 I'm operating on an  SQLite3  database in my android app. I just read from the pre populated database that has 200k rows and 14 columns. Entries are words. Datatype of all columns is text. Querying for words up to 11 letters (eg. ABANDONMENT) works fine. But for 12 or greater (eg. ABANDONMENTS), the app crashes. Here is the logcat: 
 
 code: 
 
 So what does the error mean and why is the app crashing? 
 
 Error -12 means cursor leak.
Pls try close it as follow: 
 
 
 I was quering in a loop. And closing the cursor inside the loop and not outside solved the problem. 
 
 Android cursors read all the query results into memory, and have a limit of 1 MB for that data. 
 This limit was chosen because this amount of data is likely to make your app run sluggishly on a mobile device. 
 You should, if possible: 
 
 do the computations not in your code but in SQL; 
 query only the data that you need (i.e., do not use   but get only the columns you need, and use a   filter); 
 read the data in smaller portions.
