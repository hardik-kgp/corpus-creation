 I have a query which gives output as  
 
 Could not determine polymorphic type because input has type "unknown" 
 
 **Query :**

 
 I have a  **postgres**
 database 
 
 The issue here is that   doesn't actually specify a type for the value. It's the   type, and PostgreSQL usually infers the real type from things like what column you're inserting it into or what function you pass it to. 
 In this case, you pass it to  , which is a  polymorphc  function. It can take inputs of the pseudo-type  , which really just means "figure it out at runtime". 
 PostgreSQL would still figure it out except that   doesn't actually take a   as input. It takes   - another polymorphic type, like   for arrays.  
 So there's nothing in the query to tell PostgreSQL what type that   is. It could guess you meant  , but it's a bit too fussy for that. So it complains. The issue simplifies down to: 
 
 To solve this, write a typed literal: 
 
 or use a cast: 
 
 or the PostgreSQL shorthand:
