*** couldnt-start-mysql-while-starting-xampp ***

 I am new in Ubuntu, I installed XAMPP in my Ubuntu 10.04. When I start XAMPP it says MySQL couldn't start. 
 Here is my terminal ouput: 
 
 And then as I go to  , I got stuck on the XAMPP splash-screen, nothing happens if I choose language.  
 
 This Worked For me as a Charm. [I used Ubuntu 12.04 and Xampp] 
 
 & Now Start Your Xampp 
 
 It might just be that the   doesn't have the right permissions. Before reinstalling everything, try running the commands below, it worked for me: 
 
 
 Just remove the version where the MySQL is not started with the command  
and the command: 
 
 Replace   with your file name. After restarting your lampp, it will work fine. 
 
 You may not have completely removed your old lampp instance. Please remove it and install lampp once again. 
 
 It might be the right   problem. Some solutions guide you to set it to   which is not recommended.  Try to set it to original permissions as installed. (especially after you restore from a tar without preserving the permissions) 
 
 
 Even I had the same issue. Always check for the error log before proceeding to find the root cause. Sometimes it could be file system space issue. In my case it was "/" file system was full. After clearing some space I was able to start the services without issues. 
 Thanks,

 XAMPP started successfully on my side, but still got stuck at spalsh screen.
It was solved by giving permission to lang.tmp file 
 
 
 Your previous MySQL installation might be blocking your MySQL from the xampp bundle. I also had the same problem. Just uninstall the previous MySQL. Open the terminal(Ctrl ALt T) and paste the following code: 
 First stop XAMPP: 
 
 Uninstall MySQL: 
 
 Start XAMPP: 
 
 
 I found the answer. First completly uninstall the lampp and then reinstall it. Before uninstalling, stop the lampp using the command: 
 
 and then uninstall/remove it using the command 
 
 then reinstall it.
