*** count-multiple-columns-with-group-by-in-one-query ***

 I count values from multiple columns like this:    
 
 This returns for example for column1 array(attr1 => 2000, attr2 => 3000...) (Each column has specific and few values). The problem is that "table" in my application can be a query with some joins and where clauses, that may take 0.1sec. By doing all that counts "table" is computed each time again which is not necessary. Is there any way to take the results i want with one query, or "cache" the query that produces table? Otherwise i believe denormalization would be the only solution here. And i want the same results with the above queries. I am using mysql-myisam. 
 
 It's hard to know how to help you without understanding the context / structure of your data, but I believe this might help you: 
 
 
 One solution is to wrap it in a subquery 
 
 
 
 
 You didn't say which database server you are using, but if temp tables are available they may be the best approach.
