*** create-c-sharp-classes-based-of-mysql-table ***

 Is there anything built into .Net or visual studio that will allow my to create classes based off of a MySql table. I guess I am talking about persistence. I just want the class to be a 1 to 1 mapping of the table. Does anything free exist? 
 
 maybe you need something like this: 
 
 
 I adjusted the sql of MeelStorm because it was appearing some errors regarding the language. I put other types of data as well and I drop the class declaration because this is unnecessary to me. So the final result is:

 You can use the Entity Framework for this. It connects well with MySQL.

 NHibernate can connect to MySQL and is Free:

 Subsonic (open source) works with MySQL (5.0+) with special support for InnoDB -

 I use NHibernate with  MyGeneration 
 MyGeneration is a program that can read your database schema and generate code based on a template (in the case of NHibernate, the Entities and Mappings) 
 
 The first example is very good but some types are missing so I'm sharing adding missing types (set, float etc ..)
