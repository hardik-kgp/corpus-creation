*** create-custom-error-message-in-check-constraints-in-sql-server-2008 ***

 I'd like to see the ability to attach custom error messages to CONSTRAINT objects, specifically CHECK constrints. Either directly or via a custom error number in sysmessages. 
 I've seen developers have to create triggers. I think that's not a good reason to implementing it. 
 I'm using SQL SERVER 2008. 
 
 You could name your constraint with a user message. 
 **For Example:**

 
 
 I know this is an old post, but I've found something that may make it a  bit  easier to provide clearer error messages for check constraints to the end-user: the names of check constraints can include carriage returns and line feeds, so the error message can be made a bit easier to see.  
 E.g. creating the following constraint produces the error message below. (the blank lines between the   and   are intentional i.e. they are  **part of the constraint name**
.) 
 
 And when this constraint fails, the resulting message is: 
 
 I tried putting markup in the error message (i.e. constraint name), like   and  , but to no avail. And it may be possible, but really unwieldy, to use this for foreign key constraints as well. I haven't tried it. 
 So it's not a 100% solution, but hopefully easier for the user to see the intended error message. 
 
 You can't directly 
 A CHECK constraint fails with a standard error message. You could use a TRY/CATCH block to parse the error and throw your own (RAISERROR) or use a trigger. 
 I'd check first so it doesn't fire, either is SQL or in client code. And of course you leave the constraint there to protect data integrity 
 So if you have a constraint 
 
 You run the following SQL code or equivalent in your client code:
