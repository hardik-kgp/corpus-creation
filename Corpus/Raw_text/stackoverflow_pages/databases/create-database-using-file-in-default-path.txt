*** create-database-using-file-in-default-path ***

 I want to create an SQL script that creates a database.  Right now, I have this: 
 
 However, this generates the following error: 
 
 I know the problem is that I did not specify fully qualified path for the filenames.  But I want to be able to run this script regardless of the directory structure of the database server.  Is there some way to use a default path? 
 
 You can create a database without specifying file details, like: 
 
 
 Create the database 'Documents' and give file properties through an alter. 
 
 This script is more portable and can be deployed in multiple servers without any modifications. 
 
 See  How do I find the data directory for a SQL Server instance? 
 If you are using SQL Server 2012 or higher, you can find the default path using  
 
 You can then use exec() to construct your CREATE DATABASE statement. 
 This is useful if you want the physical file names of your database to be different from the default name. 
 
 I believe that you can do  
 
 without the ON .... and it will get created with defaults for path and the rest. 
 
 Take a Look on how to create a  Default Path . See if it helps on what you are looking for. 
 Cheers,
