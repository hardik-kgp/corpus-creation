*** create-database-using-script-at-the-default-path ***

 I've generated a script of a database in SQL Server 2008. The generated script has the hardcoded path of where the database would be created. I don't want this path to be hardcoded, I want this path to use the default of the database engine the script is running on. 
 Here is the small portion of the script: 
 
 The path   might not exist on all computers that's why I want it to be chosen by the database engine 
 
 Simply create the database and then adjust all the needed properties directly in files 
 
 
 Why don't use just: 
 
 This will create the database with all the default settings (including paths). You may alter any setting you like later on.
