*** create-database-with-jpa ***

 When I create (using JPA - java persistence api) a persistence unit and then persistence entities they auto create the corresponding tables and fields in the database. 
 **Can I also make it to auto create the database (if it doesn't exist)?**

 My objectif is :  
 I mean it creates inside the database the tables and fields, but not the database, and if the database hasn't been created before (by hand) - everything fails. So before running the project (which will auto generate the tables and fields if needed) I first must create (by hand) a database.  
 I use : Eclipse (Java, Hibernate, Flex/Air), MySQL 
 Thanks for all information 
 
 The database has to be created manually (Fortunatly you didn't ask why ;-). Which is similar to the user/password combination you use to connect to your database server, which must already exist in order to connect to the DB. 
 
 My solution to this problem was to add the following right before I create my entity manager: 
 
 You'll need to either surround that with a try/catch block or add a throws SQLException notation to the function in which it exists. So, for example, here is my   function:
