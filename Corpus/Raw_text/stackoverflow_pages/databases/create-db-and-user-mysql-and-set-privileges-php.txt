 Is there a way to create a new MySQL database, a new MySQL user and give the new user privileges on the new database all using PHP? 
 
 You could do something like this: 
 
 You may look at the MySQL documentation on  GRANT  and  CREATE USER 
 
 Yes, as all these actions can be performed by regular SQL queries.     
 However, I'd refrain from running PHP scripts with database connection from root user. 
 
 If you are hosting your project on CPanel, then the   method will not work to create databases, users, and to grant permissions. 
 You have to use the XML Api for CPanel. 
 
 Download xmlapi.php from  here , or simply search on google for it. 
 This is what worked for me perfectly. 
 
 open PHP myadmin or MySql workbench go to query window then run below query 
 
 
 i will suggest you to use phpmyadmin. 
 you need to do steps: 
 
 open phpmyadmin 
 go to admin section 
 hit on add user account 
 put user name and password 
 set privileges 
 hit the [ go ]button  
 
 that's all 
see in action on youtube [  click here   ] 
 in case if you want to know more about phpMyadmin  go with official  
 but if there is any special reason to do so with php the here is the sql commend
