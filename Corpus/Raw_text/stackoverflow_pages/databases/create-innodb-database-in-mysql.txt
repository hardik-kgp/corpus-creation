*** create-innodb-database-in-mysql ***

 
I tried to create a database type of innodb.I tried this query but its not exectuted.  
CREATE DATABASE "mydd" ENGINE = InnoDB  
I checked the configuration and it says innodb enabled. I also searched in web but only ended up   with creatin innodb tables. I set the database as innodb then all the table
under this will takes the same type and no need to specify again.Also my defauld engine should not be innodb. 
 Can anyone help me out? Thanks. 
 
 I don't think you can specify Engine while creating database. 
 because one database can have multiple engine type tables in it 
 Check create database command at  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-database.html 
 
 Check the syntax for CREATE DATABASE:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-database.html 
 
 CREATE {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF NOT
  EXISTS] db_name
      [create_specification] ... 
 create_specification:
      [DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name   | [DEFAULT] COLLATE [=]
  collation_name 
 
 You can change the default storage engine on starting up mysql, or during your session. See  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-engines.html 
 
 If you omit the ENGINE or TYPE option,
  the default storage engine is used.
  Normally, this is MyISAM, but you can
  change it by using the
  --default-storage-engine or --default-table-type server startup option, or by setting the
  default-storage-engine or
  default-table-type option in the
  my.cnf configuration file. 
 You can set the default storage engine
  to be used during the current session
  by setting the storage_engine or
  table_type variable: 
 SET storage_engine=MYISAM; SET
  table_type=BDB; 
 When MySQL is installed on Windows
  using the MySQL Configuration Wizard,
  the InnoDB or MyISAM storage engine
  can be selected as the default. See
  Section 2.10.3.5, “The Database Usage
  Dialog”. 
 
 
 Hi normally programmers use innodb for table don't know if you can set it for database
