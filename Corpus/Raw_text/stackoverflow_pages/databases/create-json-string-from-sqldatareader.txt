*** create-json-string-from-sqldatareader ***

 **UPDATE**

 I figured it out.  Check out my answer below . 
 
 I'm trying to create a JSON string representing a row from a database table to return in an HTTP response. It seems like  Json.NET  would be a good tool to utilize. However, I'm not sure how to do build the JSON string  **while**
 I'm reading from the database. 
 The problem is marked by the obnoxious comments  
 
 The problem is that I don't know how to read each column from the row from the   such that I can call   and give it the correct information and attach it to the correct column name. So if a row looks like this... 
 
 ... how would I create a   for each such row such that it contains all column names of the row and the corresponding values in each column and then use that   to build a JSON string that is ready for returning through an HTTP Response? 
 Let me know if I need to clarify anything. 
 
 **My version:**

 This doesn't use DataSchema and also wraps the results in an array, instead of using a writer per row. 
 
 
 **EDITED FOR SPECIFIC EXAMPLE:**

 
 
 Got it! Here's the C#... 
 
 ... so the   variable is the JSON object that represents the row I wanted to query. Here is the JavaScript... 
 
 Thanks to  Scott  for his answer which inspired me to come to my solution.

 I made the following method where it converts any DataReader to JSON, but only for single depth serialization: 
 you should pass the reader, and the column names as a string array, for example: 
 
 then call the method
