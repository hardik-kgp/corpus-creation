*** create-mdf-sdf-database-dynamically ***

 How can I with "code" create a new .mdf/.sdf database? 
 I've tried this:
 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307283 
 All it does is fail on the ConnectionString. Since I have no connection to a file that exists before I create it, how can I only connect to the SQL Express Server just to create a mdf/sdf database? 
 I want to be able to just connect to the server and create the file, from there it probably will be easier to create the tables and such. 
 Any suggestions? 
 
 
 Change   to  , its good worked 
 Sample use: 
 
 
 Regarding .sdf files (SQL Server CE), you can use the   class to create a new database, as described in  this MSDN article . 
 
 Make sure you have a valid connection string. 
 The database/catalog that you need must be set to a valid database, usually this can be the "master" which is always available and since you will be using master to create a database. 
 
 If you need to create a database from scratch programmatically i normal go into the SQL Server Management Studio and create it through the gui in a first step. But instead of clicking on the OK button in the bottom right, i click on the Script button in the top toolbar. This will give me a complete sql script for creating the database i'd like to have. Then i can alter the script and change the parts i'd like dynamically. 
 
 I suppose the problem  **is**
 in the ConnectionString. It should point to the valid instance of the  **master**
 db (as in the article you refer to). Make sure it is correct, and it should  work. 
 
 Use a connectionString with  . Since only master has default access to create a database.
