*** create-multiple-objects-without-multiple-hits-to-the-db-in-django-1-8 ***

 With Django 1.8 how do I create multiple objects and write to db in a single db transaction?   
 It seems previous versions had @commit_manually.  But when I try to modify this code:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/29834940  I get an exception  
 
 At lot of posts I’ve seen say to wrap in “with transaction.atomic()” block but this hits the db in every loop.   
 Here is a simplified version of my code.  I haven’t ran it but it should show what I’m trying to do.      
 
 I'm trying to make all these changes and only hit the db once.  I know there is model.objects.bulk_create but I couldn't find a what to handle the m2m relationships.  Also bulk_create doesn't return the the db instances so I have to pull them out of the db for the m2m relationships. 
 
 You can't do all of them in one query. However, you are on the right track. You should be using   for batch insertion and do one more lookup for getting them back as objects in order to add into  . 
 If you are too concerned that the latter query will perform slowly, you can set   or,   for improving performance. 
 You also want to maintain the atomicity of operations using transactions, so that any   fails, all of them should be rolled back:   
 
 Please see Django documentation for more information about  autocommit  behavior.
