*** create-sqlite-database-in-android ***

 I want to create a SQLite database in my app, which contains three tables, I will add data into tables and will use them later on. 
 but I like to keep database ,as if when app is first time installed it checks whether the database exist or not, if exists it updates it else if not then creates a new database. 
 further more I am making a DB class to facilitate my app,so  I wont be creating an activity for my database creation. 
 if there are possible advices, please share with me 
 
 Better example is [here] 
 
 
 If you want to keep the database between uninstalls you have to put it on the SD Card. This is the only place that won't be deleted at the moment your app is deleted. But in return it can be deleted by the user every time.  
 If you put your DB on the SD Card you can't use the  SQLiteOpenHelper  anymore, but you can use the source and the architecture of this class to get some ideas on how to implement the creation, updating and opening of a databse. 
 
 
 
 this is the full source code to direct use, 
 
 
 Why not refer to the  documentation  or the sample code shipping with the SDK? There's code in the samples on how to create/update/fill/read databases using the helper class described in  the document I linked. 
 
 To understand how to use sqlite database in android with best practices see -  Android with sqlite database 
 There are few classes about which you should know and those will help you model your tables and models i.e android.provider.BaseColumns 
 Below is an example of a table 
 
 
 Here is code 
 **DatabaseMyHandler.class**

 
 **Customer.class**
