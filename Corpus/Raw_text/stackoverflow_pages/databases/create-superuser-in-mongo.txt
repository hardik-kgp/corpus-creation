*** create-superuser-in-mongo ***

 I'm trying to create a user in mongo who can do anything in any db. 
 According to the guide I created a new admin:  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/add-user-administrator 
 This is the code: 
 
 Then I stopped mongo, enabled the auth and restarted mongo. 
 Then I tried to create a database with his user. 
 According with this guide:  http://www.mkyong.com/mongodb/how-to-create-database-or-collection-in-mongodb/ 
 
 And I get this: "not authorized for insert on fragola.users" 
 Anyone can help me? 
 
 The role   gives the user the ability to create users and assign arbitrary roles to them. Because of this, that user has the power to do anything on the database, because he can give anybody any permission (including himself). 
 However, the   role by itself doesn't allow the user to do anything else besides assigning arbitrary rights to arbitrary users. To actually do something on the database, that user needs to have the following additional roles: 
 
 A user who has the above three rights  and    is a true super-user and can do anything.
