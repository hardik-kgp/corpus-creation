 i created a sequence using the following query, 
 
 Now when i try to create a table which uses the above sequence, it is throwing the following error, 
 
 I used the following query to create a table with sequence.nextval, 
 
 
 **Oracle 12c**

 We now finally have   columns like many other databases, in case of which a sequence is auto-generated behind the scenes. This solution is much faster than a trigger-based one  as can be seen in this blog post . 
 So, your table creation would look like this: 
 
 **Oracle 11g and below**

 According to the  documentation , you cannot do that: 
 
 Restriction on Default Column Values A DEFAULT expression cannot contain references to PL/SQL functions or to other columns, the pseudocolumns CURRVAL, NEXTVAL, LEVEL, PRIOR, and ROWNUM, or date constants that are not fully specified. 
 
 The standard way to have "auto increment" columns in Oracle is to use triggers, e.g. 
 
 Read more about  Oracle TRIGGERs  in the documentation 
 
 In Oracle 12c, you can now specify the CURRVAL and NEXTVAL sequence pseudocolumns as default values for a column. Alternatively, you can use Identity columns; see: 
 
 reference doc 
 articles: Enhancements in Oracle DB 12cR1 (12.1):  Default Values for Table Columns  and  Identity Columns in 12.1 
 
 E.g., 
 
 
 I for myself prefer Lukas Edger's solution.   
 But you might want to know there is also a function  SYS_GUID  which can be applied as a default value to a column and generate unique ids. 
 you can read more about pros and cons  here 
 
 You can use Oracle's  **SQL Developer**
 tool to do that (My Oracle DB version is 11). While creating a table choose   **Advanced option**
 and click on the  **Identity Column**
 tab at the bottom and from there choose   **Column Sequence**
. This will generate a  AUTO_INCREMENT  column (Corresponding Trigger and Squence) for you.   
 
 In  **Oracle 12c**
 you can also declare an  **identity column**

 
 examples & performance tests  here  ... where, is shorts, the conclusion is that the  direct use of the sequence  or the new  identity column  are  **much faster than the triggers.**
