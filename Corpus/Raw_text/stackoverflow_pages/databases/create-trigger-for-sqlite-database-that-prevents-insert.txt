*** create-trigger-for-sqlite-database-that-prevents-insert ***

 I'm trying to make a trigger for a sqlite database that represents a school. I have a table called Administrators with this schema: 
 
 I want to ensure that there is only one principal. I've tried everything I can think of and I keep getting errors at various locations in the trigger. The last one I've tried says there is an error near "IF" 
 
 Could anyone please help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks! 
 
 See the  trigger documentation ; you can use only  ,  ,  , and   statements inside a trigger. 
 To raise errors, use the   function from inside a  : 
 
 (You also need to check  s.) 
 
 An easy way is that you could have first check the database if anyone that is a principal exists, then perform necessary action 
 writing a trigger for such trivial task is an overkill
