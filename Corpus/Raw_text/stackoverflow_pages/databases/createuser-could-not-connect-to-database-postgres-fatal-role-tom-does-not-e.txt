*** createuser-could-not-connect-to-database-postgres-fatal-role-tom-does-not-e ***

 I'm trying to set up Postgres for the first time, and I need to create a user with permissions to read and create databases. However, when I use "createuser username" in my terminal I get the following message:  
 
 createuser: could not connect to database postgres: FATAL:  role "tom" does not exist 
 
 Tom is my Ubuntu user account that I'm logged into right now. I'm trying to create a username of "postgres" then do a "psql -U psql template1" so I can create a database and assign an owner to it for my Rails app.  
 Any help? 
 
 You mentioned Ubuntu so I'm going to guess you installed the PostgreSQL packages from Ubuntu through apt. 
 If so, the   PostgreSQL user account already exists and is configured to be accessible via   authentication for unix sockets in  . You get to it by running commands as the   unix user, eg: 
 
 This is all in the  Ubuntu PostgreSQL  documentation that's the first Google hit for "Ubuntu PostgreSQL" and is covered in numerous Stack Overflow questions. 
 (You've made this question a lot harder to answer by omitting details like the OS and version you're on, how you installed PostgreSQL, etc.) 
 
 See git gist with instructions here 
 Run this:  
 
 OR 
 
 in your terminal to get into postgres 
 
 Run  
 
 Note: Replace new_username with the user you want to create, in your case that will be tom. 
 
 Since you want that user to be able to create a DB, you need to alter the role to superuser 
 
 To confirm, everything was successful,  
 
 **Update/Modification (For Mac):**

 I recently encountered a similar error on my Mac:  
 
 This was because my installation was setup with a database superuser whose role name is the same as your login (short) name. 
 But some linux scripts assume the superuser has the traditional role name of  
 **How did I resolve this?**

 If you installed with   run: 
 
 OR:  
 
 If you installed with   for Mac run: 
 
 P.S: replace 10.5 with your PostgreSQL version 
 
 
 this should help you as this will happen if the administrator has not created a PostgreSQL user account for you. It could also be that you were assigned a PostgreSQL user name that is different from your operating system user name, in that case you need to use the -U switch. 
 
 Your error is posted in the official documentation. You can  read this article . 
 I have copied the reason for you (and hyperlinked the URLs) from that article: 
 
 This will happen if the administrator has not created a PostgreSQL user account for you. (PostgreSQL user accounts are distinct from operating system user accounts.) If you are the administrator, see  Chapter 20  for help creating accounts. You will need to become the operating system user under which PostgreSQL was installed (usually postgres) to create the first user account. It could also be that you were assigned a PostgreSQL user name that is different from your operating system user name; in that case you need to use the -U switch or set the PGUSER environment variable to specify your PostgreSQL user name 
 
 For your purposes, you can do: 
 1) Create a PostgreSQL user account: 
 
 (the   option to set a password; the   option for allowing the creation of database for your username 'tom'. Note that 'tom' is your operating system username. That way, you can execute PostgreSQL commands without  ing.) 
 2) Now you should be able to execute   and other PostgreSQL commands. 
 
 1- Login as default PostgreSQL user (postgres) 
 
 2- As postgres user. Add a new database user using the   command 
 
 3-exit 
 
 
 I had the same issue, i just do this 
 sudo su - postgres 
 createuser odoo -U postgres -dRSP  #P for password
    ( **odoo**
 or  **user name**
 that you want o give the postgres access) 
 
 On Windows use: 
 
 Add   or   as appropriate.  
 See  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createuser.html  for further options. 
 
 You need to first run initdb. It will create the database cluster and the initial setup
