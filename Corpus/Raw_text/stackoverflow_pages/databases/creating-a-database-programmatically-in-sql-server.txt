*** creating-a-database-programmatically-in-sql-server ***

 How can I create a database programmatically and what is the minimum information I need to do this? 
 **Please**
 no "SQL Server Management Object API " suggestions. 
 
 
 
 You can either use the  SQL Server Management Object API  (see task " creating, altering and removing databases "): 
 
 Information on how to get started is  here . During SQL server installation you need to install the client SDK, the SMO assemblies are in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\SDK\Assemblies 
 Or if you don't want the dependency on these assemblies, you can also simply run DDL statements using ADO.Net (e.g.  see this question ): 
 
 Obviously you need a correct connection string: known sql server instance and a user with CREATE DATABASE permission. 
 
 From the  creators : 
 
 **To create in default location with default settings, just:**
  
 
 **Or, to create it in a specific location:**

 
 Even in case the execution fails, give it another try. The db files might have got created. 
 
 You need to open a connection to the server, i.e. you need a server and instance name.  
 You also need the proper access rights to create a database, so you might need some user name and password depending on the authentication settings on the server. 
 From the server name and authentication information you can construct a  connection string  and open a connection. 
 Then you can use the   SQL command (see  here on MSDN ). The only needed parameter for this command is a database  name . 
 
 You need connection information: server, possibly instance, a user having create database rights on that server/instance and the corresponding password. Then you can use SMO for creating the database. Here is a small PowerShell example that you can very easily "translate" to C#, for example: 
 
 
 Assuming you have the rights to fire off a CREATE DATABASE statement you can do so as you would any other query. 
 I should stress that being able to do so requires quite high privileges on the server and this would be restricted to DBAs in QA and Production environments. 
 For that reason I would make sure that your connection uses Windows Integrated Security.  That way when the appropriate DBA runs your application the app will function as requested. 
 Once you have created your database you will also need to fire off the T-SQL to create logins and create users. I'm taking it as obvious that CREATE TABLE/VIEW statements will be needed.
