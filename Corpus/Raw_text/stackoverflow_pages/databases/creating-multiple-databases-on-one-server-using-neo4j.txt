 How do you create multiple databases on one server using neo4j?
I have multiple clients, and I want to separate all client information into different database to avoid data leaks.  
 
 You need to have multiple Neo4j installations with a different port configurations in   and  .  
 Alternatively you might use some virtualization or container tool like http//docker.io for a more sophisticated approach. 
 
 or add a special   to each node for a client, e.g.  .
or create a root node for each clients database, and always begin the querying at the first node. 
 in neo4j db, you can have separate subgraphs. if you do programm your code good, there should be no reason to have such leaks. 
 
 as @stefan-armbruster has mentioned it might be good to use multiple Neo4j docker container instances for running multiple Databases 
 May be below docker compose file should be able to help u in doing this 
 
 once you have saved the above to a docker-compose.yml, run below command 
 
 if you want to run in background 
 
 Now you should be able to access the database as  , if you are using docker-machine, you will have to use the docker-machine IP address to access the database 
 By maintaining multiple docker-compose files with different ports in them, you can maintain multiple database, this is not just for neo4j, you can do it for any type of DBs (Mongo, Redis, RabbitMQ etc.,) 
 for specifying different docker compose file, try below command
