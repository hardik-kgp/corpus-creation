*** creating-new-database-from-a-backup-of-another-database-on-the-same-server ***

 I am trying to create a new database from an old backup of database on the same server.
When using  SQL server management studio  and trying to restore to the new DB from the backup I get this error 
 
 after googling around I found this piece of code 
 
 I was wondering will the move statements mess with the database that the backup came from on that server? 
 Thanks, all help appreciated. 
 
 I think that is easier than this.  
 
 First, create a blank target database. 
 Then, in "SQL Server Management Studio" restore wizard, look for the option to overwrite target database. It is in the 'Options' tab and is called  **'Overwrite the existing database (WITH REPLACE)'**
. Check it. 
 Remember to select target files in 'Files' page.  
 
 You can change 'tabs' at left side of the wizard (General, Files, Options) 
 
 It's even possible to restore without creating a blank database at all.  
 In Sql Server Management Studio, right click on  **Databases**
 and select  **Restore Database...**

 
 In the Restore Database dialog,  **select the Source Database**
 or Device as normal.
Once the source database is selected, SSMS will populate the destination database name based on the original name of the database.  
 It's then possible to change the name of the database and  **enter a new destination database name**
. 
 
 With this approach, you don't even need to go to the Options tab and click the "Overwrite the existing database" option. 
 Also, the database files will be named consistently with your new database name and you still have the option to change file names if you want. 
 
 Checking the Options Over Write Database worked for me :) 
 
 
 Think of it like an archive.
MyDB.Bak contains MyDB.mdf and MyDB.ldf. 
 Restore with Move to say HerDB basically grabs MyDB.mdf (and ldf) from the back up, and copies them as HerDB.mdf and ldf. 
 So if you already had a MyDb on the server instance you are restoring to it wouldn't be touched.
