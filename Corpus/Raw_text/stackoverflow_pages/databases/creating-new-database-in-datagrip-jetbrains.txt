 Anybody know how to create new database in  **DataGrip**
 (database IDE from JetBrains)?
Could not find in  DataGrip Help page . 
 
 In  DataGrip 2017.1  UI for this was introduced 
 
 
 You first define the database. 
File --> Data Sources and Drivers --> Click on the green '+' in the top left corner to select the database type.
And then fill in all the settings in the 'General' tab. 
 For example for PostgreSQL: 
 Host: localhost  
 Database: postgres 
 User: postgres 
 Password: password 
 Once you are set up, Ctrl+Shift+F10 to open the console and you can type your SQL statements, e.g.: 
 
 
 I don't believe the existing answers cover MySQL... In MySQL, creating a new schema is equivalent to creating a new database. For this case, contextual-click (usually right-click) on your connection in the navigation tree and choose New | Schema. Give it a name and 'Execute in database". 
 The name of this schema will show up in the navigation tree and you can then add tables, data, etc. 
 
 The tricky part of creating a new database, is that you have to do it using a DataGrip "Data Source"  where are are connected as a user that has the priviledge to create a database, which is generally the "admin" user that you added when you first installed Postgres which is connected to the main "postgres" database. 
 I like to keep track of all the commands I have run by attaching a new directory (File Menu | Attach Directory) and creating new files with descriptive names, such as "create_my_test_db.sql" and enter the sql to create the database:   
 
 When you want to execute this code, make sure that you are using the correct "console".  DataGrip has a drop-down menu in the upper-right corner above your file menu, so make sure you have selected "postgres@localhost", since this is the user Data Source that has privileges to create a new database.  
 Similarly, to create a new user for this data base, create a new sql file "create_my_test_db_user.sql" 
 
 Then you can create a new Data Source, and set the properties to host = localhost, user = my_test_db_user, and password = keyboard_cat. 
 
 Go to the name of your connection (eg: cat-app@localhost) ,right-click and select Schema. Creating a Schema and Database are same in Mysql.
