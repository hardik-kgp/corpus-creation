*** creating-new-database-under-oracle-xe-on-ubuntu ***

 I've just installed Oracle XE in Ubuntu. Is there any way to create new databases, besides the one that comes with the installation, preferably from the command line so that I can do it from a script? It would be nice to have multiple databases started in the same time, if possible. 
 If it is not possible to create new databases, then maybe there is a way to "clean up" the default database? What I need is to be able to "start over" at any time with a fresh database.  
 I don't have experience with Oracle administration, so any hints, links, suggestions are welcome. 
 Thanks. 
 
 I don't know if you are aware of this, but most beginners confuse this about Oracle: 
 In Oracle, a  database  means a collection of data files and control files stored on disk. You can have only one database with Oracle XE. A database is  mounted  by a Oracle  instance , which means all the background daemons and programs that you can see with  . 
 You probably want a  schema , which is what other DBMS products (e.g. MySQL) often refer to as a "database". IIRC there was no limit on the number of schemas in Oracle XE. You can create those from the APEX UI that comes with XE, or from command line (with   -- again, confusingly, a  user  and  schema  are largely synonymous in this case). 
 I recommend reading the  Concepts  guide from Oracle documentation, most of this basic stuff (e.g. how things are called in Oracle-lingo) is covered there. 
 
 No. It's not possible to install multiple XE instances. Oracle XE only allows one instance by machine from the  Oracle XE home page  you can read:  
 
 Oracle Database XE can be installed on any size host machine with any
  number of CPUs  ( **one database per machine**
), but XE will store up to 4GB
  of user data, use up to 1GB of memory, and use one CPU on the host machine. 
 
 To add more instances you can: 
 
 Use virtualization with an XE instace by virtual machine.   
 Download for free dev/personal use any other  Oracle Database edition , for instance  Oracle Standard Edition One .  
 
 Anyway, in most of the cases only one instance is enough for all the scenarios. Explain why do you need more instance to assistance about solutions. 
 To recreate the Xe instance, i thing the best and easy way is uninstall i and install again.
