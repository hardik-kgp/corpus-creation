*** creating-new-sqlite-dbs-with-pdo ***

 I want to provide a setup feature in my next project and I'm wondering if it's possible to create a SQLite 3 database from scratch with PDO or I'm just stuck at connecting to existing databases via DSN? 
 If it isn't possible with PDO is there any way to create a new DB via PHP? 
 
 A new sqlite database is created when you open a connection to one that doesn't exist. You can just check if the file exists, and then if it doesn't, then just create a new database connection and insert the tables.
