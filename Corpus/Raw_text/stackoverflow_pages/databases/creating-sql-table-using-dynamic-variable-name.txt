 Incorrect syntax near '@SQLTable'.

 Unfortunately, you can't use bind variables for table names, column names, etc.  IN this case you must generate dynamic SQL and use  . 
 
 
 I've left the date separate as I assume you want to calculate it for every run. 
 
 You should look into using synonyms: 
 -- Create a synonym for the Product table in AdventureWorks2008R2.
CREATE SYNONYM MyProduct
FOR AdventureWorks2008R2.Production.Product;
GO 
 -- Query the Product table by using the synonym.
USE tempdb;
GO
SELECT ProductID, Name 
FROM MyProduct
WHERE ProductID < 5;
GO

 this query is correct but just use single quote at the ("FooTable")='FooTable'
