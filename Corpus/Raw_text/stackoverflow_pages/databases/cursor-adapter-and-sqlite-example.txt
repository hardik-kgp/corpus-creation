 Hello 
I am looking for sample code in which cursor adapter is used with sqlite? 
 
 **Really simple example.**

 Here is a really simple, but very effective, example. Once you have the basics down you can easily build off of it. 
 There are two main parts to using a  **Cursor Adapter**
 with SQLite: 
 
 Create a proper  **Cursor**
 from the Database. 
 Create a custom  **Cursor Adapter**
 that takes the  **Cursor**
 data from the database and pairs it with the  **View**
 you intend to represent the data with.  
 
 **1. Create a proper Cursor from the Database.**

 In your Activity: 
 
 **2. Create a Custom Cursor Adapter.**

 Note: Extending from   assumes you use XML to create your views.
