*** cursor-rowcount-always-1-in-sqlite3-in-python3k ***

 I am trying to get the   of a     in my Python3k program, but I am puzzled, as the   is always  , despite what Python3 docs say (actually it is contradictory, it should be  ). Even after fetching all the rows,   stays at  . Is it a   bug? I have already checked if there are rows in the table. 
 I can get around this checking if a   returns something different than  , but I thought this issue would be nice to discuss. 
 Thanks. 
 
 From the  documentation : 
 
 As required by the Python DB API Spec,
  the rowcount attribute “is -1 in case
  no executeXX() has been performed on
  the cursor or the rowcount of the last
  operation is not determinable by the
  interface”. 
 **This includes **
** statements
  because we cannot determine the number
  of rows a query produced until all
  rows were fetched.**

 
 That means  **all**
   statements  **won't have a **
. The behaviour you're observing is documented.  
 **EDIT:**
 Documentation doesn't say anywhere that    **will**
 be updated after you do a   so it is just wrong to assume that. 
 
 
 The fetchall() will return a list of the rows returned from the select.  Len of that list will give you the rowcount. 
 
 Instead of "checking if a fetchone() returns something different than None", I suggest: 
 
 this is  -only (not supported in other DB API implementations) but very handy for  -specific Python code ( and  fully documented, see  http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html ). 
 
 May better count the rows this way: 
 
 
 Using PYCharm, in debug mode, if you put your cursor on your cursor variable, a small + will appear, when you click on it, you see different properties of your object. 
 In my cursor of 1 element, I see: 
 
 So, in your code, just use:
