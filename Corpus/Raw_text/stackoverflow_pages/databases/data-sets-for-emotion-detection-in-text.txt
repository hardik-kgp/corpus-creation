 I'm implementing a system that could detect the human emotion in text. Are there any manually annotated data sets available for supervised learning and testing?  
 Here are some interesting datasets:

 The field of textual emotion detection is still very new and the literature is fragmented in many different journals of different fields. Its really hard to get a good look on whats out there. 
 Note that there a several emotion theories psychology. Hence there a different ways of modeling/representing emotions in computing. Most of the times "emotion" refers to a phenomena such as anger, fear or joy. Other theories  state that all emotions can be represented in a multi-dimensional space (so there is an infinite number of them). 
 Here are a some (publicly available) data sets I know of (updated): 
 
 EmoBank. 10k sentences annotated with Valence, Arousal and Dominance values (disclosure: I am one of the authors).  https://github.com/JULIELab/EmoBank 
 The "Emotion Intensity in Tweets" data set from the WASSA 2017 shared task.  http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/EmotionIntensity-SharedTask.html

 If you want to go deeper into the topic, here are some surveys I recommend (disclosure: I authored the first one).
