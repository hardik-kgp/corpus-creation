*** data-viewer-for-appengine-development-server ***

 The Google AppEngine  development server  simulates Google's backend database with an embedded database. It creates a file on you local disk that you can delete to clear the DB.
Is there a tool that allows to browse and edit this data, similar to the Data Viewer that you get for deployed applications? 
 **Clarification**
: I am asking about the Java toolkit, not the Python one. 
 
 Finally, data viewer comes with Google App Engine Java SDK version 1.2.2.
It can be accessed at: 
 http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin 
 or 
 http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin 
 The same link as in Python version. 
 
 On my system (sdk 1.2.8 I think) the dev server runs on port 8888. So the data viewer is at  http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin 
 
 You can find it at  http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin . Looks bit different, but provides the same functionality (apart of  some bugs ). 
 But in the light of OP question amendment this answer is not relevant anymore.
