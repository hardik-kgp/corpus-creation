*** dataadapter-update-does-not-update-the-database ***

 I'm sure there is an extremely simple reason that this one line isn't working, but it has evaded for the past week, so I'm hoping someone else will notice my fault. 
 I have been working on this project for several weeks to a month. I have been using a mix of old DataAdapter, CommandBuiler, etc. with some linq to sql coding on 1 database, with multiple windows application forms. This particular form Edits or Deletes rows from the Database using a DataAdapter, Dataset, and Command Builder. It has been working fine, until I switched computers. Now the Dataset is being updated, but the Database is not. 
 Here is the full code of this form: 
 
 This is supposed to update the table: 
 
 I'm not getting any errors, but the data table just won't update. 
 Thanks in advance for your help, and just let me know if you need more information. 
 
 In order to update the data on the database your SqlDataAdapter need to have its InsertCommand, UpdateCommand, DeleteCommand properties set. The SqlCommandBuilder instance that you've created has these commands but you need to set them to your SqlDataAdapter. 
 In other worlds: Somewhere between

 What does the   for Update look like? I see the command but I don't see any SqlText, that's what you're missing.

 Adding AcceptChangesDuringUpdate before Update works for me, example :

 I had the same issue: Filled a new Dataset with some new rows, but nothing happened on update. I've used the MySqlDataAdapter which works similar. 
 It turns out that when you need the InsertCommand from the MySqlCommandBuilder you have to specify the rowstate as added. See also:  MSDN

 I have encountered the same problem. My dataadapter.fill works but dataadapter.update does not work. I realised the problem was that my database table does not contain a primary key. After I modified my table to include a column with primary key, dataadapter.fill works.
Hope this helps someone. 
 
 Check the properties of your Database If you are using Local-DB. 
 In "Copy to Output Directory" property set the value "Copy if newer" and you are good to go.
