*** database-based-priority-queue ***

 does anyone know of a good database based Priority Queue implementation? 
 I'm dealing with large amounts of data so keeping it all in memory is unfeasible. 
 Thanks! 
 
 Maybe you want a  Message Queue ? 
 There are several good ones, both proprietary and open source.  For a simple API, check  memcacheq , for a more complete, high-performace, take a look at  RabbitMQ
