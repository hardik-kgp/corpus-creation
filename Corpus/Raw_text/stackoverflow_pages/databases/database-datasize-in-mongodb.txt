 With following command, I can get the data size of a specific collection: 
 
 How do I get the datasize of a database?   
 
 Use following command at mongoshell: 
 
 Output should be like this: 
 
 See more diagnostic command  here . 
 
 Use db.getStats() in Java 
 
 Then will get result like below: 
 
 
 The  dbStats  command returns different storage statistics for a given database. 
As explained in  this post  about the different MongoDB performance metrics you should monitor (with MMAPv1), the   metric that you mentioned measures the space taken by all the documents and padding in the database. 
To get the "storage footprint" of you database on disk, you should look at the   metrics which corresponds to the size of your data files. It decreases only if you delete a database and is not affected when collections, documents, or indexes are removed. 
 Here is a diagram with the different important storage metrics returned by dbStats:
 
 Also note that, with the MMAPv1 storage engine, the mapped memory (  metric), corresponding to the quantity of virtual memory used to map the database into memory, gives you a good approximation of the total size of your database(s). You can access this metric with the  serverStatus command .
