 **Storing the transaction entry into a double entry accounting database.**

 I came up with two solutions option 1 and option 2, I was told most banking package chooses option 2 for their database design. However I prefer option 1 over option 2 because it simply makes sense and it is more efficient!  
 I.e For the 2 movement of funds, option 1 requires 2 records vs option 2 requires 4 records.  
 I would like to know why the bank would choose option 2 over option 1? what is the reason for this?  
 
 
 Option 1 will potentially be a bit more efficient from an insert perspective.  But since a lot of accounting transactions are going to affect more than two accounts, the benefit is likely to be substantially less than 2:1. 
 Option 2 will be clearer for these more complex transactions.  That is, an accountant would normally find three rows 
 
 Debit A $100  
 Credit B $60   
 Credit C $40 
 
 more clear than two rows 
 
 Debit A $60 Credit B $60 
 Debit A $40 Credit C $40 
 
 If you have multiple accounts on both sides, it would also be a bit unclear how to match up the debits and credits to a single account.  That is, 
 
 Debit A $100 
 Debit B $30 
 Credit C $60 
 Credit D $70 
 
 could be represented as  
 
 Debit A $60 Credit C $60 
 Debit A $40 Credit D $40 
 Debit B $30 Credit D $30 
 
 but there are also other possible ways to construct the data for data model 2.   
 Additionally, option 2 is going to be more efficient if you're trying to determine the current balance of a particular account by aggregating the transactions. 
 
 In a general accounting database design, it is logical and efficient to store your debits and credits in a single fields (i.e. option 2), as this would simplify aggregation,number manipulations and reporting. There should be a datetime field attached to each debit and credit transactions to filter out a particular period. Get the book from Smashwords, titled, accounting database design. It provides some good samples on accounting system design and some interesting sql query for financial reporting.
