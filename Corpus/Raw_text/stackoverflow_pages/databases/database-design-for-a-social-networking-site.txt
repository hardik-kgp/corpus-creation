 What are the Tables that would be present in a social networking site (ex: Twitter). 
 I have a users table as of now. How to keep track of followers and people I do follow? 
 
 Should I maintain a separate table for followers and people I follow? 
 What are the columns which would be there in those tables? 
 
 Please don't think this as Subjective/Off topic. As I am a beginner, I thought experts can guide me to get a good DB design? 
 
 Try having a look at  Database Answers  in particular the data models. They have several different designs for various systems. This  one  is for a social networking site which may give you an idea of what's required.  
 You may want to search on SO for other social network database questions. I found  this one  that had a link to  flickr  showing a schema which appears to be from Facebook.  
 Your database design will be based around your system requirements. Without knowing exactly what you are trying to achieve, it is difficult to give you the best design.

 You can create a separate table for follower/ followed  . So, when x follow y, create an entry with  .  
 You can query the relationship table to look for all the users x has relations with by   or vice versa.  
 When/if x un-follow y, you just have to delete the entry you originally created.
