*** database-design-for-comments-and-replies ***

 I want to create two tables one with comments and another with replies, with a one to many relationship between them. But what if they can also reply to replies, how should it be changed then? This is what I have for the one to many, but I don't know how it should look if there can also be replies for a reply. 
 
 Thanks in advance. 
 
 You could just use one table, which includes a ParentID field.  If the record has no value, it is a comment, otherwise it is a reply (to either a comment or a reply). 
 You could query the record's ParentID record (inspect  it's  ParentID) to see if this reply is to a comment or a reply. 
 **Edit**
: The above is a fairly practical solution.  However, to go with a normalised version, still keep the one Comments table (with no ParentID), and create a ReplyTo table which has a CommentID, and a ResponseID, both of which are the IDs of the records in the Comments table.  
 Using this idea, the following sql will show the comments and the 'reply' to each comment for each reply that has a comment: 
 
 As Dimitrii points out, it won't display comments with no replies - for this you need an outer join query (didn't test syntax):
