*** database-implementation-for-apps-like-instagram ***

 I'm wondering how do apps like snapchat and instagram store pictures and user records in database.  
 Say I have a user table, how would they maintain list of followers for each user? Would they store the list of followers for each entry in user table or make a separate table for follow event and make an entry every time someone follows someone. 
 Also, for storing pictures, I'm guessing they would dump the pictures in a mass storage server space and store the URL in tables. Is there a better way of implementing this? If not, what kind of mass storage server would they go for? Dedicated or shared servers? 
 Thanks.
