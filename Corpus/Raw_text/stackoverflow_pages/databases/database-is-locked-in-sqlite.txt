 you need to finalize the compiled statements and then close the database before opening it again. 
 
 
 The above answers are correct, however there is a way from which database show error of locked, if we are working or debugging on simulators. 
 Case 1: 
 Here I am explaining a scenario when I insert data into a table. And that database is accessing by any database browser and accessing from simulator. 
 Now when you are working on app via simulator, As you saved the data in database data saved. Now If you are using any browser for accessing data from that database and if you fire any update command in your browser and try to update any row it updates that row into a table. (Now as we try to delete anything from table it always shows an message that in browser read-only permissions are granted etc). 
 Now come on to simulator or If you run the app again
and when you try to insert any data in that table, It always show error 'Database is locked' because the permissions are of read-only and we tempered those permissions. Now If you try to change commands as mentioned in answers you will always get sadness. It always show an error of database is locked (As I tried few times to solve this but every time I failed). 
 There is only a way to remove from that situation is: remove app from your simulator and reinstall it.
And avoid to update/insert any row from browser. 
 Another Answer is:
Case 2: 
 As you are working on sqlite browser and make any updations from it, make sure you have saved your all changes other wise locked condition happens.
