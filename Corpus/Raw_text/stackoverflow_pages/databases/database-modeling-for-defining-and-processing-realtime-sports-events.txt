*** database-modeling-for-defining-and-processing-realtime-sports-events ***

 I am trying to store and process sports events in realtime and want to create an optimal system as this will process 100s of events per second. The system will store the events before a sports match and then process them in real-time or at end of a half/session/match. 
 In my system, every   is broken down into following components 
 
  whom is the event related to. A team, player, refree,
spectators, etc  
   what is the event (goal, pass, save, etc) 
   time details of the event  
  how is the event value defined 
  defines when should it be checked -   : realtime,
  : end of  
 
 Here are some examples for soccer 
 
 All   events will be checked when the state of the match changes. e.g. IInd half ---> MATCH_END 
 All   events will be checked for in real-time (as soon as a new event is received). This works on web hook. 
 E.g. A goal is scored in the 58th minute. 
Event received by system -  
 The system would now run a  "find" where   and compare all the events found. 
 Later on, I would like to provide an admin functionality for writing sentences which can be parsed into this structure. What I want to know is if I am working in the right direction or do I need to start thinking in a different way.  
 
 Your choices are probably between Spark and Dataflow. Here's a nice  white paper comparing the two  that actually uses a similar use case to yours (large scale mobile game user scoring in real time). Good luck, seems like a cool project (looks like an online bookmaking implementation?).
