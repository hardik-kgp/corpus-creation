*** database-querying-with-google-dart ***

 I went through the documentation and did not find anything related to databases. 
 I guess this is not yet natively possible -- if not, then are there any libraries that utilize e.g. the Socket class to make it possible to connect to a database? 
 To be more specific, I'd like to connect to a MySQL and a MongoDB databases. 
 
 sqljocky is a  MySQL driver for Dart . 
 
 I found  MongoDart  to be the first library to give MongoDB access to Dart. 
 Here's an example: 
 
 
 There is also a  postgresql package  on pub. 
 
 for sql server i use a restfull client using asp.net webservices to call sql querys and return results in json. 
 I use a authentication in webservices and encrypt query in client and server. I don't know if this is a best option but work for all databases.
