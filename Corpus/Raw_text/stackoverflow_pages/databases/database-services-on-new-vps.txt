*** database-services-on-new-vps ***

 There are services like ServerPilot and many others that install on a vps that handle the lamp stack env. I'm wondering if there is a service that does this for databases. I install the service on a fresh vps and that the service would do all the heavy lifting like security, replication, separate read writes, back-ups and monitoring a long with easily setting up private network access for a set fee to use that service on my server. 
 Looking for a simple service to install on my own fresh vps, not RDS or Google Cloud. 
 Thank you! 
 
 **What Does ServerPilot Really Do?**

 First, ServerPilot deploys complete LAMP stack on your server and that’s including world’s most used web server Apache, PHP5, and MYSQL. To make it even super, ServerPilot also installs and configures Nginx in front of Apache to achieve unbeatable speed and scalability. 
 Secondly, ServerPilot will secure your server with a firewall. To make it even secure, it will also update your server’s packages and make sure they stay updated all the time to avoid even single bug caused by outdated package. 
 Thirdly, ServerPilot also offers a premium feature to monitor real-time stats of your server’s performance including CPU, memory, disk space, and more. 
 **What Does ServerPilot Not Do?**

 Meanwhile Serverpilot does not provide features related to installing, configuring and managing email and DNS. In this case you may need third-party DNS server to be able to point your domain to your VPS. Need recommendations? Try CloudFlare, PointHQ, NameCheap, etc. 
 Also, ServerPilot does not manage your server running other than Ubuntu.

 I'm not sure about services, but assuming that your VPS is Ubuntu or some other Debian-based distro, you could perform   on the command line to get your LAMP stack setup. This will setup Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL on your Linux server. Apache and PHP will come working out-of-the-box, and when you install MySQL, by default it asks for a root password to manage the database. 
 phpMyAdmin would be the key here because instead of doing all your database tasks via the command line, it provides a GUI interface in your web browser to manage databases and tables. To backup your database with phpMyAdmin, see  this article . 
 With regards to customizations, for the firewall you can simply write a few iptables rules and for the database, you can run scheduled backups of a MySQL database by creating a cron job that runs the following command: 
 Again, this isn't a service, but at least you wouldn't have to pay for any of the tools. 
 
 Unfortunately, there is no ultimate service than can perform all this stuff. However, you can set up this manually:
