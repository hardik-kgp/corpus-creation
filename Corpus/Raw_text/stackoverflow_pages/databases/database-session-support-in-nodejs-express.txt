*** database-session-support-in-nodejs-express ***

 Does expressjs/nodejs have support (via a module?) for database sessions? I come from the world of PHP/CodeIgniter and I've enjoyed the features of storing session data in a mysql database table. 
 Is this approach used with nodejs web apps? 
 
 Yes.
