 It is really a pain keeping production and development databases in sync manually. 
 Is there any tool that allows one to keep the two databases in sync? Something like the amazing  Laravel framework's migrations  thing? 
 I am using MySQL and PHP. I searched here and there but wasn't able to spot the right tool for the job. 
 
 You should definitely have a look at  phinx . Here's an example of a complex database migration step I performed using MySQL and PHP:  https://coderwall.com/p/v3qg2q 
 
 If I am not wrong you need a tool to create database version control to keep track of schema changes. You may use Cygnite Migration commands. It is simple to use and make your job easier. 
 For your reference-

 Database migration tool 
 
 Check out Schematic, It's designed to work with schema files in YAML or JSON, and it can be installed globally:

 And it's designed to be committed with your VCS so your database versions are stored with your project commits. 
 
 It's not clear exactly what you want ... 
 
 one way from prod to dev? 
 data or ddl or both? 
 
 take a look at this thread:   How to synchronize development and production database 
 
 Try to use rubyrep  http://www.rubyrep.org/ . It can continuously replicate between two databases. 
 
 If you just want the two DBs to be identical, why not use MySQL replication with your production as the master and the dev server as the slave. 
 MySQL Replication Docs 
 
 **1 .**
 make your remote or production database accept remote connection using a wild card or special Ip address ! through some sort of cpanel or config file !  
 **2 .**
 you can extend the db artisan command like "db:sync". 
 **3 .**
 command code (not tested yet) : 
 
 I did no add any function check as usually it's intended to work. 
 
 You can for example instead of a command, add some automation using events, cron job, listeners ... there's many options, but the main logic part trick is :  Defining environment variable names for your 2 db connections, and in the app config database.php, define your connections credentials etc, and finally make use of the exec, mysqldump & mysql. 
 
 Good luck
