 When naming tables and schema of the db is it best to use singular or plural.
For example. should it be Customers or Customer? 
 And when naming should it be Capital such as Customer or customer? Any best practice regarding naming? 
 
 This question calls for a religious war. 
 I have no doubt it should be plural because... 
 
 A table is a collection of rows. 
 The SQL syntax becomes more natural -   instead of  . 
 The analogy to OOP - you have a class   and a list or other collection of customers called  . 
  -   refers to the whole table while   refers to the current row. 
 
 **Negative things**

 One has to switch several times between singular and  plural during the development. You may start with a conceptual model - for example an entity relationship model - where the natural choice is to name the entity  . From this model you generate a database and must pluralize the name to get the   table. Finally you pick your favourit O/R mapper and it has to singularize the name again to get a class named  . 
 If you have to do this manually because the tool is lacking support (for example EntityFramework prior to .NET 4.0) it might be a reasonable choice to keep the table names singular but therfore get a class   instead of   without changing it by hand. 
 
 singular naming. 
 it's all about the tuples, not the tables, and a tuple is one customer, not customers. also i prefer naming in lower cases, but thats for no reason, i just learned it like that in school. 
 in the end, as others said, it's more a matter of preference. more important than the choice if to use plural or singular is to stay consistend and do it the same way for all tables - if you mix pluar and singular naming, it's a real mess. 
 
 It's pretty much a matter of preference 
 
 Do you select a   or a  ? 
 ...or do you select an   from   instead of an   from  . 
 Do you select a   list, or a   list? 
 ...or do you select an   list from   instead of an   list from  ? 
 I think consistency is more important that the convention itself.  Personally, I prefer singular, lower case table names, but I'm not going to vehemently defend that choice. 
 
 My choice are Singular and TitleCase :) 
 Customer is an entity. Table is the logical collection of multiple entity. So plural is preferred. 
 For table names pascal case is better. i.e., CustomerMaster.  
 It is preferred to use prefix such as tblCustomerMaster.  
 If you are using group name as prefix then use it in capital letters like,
NEWCustomer, OLDCustomer
