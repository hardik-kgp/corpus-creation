*** database-that-consumes-less-disk-space ***

 I'm looking at solutions to store a massive quantity of information consuming the less possible disk space. 
 The information structure is very simple and the queries will also be very simple.
I've looked at solutions like Apache Cassandra and relations databases but couldn't find a comparison where disk usage is mentioned. 
 Any ideas on this would be great. 
 
 Take a  look  at Oracle Berkeley DB - very simple robust  database (key/value): 
 "Berkeley DB enables the development of custom data management solutions, without the overhead traditionally associated with such custom projects. Berkeley DB provides a collection of well-proven building-block technologies that can be configured to address any application need from the handheld device to the datacenter, from a local storage solution to a world-wide distributed one, from kilobytes to petabytes." 
 
 Speaking about Apache Cassandra - it's just a disk space hog. 200 MB of logs resulted in 1.2 GB files produced by Cassandra - and the keyspace was just 4 columns with 200 length strings. 
 
 Redis  might worth a check if you can store your data in key-value 
 
 Newest version of Microsoft's SQL Server (2008) supports several levels of compression (row compression and page compression, in addition to backup compression). Might be worth investigating. 
 Some relevant resources:
