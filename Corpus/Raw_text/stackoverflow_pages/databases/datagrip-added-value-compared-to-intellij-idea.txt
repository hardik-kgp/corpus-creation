*** datagrip-added-value-compared-to-intellij-idea ***

 So, I was wondering if there is really some new features coming from JetBrains  DataGrip  software. 
 So far, I didn't find anything that is not already there in IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate). I didn't spend much time using it though. 
 
 In 2016.3 there's a feature that is DataGrip specific 
 
 Tracking database changes 
 If there are lots of changes in many places, you can see all of them
  from the Database Changes window. Important! This window is available
  only in DataGrip, but not in other IntelliJ-based IDE's.

 I am Max, the PMM of DataGrip. 
 We usually say that DataGrip provides the same functionality as all the other IDE's from JetBrains with the database support. As mentioned above, DataGrip provides better user experience as a standalone IDE. 
 OBSOLETTE: 
 Indeed, DataBase changes is the toolwindow which is available only in DataGrip. It lets you look at changes you are going to apply to source codes of various objects like views, procs etc.
It is a minor difference, that's why we say "the same" to keep things simple. 
 
 From FAQ part from this  blog . 
 
 Does DataGrip repeat the functionality of the database tools in other JetBrains IDEs? 
 Yes, the first version focuses on that core functionality.

 This repeats the functionality in Intellij, but does it add any more features over and above Intellij? If they are equal right now, will that always be the case? Would be nice to see a feature comparison chart.

 The latest version of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate includes the functionality of DataGrip 1.0. Still,  **DataGrip is focused on working with databases and SQL and thus may provide better user experience as a standalone IDE**
