 I am creating an app that needs all available US automotive make/models for each year. I have read several suggestions on other posts, like use Freebase or DbPedia or EPA, but those datasets all appear rather incomplete and inconsistent. I checked out open APIs like Edmond's, but they restrict storing their data - I need it in my db, so that doesn't work. Any suggestions where I can get this data without having to shell out money? 
 
 Apparently there is not much out there. And a lot of doubt that someone would be willing to provide such a repository. So I solved the problem myself, and am sharing my dataset with anyone else who finds themselves facing the same problem.

 These guys have an API that will give the results.  It's also free to use.

 Note: they also provide data source download in xls or sql format at a premium price. but these data also provides technical specifications for all the make model and trim options. 
 
 How about Freebase? I think they have an API available, too.
