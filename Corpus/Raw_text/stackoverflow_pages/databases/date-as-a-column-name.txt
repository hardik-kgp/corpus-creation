*** date-as-a-column-name ***

 I have a table called calendars. 
 One of its columns is named 'date' 
 When I want to select the date column it gives error ORA-01747 namely invalid table.column. 
 
 I guess this happens because 'date' is a reserved word for pl/sql. The problem is it's not even possible to change the column name : 
 
 Result is:  ORA-00904 error: invalid identifier. 
 What do you advice? 
 Thanks. 
 
 Have you tried 
 
 If that doesn't work or help, have you tried dropping the column (and maybe try referencing it with the table name prefix:  )?

 Try escaping the reserved word with double quotes. 
 
 
 date is a reserved keyword and hence cannot be used like 
 SELECT date from some table 
 there can be multiple solutions for the problem 
 
 The date column needs to be enclosed within the brackets like 
 
 
 SELECT [date] FROM tableName 
 
 
 Enclose the reserved keyword in  backticks 
 
 
 SELECT 'date' from tableName 
 
 
 Use alias  
 
 
 SELECT tableName.date from tableName
