*** db-schema-compare-error-version-store-out-of-memory ***

 Below is an error that I have been receiving while doing a schema compare in Visual Studio 2013 Professional w/ Update 3. I am using version 2008 R2 DB server and I am utilizing SSMS 2014. 
 This error was persistent for a couple weeks continually popping up more and more frequently. So I reformatted my machine...   guess what..  once everything was setup again, I received the error again! 
 Please help me understand what I can do to resolve this issue. Thank you! 
 
 
 
 I've searched for solutions myself and never found anything helpful online.  After doing some experimenting I found one setting change that allows me to compare and compile my very stubborn projects.  I went into the properties of the SqlProj project, down to the "SQLCLR Build" tab and clicked on the "Advanced..." button.  In the Output section I changed the "Debug Info" dropdown to be "pdb-only".  That improved it for me quite a bit, but I still get the occasional crash.   
 
 I have regularly seen this problem in our database builds within TeamCity.  Following advice from this article  https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/749108/msbuild-fails-randomly-with-version-store-out-of-memory-cleanup-already-attempted-errors-msb4018  I have since configured the MSBuild command with the additional parameter  **/p:CmdLineInMemoryStorage=true**
.
The build process does appear to be more reliable now.
