*** dbvisualizer-set-max-rows-in-a-select-query ***

 I am using DBVisualizer 8.0.6 and when I run a simply query like.... 
 
 It only shows the first 1000 rows and then stops the query and displays in the bottom left corner...
"Number of rows limited by maxrows" 
 How do I change this #?  I'm writing a query which needs to export a little over 1000 rows but dbvisualizer has this set limit... 
 I tried something like
@set maxrows 2000
then commit
then run my query. Still returns only 1000 rows.  This is for an Oracle table.   
 
 There is a box in SQL Commander labeled Max Rows.  Set it to   for the complete result set. 
 
 
 Or you could just export directly to a file. This will allow to export many more rows than the DBVisualizer GUI can show you. When having to export a few million records (should you ever need that), this is quite useful. 
 Simply do something like this in your SQL Commander: 
 
 You can find more about this (and the various parameters) here:

 so apparently you need to have DBVisualizer Personal edition to set the maxrows, which the free edition doesn't support.  You can get a free trial though.  Then you can run something like... 
 
 If anyone knows how to do this in the free version please feel free to comment, thanks. 
 
 From  this page , it looks as though the maximum number of rows returned initially is specified within the Tool Properties dialog, on the General Settings tab, on the Table Data node in the Max Rows at First Display property. 
 
  would return 9 records for oracle.  
 But It varies db to db .  
 Sql server uses  .  
 For MySQL syntax changes as  
 Maybe Some others use take , skip, etc... So using dbvisualizer , and its setting in the accepted answer is logical for cross db users. It doesn't bother you by varied sql syntax.
