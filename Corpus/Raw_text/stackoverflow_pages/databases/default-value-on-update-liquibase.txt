*** default-value-on-update-liquibase ***

 I am using Liquibase for generating a MySQL and a HSQLDB databases.   In several tables I have a column called 'last_modified' which is the TIMESTAMP of the last update on that particular record.  
 
 I noticed that if I use MySQL, the generated SQL for that column is:  
 
 While if I use HSQLDB, in case of update nothing happens, but I would like to have the same behaviour of the MySQL database with a default value on update equals to the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.    
How can I set the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as a default value ON UPDATE?  
 
 You can't do this with a default value. The MySQL behaviour is non-standard and not supported by other databases. The proper way to do this is with a TRIGGER which is defined as BEFORE UPDATE and sets the timestamp each time the row is updated. 
 Update: From HSQLDB version 2.3.4 this feature is supported. For example:  . Note the NOT NULL constraint must appear after the DEFAULT and ON UPDATE clauses. 
 
 Or you could try this, as you have already have   tag added: 
 
 Liquibase 3.1.1 does not produce what you described above. I have to deal with it as given above 
 
 we actually use Liquibase for the exact same use-case. You'll want to make an update trigger as fredt described. Otherwise, you can't be sure the update will occur on other databases besides MySQL. Your changeset tag will log something like this: 
 
 Also, I have a question on Stack Overflow about how to refactor some of this code you can see at  How do you refactor similar looking code and provide params in Liquibase? .
