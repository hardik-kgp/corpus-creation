*** defining-a-foreign-key-constraint-in-h2-databases ***

 I am new in coding so I made a tables in SQL server and it worked, so i used the same command in H2 and it said I have  a syntax problems with the second table, someone can help? 
 
 The error is 
 
 
 Two-step process 
 
 Create the table without a foreign key 
 
 
 
 Add the foreign key constraint 
 
 
 One-step process 
 
 
 I would add one option to @david-brossard's answer: 
 
 By using a  Constaint Name Definition  the foreign key is named explicitly, otherwise H2 assigns it a name based on it's own naming scheme e.g.  CONSTRAINT_74. 
 I feel this makes it safer to manage the constraint later by avoiding ambiguity on use of the name and referencing the name directly defined previously e.g. 
 
 I have started doing this as standard, based on my use of Flyway for an installable software product.  
 In theory the sequence of Flyway migrations should result in constraints (including Foreign Keys) being applied in the same order and therefore H2 should assign the same name in each copy of database. However, the worry point is removed if a direct name is assigned - one which is referenced in previous migration scripts - rather than one deduced from checking the assigned name in a single database instance. 
 
 I would improve on @david-brossard's answer: 
 
 When you define the   in this case you can omit to reference explicitly the   column because H2 knows what column is the primary key in  .
