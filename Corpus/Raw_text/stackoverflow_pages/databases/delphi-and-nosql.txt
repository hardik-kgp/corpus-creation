*** delphi-and-nosql ***

 Have anyone ever used Delphi with NoSQL databases like Mongo, CouchDB or others? Which one would you recommend? 
 
 For Mongo, theres  TMongoWire  and  pebongo  (early stages). For couchDB, I believe one would interact mainly through HTTP/JSON
For Cassandra, I believe the best bet would be to somehow incorporate a supported language inside your Delphi app and use that to interact with Cassandra, or else implement a web service in a supported language and make it accessible to your Delphi application. 
 Hope it helps. 
 
 There is a new full featured driver for MongoDB "mongo-delphi-driver" which can be found (with examples) here:   https://github.com/gerald-lindsly/mongo-delphi-driver . 
 
 Delphi has few native NoSQL database solutions right-out-of-the-box: 
 
 BDE & Paradox & dBase through the TDatabase & TTable API; 
 TClientDataSet. 
 
 Not that I suggest them, but you have not listed your requirements.
