*** difference-between-a-statement-and-a-query-in-sql ***

 I still live in this ambiguity: conceptually what's the difference between a  **statement**
 and a  **query**
 in SQL? Can anybody give a definition for each of them? It would be useful, for example when choosing variables names inside programs in a way that will be clear for everybody.
Thanks! 
 **ADDITIONALLY:**
 How can I call a chunk of SQL code made by more than one statement where statements are separated by a semicolon ( )? Who already replied can edit his answer. Many thanks! 
 
 A  statement  is any text that the database engine recognizes as a valid command. As of  : 
 
 An SQL-statement is a string of characters that conforms to the format and syntax rules specified in this international standard. 
 
 A  query  is a statement that returns a recordset (possibly empty).

 A series of   statements sent to the server at once is called a  batch . 
 Not all   engines required the statements in a batch to be semicolon delimited.  , for instance, generally does not and breaks the statements based on context.   statements starting with   are a notable exception. 
 
 A  **statement**
 is any SQL command such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. 
 A  **query**
 is a synonym for a SELECT statement. 
 
 From  Wikipedia - SQL Language Elements 
 
 The SQL language is sub-divided into several language elements, including: 
 
 Clauses , which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)[9] 
 Expressions , which can produce either scalar values or tables consisting of columns and rows of data. 
 Predicates , which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) or Boolean (true/false/unknown) truth values and which are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow. 
 **Queries**
, which retrieve data based on specific criteria. 
 **Statements**
, which may have a persistent effect on schemas and data, or which may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics. 
  
   
 SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar. 
 
 Insignificant whitespace  is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability. 
 
 
 
 A  statement  is the general term for a piece of complete, correct SQL that you can send to a DBMS. A  query  is a statement that will return data, thus a query is a special kind of statement. 
 A   would be a query, a   just a statement. 
 
 They're used interchangeably by most, but some often use the word "query" to mean, specifically,   statements, because when you  query  something or someone, you want information. And   queries return result sets, so that'd fit the description nicely. This also is evident in the fact that   statements are formally called DQL (Data Query Language) statements. 
 
 **Queries**
 is used for retrieve data based on specific criteria, but  **statement**
 may have a persistent effect on schemas and data, or which may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics. See also  Wikipedia .
