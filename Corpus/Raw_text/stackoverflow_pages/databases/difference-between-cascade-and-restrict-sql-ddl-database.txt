*** difference-between-cascade-and-restrict-sql-ddl-database ***

 Could anyone tell me what exactly cascade, and restrict mean?
It's in database systems subject the DDL Part 
 and what if i don't write any of them in my delete statement? 
 
 The ON DELETE CASCADE and ON DELETE RESTRICT are the foreign key property and you set them when you are creating the relationship between two tables. 
 If you set the relationship to be ON DELETE CASCADE, when you run a DELETE statement on a parent table it will DELETE all the corresponding rows from the CHILD table automatically. But the RESTRICT (which is the default foreign key relationship behavior) is when you try to delete a row from the parent table and there is a row in the child table with the same ID, it will fail complaining about the existing child rows. 
 Either way, you don't need to mention anything in your DELETE clause. 
 I also wrote a blog post about the different rules for Delete and Update commands in more detail here: 
 https://koukia.ca/sql-server-foreign-key-update-and-delete-rules-556cf09117fe 
 
 There are three types of on delete associated with foreign key 
 
 On Delete Cascade: when data is removed from a parent table, automatically data deleted from child table (foreign key table). 
 On Delete set Null: when data is removed from a parent table, the foreign key associated cell will be null in a child table. 
 On Delete Restrict: when data is removed from a parent table, and there is a foreign key associated with child table it gives error, you can not delete the record. 
 
 
 Right so these ON DELETE and ON UPDATE apply to the parent table/row. The reason NO ACTION and RESTRICT are the same thing is because you cannot have a relationship with a child and a parent if the parent doesn't exist.
