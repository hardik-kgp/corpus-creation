 What are the differences between all of the different types of SQL? I hear of PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, SQL, .... What are the differences between them? 
 
 
 **SQL**
 is Structured Query Language is a
  database computer language designed
  for managing data in relational
  database management systems (RDBMS). 
 **PostgreSQL**
 is an object-relational
  database management system
  (ORDBMS). 1  It is released under a
  BSD-style license and is thus free
  software. As with many other
  open-source programs, PostgreSQL is
  not controlled by any single company,
  but has a global community of
  developers and companies to develop
  it. 
 **SQLite**
 is an ACID-compliant embedded
  relational database management system
  contained in a relatively small (~225
  KB 1 ) C programming library. The
  source code for SQLite is in the
  public domain. 
 **MySQL**
 (pronounced /maɪˌɛskjuːˈɛl/ 1 
  My S-Q-L, or "My sequel"
  /maɪˈsiːkwəl/) is a relational
  database management system (RDBMS) 2 
  which has more than 6 million
  installations.  3  MySQL stands for
  "My Structured Query Language". The
  program runs as a server providing
  multi-user access to a number of
  databases. 
 
 
 PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, MS SQL are just  database management systems  from  **different vendors**

 
 If you want to know about different dialects of  SQL  ( Structured Query Language )
  Have a look here :

 Comparison of relational database management systems 
 
 PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, MSSQL, Sybase = relational database management systems (RDBMSes). 
 SQL, TSQL = the actual languages used by the aforementioned database systems. Although (in theory) SQL is standardised, in practice each vendor has their own "extensions" (variations) on the language - which means that SQL written for MySQL may not work under Sybase, for example. 
 
 Different Vendors= Different Ideas and Concepts.
Like every other Programming Problem...every developer solutes it differently and thats great. :-)
Learing about this little differences or sometimes big "Messed up" is good.
