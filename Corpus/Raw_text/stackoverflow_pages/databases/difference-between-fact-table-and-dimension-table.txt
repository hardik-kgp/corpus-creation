*** difference-between-fact-table-and-dimension-table ***

 When reading a book for business objects, I came across the term- fact table and dimension table.  
 I am trying to understand what is the different between Dimension table and Fact table? 
 I read couple of articles on the internet but I was not able to understand clearly.. 
 Any simple example will help me to understand better? 
 
 This is to answer the part:  
 
 I was trying to understand whether dimension tables can be fact table
  as well or not? 
 
 The short answer (INMO) is No.That is because the 2 types of tables are created for different reasons. However, from a database design perspective, a dimension table could have a parent table as the case with the fact table which always has a dimension table (or more) as a parent. Also, fact tables may be aggregated, whereas Dimension tables are not aggregated. Another reason is that fact tables are not supposed to be updated in place whereas Dimension tables could be updated in place in some cases. 
 More details: 
 Fact and dimension tables appear in a what is commonly known as a Star Schema. A primary purpose of star schema is to simplify a complex normalized set of tables and consolidate data (possibly from different systems) into one database structure that can be queried in a very efficient way. 
 On its simplest form, it contains a fact table (Example: StoreSales) and a one or more dimension tables. Each Dimension entry has 0,1 or more fact tables associated with it (Example of dimension tables: Geography, Item, Supplier, Customer, Time, etc.). It would be valid also for the dimension to have a parent, in which case the model is of type "Snow Flake". However, designers attempt to avoid this kind of design since it causes more joins that slow performance. In the example of StoreSales, The Geography dimension could be composed of the columns (GeoID, ContenentName, CountryName, StateProvName, CityName, StartDate, EndDate)  
 In a Snow Flakes model, you could have 2 normalized tables for Geo information, namely: Content Table, Country Table. 
 You can find plenty of examples on Star Schema. Also, check this out to see an alternative view on the star schema model  Inmon vs. Kimball . Kimbal has a good forum you may also want to check out here:  Kimball Forum . 
 Edit: To answer comment about examples for 4NF: 
 
 Example for a fact table violating 4NF: 
 
 Sales Fact (ID, BranchID, SalesPersonID, ItemID, Amount, TimeID) 
 
 Example for a fact table not violating 4NF: 
 
 AggregatedSales (BranchID, TotalAmount) 
 Here the relation is in 4NF 
 The last example is rather uncommon. 
 
 In Data Warehouse Modeling, a  **star schema**
 and a  **snowflake schema**
 consists of  **Fact**
 and  **Dimension**
 tables.  
 **Fact Table:**

 
 It contains all the primary keys of the dimension and associated
facts or measures(is a property on which calculations can be made) like  quantity sold, amount sold and average sales. 
 
 **Dimension Tables:**
  
 
 Dimension tables provides descriptive information for all the measurements recorded in fact table. 
 Dimensions are relatively very small as comparison of fact table. 
 Commonly used dimensions are people, products, place and time.

 This appears to be a very simple answer on how to differentiate between fact and dimension tables! 
 
 It may help to think of dimensions as things or objects. A thing such
  as a product can exist without ever being involved in a business
  event. A dimension is your noun. It is something that can exist
  independent of a business event, such as a sale. Products, employees,
  equipment, are all things that exist. A dimension either does
  something, or has something done to it. 
 Employees sell, customers buy. Employees and customers are examples of
  dimensions, they do. 
 Products are sold, they are also dimensions as they have something
  done to them. 
 Facts, are the verb. An entry in a fact table marks a discrete event
  that happens to something from the dimension table. A product sale
  would be recorded in a fact table. The event of the sale would be
  noted by what product was sold, which employee sold it, and which
  customer bought it. Product, Employee, and Customer are all dimensions
  that describe the event, the sale. 
 In addition fact tables also typically have some kind of quantitative
  data. The quantity sold, the price per item, total price, and so on.

 I found this answer easier to understand from the perspective of a person who does not know much of the DB/DW terminology.

 I'll recommend going through this first and then going through Emmad Kareem's answer for more granularity. Hope it's helpful. 
 
 Super simple explanation: 
 Fact table: a data table that maps lookup IDs together. Is usually one of the main tables central to your application.  
 Dimension table: a lookup table used to store values (such as city names or states) that are repeated frequently in the fact table. 
 
 
 The fact table mainly consists of business facts and foreign keys that refer to primary keys in the dimension tables. A dimension table consists mainly of descriptive attributes that are textual fields. 
 A dimension table contains a surrogate key, natural key, and a set of attributes. On the contrary, a fact table contains a foreign key, measurements, and degenerated dimensions. 
 Dimension tables provide descriptive or contextual information for the measurement of a fact table. On the other hand, fact tables provide the measurements of an enterprise. 
 When comparing the size of the two tables, a fact table is bigger than a dimensional table. In a comparison table, more dimensions are presented than the fact tables. In a fact table, less numbers of facts are observed. 
 The dimension table has to be loaded first. While loading the fact tables, one should have to look at the dimension table. This is because the fact table has measures, facts, and foreign keys that are the primary keys in the dimension table.

 In the simplest form, I think a dimension table is something like a 'Master' table - that keeps a list of all 'items', so to say. 
 A fact table is a transaction table which describes all the transactions. In addition, aggregated (grouped) data like total sales by sales person, total sales by branch - such kinds of tables also might exist as independent fact tables. 
 
 **Dimension table**

Dimension table is a table which contain attributes of measurements stored in fact tables. This table consists of hierarchies, categories and logic that can be used to traverse in nodes. 
 **Fact table**
 contains the measurement of business processes, and it contains foreign keys for the dimension tables. 
 Example – If the business process is manufacturing of bricks 
 Average number of bricks produced by one person/machine – measure of the business process 
 
 Dimension table : It is nothing but we can maintains information about the characterized date  called as Dimension table.  
 Example : Time Dimension , Product Dimension. 
 Fact Table : It is nothing but we can maintains information about the metrics or precalculation data. 
 Example : Sales Fact, Order Fact. 
 Star schema : one fact table link with dimension table form as a Start Schema.
