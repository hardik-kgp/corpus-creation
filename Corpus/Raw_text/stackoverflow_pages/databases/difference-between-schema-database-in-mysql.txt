*** difference-between-schema-database-in-mysql ***

 Is there a difference between a schema and a database in MySQL?  In SQL Server, a database is a higher level container in relation to a schema. 
 I read that   and   do essentially the same thing in MySQL, which leads me to believe that schemas and databases are different words for the same objects. 
 
 As defined in the  MySQL Glossary : 
 
 In MySQL, physically, a  **schema**
 is synonymous with a  **database**
. You can substitute the keyword   instead of   in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using   instead of  . 
 Some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a  **schema**
 represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user. 
 
 
 Depends on the database server.   doesn't care, its basically the same thing. 
 ,  , and other enterprise level database solutions make a distinction. Usually a  **schema is a collection of tables**
 and a  **Database is a collection of schemas.**

 
 Refering to  MySql documentation , 
 
 CREATE DATABASE creates a database with the given name. To use this
  statement, you need the CREATE privilege for the database. CREATE
  SCHEMA is a synonym for CREATE DATABASE as of MySQL 5.0.2. 
 
 
 PostgreSQL supports schemas, which is a subset of a database:
 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-schemas.html 
 
 A database contains one or more named schemas, which in turn contain
  tables. Schemas also contain other kinds of named objects, including
  data types, functions, and operators. The same object name can be used
  in different schemas without conflict; for example, both schema1 and
  myschema can contain tables named mytable. Unlike databases, schemas
  are not rigidly separated: a user can access objects in any of the
  schemas in the database they are connected to, if they have privileges
  to do so. 
 
 Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level, except that schemas cannot be nested. 
 In my humble opinion, MySQL is not a reference database. You should never quote MySQL for an explanation. MySQL implements non-standard SQL and sometimes claims features that it does not support. For example, in MySQL, CREATE schema will only create a DATABASE. It is truely misleading users. 
 This kind of vocabulary is called "MySQLism" by DBAs. 
 
 Yes, people use these terms interchangeably with regard to MySQL.  Though oftentimes you will hear people inappropriately refer to the entire database server as the database. 
 
 in MySQL  **schema**
 is synonym of  **database**
. 
Its quite confusing for beginner people who jump to MySQL and very first day find the word  schema , so guys nothing to worry as both are same. 
 When you are starting MySQL for the first time you need to create a database (like any other database system) to work with so you can  **CREATE SCHEMA**
 which is nothing but  **CREATE DATABASE**

 In some other database system schema represents a part of database or a collection of Tables, and collection of schema is a database. 
 
 Microsoft SQL Server for instance, Schemas refer to a single user and is another level of a container in the order of indicating the server, database, schema, tables, and objects. 
 For example, when you are intending to update dbo.table_a and the syntax isn't full qualified such as 
UPDATE table.a the DBMS can't decide to use the intended table. Essentially by default the DBMS will utilize myuser.table_a
