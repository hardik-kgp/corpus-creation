*** difference-between-sparse-index-and-dense-index ***

 I am very confused to understand the difference between sparse index and dense index. Can you explain the difference between them ? 
 
 As described in this  link 
 
 Dense Index: 
 
 An index record appears for every search key value in file.  
 This record contains search key value and a pointer to the actual record. 
 
 Sparse Index: 
 
 Index records are created only for some of the records. 
 To locate a record, we find the index record with the largest search key value less than or equal to the search key value we are looking
  for. 
 We start at that record pointed to by the index record, and proceed along the pointers in the file (that is, sequentially) until we find
  the desired record. 
 
 
 Also,  **dense indices**
 are  faster  in general, but  **sparse indices**
  require less space  and impose  less maintenance  for insertions and deletions 
 
 In Dense Index, an index entry appears for every search-key whereas for Sparse index, an index entry appears for only some of the search-key values.
