*** differences-between-sqlite-sql-and-mysql-and-learning-tips ***

 I have quite done with my web-programming skills and now i thought of learning database languages.  
 But I am confuse with the difference between  ,   and  .  
 So can anyone recommend me the steps of learning database with above languages(zero knowledge). 
 
 Start to learn one engine and I recommend (Microsoft) SQL Server, and the conversion will be easy. 
 But it is important to note that SQL Server and MySQL support stored procedures but SQLite does not. 
 SQLite is file-based, SQL Server and MySQL are server-based 
 
 SQL is query language. MySQL is client-server relational database management system (RDBMS). Sqlite is embeddable relational database management system. 
 
 **SQL**
 - Structured Query Language - (To query database) 
 **MySQL**
 - Client Server Database - (Uses SQL to manage data, Has User Interface (UI)) 
 **SQLite**
 - Small version of MySQL - (for battery operated devices) 
 More : 
 **SQLite:**

 
 easier to setup 
 great for temporary (testing databases) 
 great for rapid development 
 great for embedding in an application 
 doesn't have user management 
 doesn't have many performance features 
 doesn't scale well. 
 
 **MySQL:**

 
 far more difficult/complex to set up 
 better options for performance tuning 
 can scale well if tuned properly 
 can manage users, permissions, etc. 
 
 
 I best recommend to use MySQL first for you to become more familiar on its basic functionality which I suppose  you must learn first. 
 
 This SO link  as a very detailed comparison of MySQL vs SQLite. As @Andrey pointed out, SQL is a query  language . Your best bet would be to follow any tutorial found through a Google search to at least get you started. 
 
 sqlite is the relational database management system most popularly used in mobile device as a database for local storage. Its used in embedded system.  
 SQL is also known as Structured Query language is the based on relational algebra. sqlite, MySQL, MSSQL and etcs are part of SQL. They use all sql syntax but each database (sqlite, MySQL, MSSQL) have their own query convention 
 MySQl is a large scale entriprise database also known as Relational database management system. These database are very scalable and can handle huge terabyes of data.  
 Other database are PostgreSQL and there are many other... 
 
 SQL stands for Structured Query Language; it is a language designed to access and manage data stored in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). 
You can add, retrieve, remove, or access data within a database with the help of SQL at any time using some basic queries.
In short, SQL not only allows users to access data stored in a Relational Database Management System but also creates, deletes databases and sets permissions on database tables, views and procedures.  
 SQLite is a software library that provides a Relational Database Management System.
The lite in SQLite means light weight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resource. 
SQLite has the following noticeable features: self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration and transactional.
SQLite is the lite form of SQL which runs on low powered devices or the devices with low memory such as mobile devices, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or pocket music players.
SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.
SQLite is file-based whereas SQL is a server based. 
 MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL).
It is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. 
The most common use for MySQL is for the purpose of a web database.
