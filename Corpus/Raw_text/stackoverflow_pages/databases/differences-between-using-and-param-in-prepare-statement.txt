*** differences-between-using-and-param-in-prepare-statement ***

 Let's say I want to select records where  . Prepared statements allow two ways of binding parameters: 
 
 question marks 
 
 
 
 named parameters 
 
 
 Both are working fine and give accurate results but I am not able to get the exact differences between these two nor when I should use one or another? 
 
 Question mark parameters are called  **positional**
 parameters. 
 Parameters defined with   and a name are called  **named**
 parameters. 
 The rule is that you can't mix the two in your prepared statement. 
 Positional parameters work in a simple way - if you have two positional parameters, you can specify an array with two elements. Array values will be bound in order as they appear in the array. 
 Named parameters are a bit trickier, they  don't have to be bound in order they appear . You can also repeat one named parameter multiple times in the statement, but you can bind it only once to pass the value - that last part works when PDO is set to emulation via  . 
 
 This seesm to be more of a preference based question as there isn't a strict right or wrong answer. 
 Personally I avoid   as it's tightly tied to the order of parameters. Although theoretically you shouldn't be able to mess this up by adding or removing binding a single binding, it just seems like it's asking for trouble. It is (slightly) less work though. 
  is more concise and is tightly bound to the identification of bindings, not arbitrarily to the order. It involves a (tiny) bit more work but it is much easier to debug, and less prone to mistakes. 
 I prefer being (slightly) concise over writing (slightly) less code. 
 
 **These are different placeholders**

 
 The difference between   is that with question mark placeholders  you'll have to take care about the order in which they will be bound to the query .
