*** disable-constraints-temporarily ***

 I have many tables with relationship constraints. Tables contain full of dummy data, i would like to truncate/empty the data from the tables while keeping the structure. 
 Everytime i want to empty a table, i get foreign key constraint errors. What can i do to disable the constraint temporarily and then set enable it back once dummy data are deleted.  
 I tried this solution, but didn't work! Once i disable, then try to truncate, i get fk constraint error... 
 
 I'm using MySQL. 
 Any idea? 
 
 You have to remove the FK if you want to use  , as truncate not a logged operation.   
 Can use   with FK in place but delete is a logged operation and takes longer. 
 
 Start at the end (tables that are only FK) and not referenced BY any other tales.  Those you can truncate.  Then work your way up and delete.  If you truncate / delete in the proper order then you will not violate the contraints.   Or you could drop all the constaints.  Truncate the tables.   Then add the contraints back in.
