*** disable-notices-in-psql-output ***

 How do I stop psql (PostgreSQL client) from outputting notices? e.g. 
 
 psql:schema/auth.sql:20: NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "users_pkey" for table "users" 
 
 In my opinion a program should be silent unless it has an error, or some other reason to output stuff. 
 
 
 That  could be set only for the session or made persistent with   or  . 
 Or you could put that in your  ".psqlrc" . 
 
 Probably the most comprehensive explanation is on Peter Eisentrauts  blog entry here 
 I would strongly encourage that the original blog be studied and digested but the final recommendation is something like : 
 
 
 Use   when you start psql. 
 A notice is not useless, but that's my point of view. 
 
 I tried the various solutions suggested (and permutations thereof) suggested in this thread, but I was unable to completely suppress PSQL output / notifications. 
 I am executing a   BASH script that does some preliminary processing then calls/executes a PSQL .sql script, to insert 1000's of entries into PostgreSQL.

 **SOLUTION**

 Note this modified PSQL line, where I redirect the psql output: 
 
 The   redirect appends all output to an output file, that can also serve as a log file. 
 **BASH terminal output**

 
 **Monitor progress:**

 In another terminal, execute 
 
 
 
  gets the script PID, assigned to $PID 
  : while that script is running, do ... 
  : use the output file line count as a progress indicator 
 when done, notify by playing   5 times

 It can be set in the global   file as well with modifiying the   parameter.
