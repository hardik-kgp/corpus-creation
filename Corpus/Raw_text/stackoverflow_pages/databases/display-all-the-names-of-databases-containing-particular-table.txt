*** display-all-the-names-of-databases-containing-particular-table ***

 I have many databases in my SQL Server. 
 I have to just search for database names containg particular table name  
 I have many databases such as  ,  , etc and I just want to find database names from query that contain this table  . 
 I searched I tried for query: 
 
 but it didn't work. 
 I searched further and came across: 
 
 but dont know how to arrange further where condition for search of table name 
 Please help me. 
 
 I got it done through following query: 
 
 
 
 try this one  
 
 I needed something slightly different.   
 This will return all tables and their corresponding DBs with names containing the supplied string: 
 
 
 If you need to find database objects (e.g. tables, columns, triggers) by name - have a look at the  **FREE**
 Red-Gate tool called  SQL Search  which does this - it searches your entire database for any kind of string(s). 
 
 
 It's a great must-have tool for any DBA or database developer - did I already mention it's absolutely  **FREE**
 to use for any kind of use?? 
 As for the   or the SQL Server specific catalog views: as far as I know, those are always constrained to the current database you're in - so you cannot search across all databases on your server. SQL Search does this for you - by searching into every single database on the server. 
 
 Create Procedure as bellow 
 
 
 It Works!!!!!!!  
Run this query for finding database name for a particular table
The paste table name in @tablename 
 Drop table #tempo for next time run  
 
 At the last giving error like  
 
 Database 'databasename' cannot be opened because it is offline. 
 
 then run this query separately
