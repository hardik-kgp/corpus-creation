*** display-special-characters-using-system-out-println ***

 I'm having trouble sending or displaying text with special characters from my webservice to my database. On my eclipse I have set the character encoding to UTF-8 but it still doesn't let me display the characters. For example a simple print like the code below 
 
 OR 
 
 The result on the console and if I send this to my database is ??????. How do I get this to display correctly on the console and hopefully in the database  
 
 Yeah, its the XXI. century and we're still struggling with things like character encoding... 
 My first guess is that either: 
 
 your source file encoding might be wrong (do you use build tools like Maven? It might be needed to set the source-encoding there too), 
 your console encoding might be wrong (are you under Windows? The default command line console is not UTF by default, its local-dependant, but with a small play in the registry you can set its encoding) 
 your DB encoding might be incorrect (what is the Table encoding, can you check that?) 
 
 
 If you are using Eclipse, then  
 
 right click on you project.  
 Go to Properties 
 Select UTF-8 in "Text
File Encoding " 
 
 
 
 See if this works. 
 
 For storing in DB, use following to explicitly encode the string in UTF-8 
 
 
 may be you need to decode your character string to ISO-8859 first and then encode it to UTF-8
