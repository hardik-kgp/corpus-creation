 I'm using AbstractBaseUser for my user models in various projects. Updating to Django 1.8 RC1 works smoothly and I can run the migrate management command. However, when trying to create a fresh database table layout from scratch, I get the following error: 
 
 All works perfectly with Django 1.7.x and I cannot find anything about this issue elsewhere. So, is it a big with the RC1 version or did something change that I'm not aware of in Django 1.8?

 I've faced almost the same issue with Django 1.8, solved it only by running   for the app with custom User model ( **+read below**
) 
 e.g.: 
 
 **AND FOR EVERY**
 app that contained  ,   etc references to it, e.g.:     
 
 then   worked with no errors 
 the same approach works for any app containing extensions to django.contrib models, e.g. FlatPages etc...
