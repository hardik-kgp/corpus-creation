*** django-contrib-gis-db-backends-postgis-vs-django-db-backends-postgresql-psycopg2 ***

 If a gis application has some tables which don't have gis related columns, does the performance   better when use multiple databases (django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2 and django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis) compared using django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis only? 
 Multiple Databases also introduce some performance overhead and complexity. Could anyone show me the best practice for this scenario? 
 
 The performance difference will be almost completely invisible.  django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis just extends django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2 to add the PostGiS types.  It is definitely not worth going through the complexity of multiple databases just to use the two different backends.
