 The problem Im facing while trying to connect to database for mysql. I have also given the database settings that i have used. 
 
 Databse Settings:: 
 
 Thanks a lot for the help !! 
 
 It looks like you don't have the python mysql package installed, try: 
 
 or if not using a virtual environment (on *nix hosts): 
 
 
 you have to install python-mysqldb - Python interface to MySQL 
 Try  
 
 
 If you get errors trying to install mysqlclient with pip, you may lack the mysql dev library. Install it by running: 
 
 and try again to install mysqlclient: 
 
 
 When I set up Django development environment for PyCharm in Mac OS X Mountain Lion with python, mysql, sequel pro application I got error same as owner of this thread.
However, my answer for them who is running python-mysqldb under Mac OS Mountain Lion x86_x64 (MySql and Python also should be same architecture) and already tried everything like pip and etc. In order fix this problem do following steps: 
 
 Download MySql for Python from  here 
 Untar downloaded file. In terminal window do following: tar xvfz downloade.tar. 
 cd /to untared directory 
 Run sudo python setup.py install 
 If you get error something like this: "Environment Error: /usr/local/bin/mysql_config not found" then try to add path ass follows: "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin". But id did not helped to me and I found another solution. In the end of command execution error output which looks like this: 
 File "/path_to_file/MySQL-python-1.2.4b4/setup_posix.py", line 25, in mysql_config
raise EnvironmentError("%s not found" % (mysql_config.path,)) 
 Open setup_posix.py with vim and go to line 25 (In your case it can be different unless if it is same version).  
 Line 25 should look like this after your editing unless your mysql have symbolic link like follows '/usr/local/mysql/bin/':  
 
 After this I got another error as following: 
 django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Error loading MySQLdb module: dlopen(/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/MySQL_python-1.2.4b4-py2.7-macosx-10.8-intel.egg/_mysql.so, 2): Library not loaded: libmysqlclient.18.dylib
Referenced from: /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/MySQL_python-1.2.4b4-py2.7-macosx-10.8-intel.egg/_mysql.so
Reason: image not found 
 Finally I did following in console: 
 sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib 
 
 Currently everything works fine. So I hope it will be helpful for somebody who uses Mac. :) 
 
 My answer is similar to @Ron-E, but I got a few more errors/corrections so I'm putting my steps below for Mac OSX on Mavericks and Python 2.7.6. 
 
 Install Python mysql package (if you get a success message, then ignore the below steps) 
 
 When I did the above, I got the error "EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found"
     
    To fix this, I did the below in terminal: 
 
 When I reran step 1, I get a new error "error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1"
 
    To fix this, I did the below in terminal: 
 
 I reran step 1 and got the success message 'Successfully installed mysql-python'! 
 
 
 You are missing the python   library. Use this command (for Debian/Ubuntu) to install it:
 
 
 Download and install Mysql-python from here for windows environment.   http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysql-python .  
 
 It is because it did not find sql connector. try: 
 
 
 On Ubuntu it is advised to use the distributions repository. 
 
 
 This happened with me as well and I believe this has become a common error not only for Django developers but also for Flask as well, so the way I solved this issue was using brew. 
 
 
 
 
 This way every single issue was solved and both frameworks work absolutely fine. 
 P.S.: For those who use macports (such as myself), this can be an issue as brew works in a different level, my advice is to use brew instead of macports 
 I hope I could be helpful. 
 
 For Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 or python 3 versions 
 
 
 If you are using pyhton version 3.4 or above. you have to install  
 
 in terminal. then install   on your virtual env or where you installed pip. 
 
 With the same error message as Will, it worked for me to install mysql first as the missing file will be added during the installation.
So after 
 
 ran without errors. 
 
 Just to add to other answers, if you're using Django, it is advisable that you install mysql-python BEFORE installing Django. 
 
 I wasted a lot of time on this. Turns out that the default database library is not supported for Python 3.  You have to use a different one . 
 
 if the error looks like this  
 
 then try : 
 
 
 Faced similar issue. I tried installing   using pip, but it failed due to gcc dependency errors. 
 The solution that worked for me 
 
 Please note that I already had anaconda installed, which didn't had gcc dependency. 
 
 I was having the same problem.The following solved my issue 
 Run  **pip install pymysql**
 in your shell 
 Then, edit the init.py file in your project origin directory(the same as settings.py)
and then 
 add: 
 **import pymysql**

 **pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()**

 this should solve the problem. 
 
 I've  **solved**
 this issue in this environment: 
 
 **./settings.py**

 
 If you use   , install driver executing:   
 
 **Note that **
**didn't work for me.**
  
 Note that if you use    , you should install driver executing: 
 
 Finally execute: 
 
 If it's all right, python creates all these tables id database:  
 
 
 try: 
 
 I recommend to use it in a virtual environment. 
 
 Maybe you can try the following mode of operation: 
 
 
 Seems like you don't have permission to the Python folder. Try
