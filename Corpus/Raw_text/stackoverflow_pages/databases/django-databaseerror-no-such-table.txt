*** django-databaseerror-no-such-table ***

 I defined two models: 
 
 After that I even checked the sql, just for fun:  
 
 There it even says  
 I ran   to install the new models to the database. I went to the admin-interface to define some objects to play with, but I got the following error:  
 
 I shutdown the dev-server, ran   again, started the server: Still same problem. Why can't it find, the table, even though it just told me it created id? 
 
 As a tip for the future, look into  South , a very useful utility for applying your model changes to the database without having to create a new database each time you've changed the model(s). 
 With it you can easily:   and South will write your model changes.
The  documentation  is pretty straightforward. 
 
 Actually the problem was that the table never got created. Since I am fairly new with django, I did not know that   does not update existing models, but only creates the ones that do not exist.   
 Because the model 'Server' existed before I added the other model, and it was already in the db, 'syncdb' did not actually create the new tables. 
 
 I meet the same problem today and fix it.
I think you miss some command in tutorial 1. 
just do follow: 
 
 then fix it and gain the table polls and you can see the table created.
you should read the   command. 
 
 for django 1.9, this is what i did and it solved the issue. 
 
 
 python manage.py makemigrations app_name 
 python manage.py migrate 
 
 
 
 
 use "manage.py help" to check the command 
 if you find migrate and makemigration, it means your python has updated 
 
 step 1: 
 
 result 1: 
 
 step 2: 
 
 result 2: 
 
 finally, runserver. Done
