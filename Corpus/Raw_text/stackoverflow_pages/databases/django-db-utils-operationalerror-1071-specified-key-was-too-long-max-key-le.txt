*** django-db-utils-operationalerror-1071-specified-key-was-too-long-max-key-le ***

 My model: 
 
 I am add "unique_together": 
 
 In-migration time getting the error: 
 
 My DB is: 
    mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.0.17-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2 
 I tried to increase the length of the index mysql: 
 
 But this is still not enough: 
 
 The problem index length. How to specify the length limit Django index? 
 
 solution is 
 
 
 The previous two answers did not help in my case, so I'm posting my solution to my case when your limit is   (i.e. 1071, 'Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes'). 
 First of all, make sure you are working on   encoding! 
 Then, navigate to your setting file  , find the line  . If it is 
 
 please change to 
 
 Then, the problem should be solved. 
 The reason is simply because   does not support key size greater than 1000 bytes. 
 
 Just upgrade and migrate database to  **MySQL-8.0.11**
 or ** MySQL-5.7.21** also make sure to use  utf8  and  utf8_general_ci 
 I had that problem, then I updated to 8.0.11 on my testing enviroment and 5.7.21 on the server. Now it migrates on both enviroments. 
 
 I think all 4 of these things are needed: 
 
 This should get past the limit of 767 bytes for one column, but won't get past the 3072 bytes limit for the entire index. 
 In order to have a compound  unique  index composed of strings, normalize some of the strings.  Replacing a long string with a 4-byte INT will shrink the index below the limit. 
 
 You can recreate "database" again:  
 
 or change config file. Open /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf and change: 
 
 
 Upgrade mysql to 5.7 and try migrate again. 
 
 
 I ended up adding  
 
 to my DB backed configuration in settings.py and that fixed the problem. 
 The MySQL server was configured to use InnoDB as a default engine, but due to some reason it still tried to create tables with the MyISAM. I am running MySQL 5.1 with Django 2.2.1 and Python 3.6.7
