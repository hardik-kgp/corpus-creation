*** django-filter-datetime-base-on-date-only ***

 I'm trying to filter the query set in the BaseDatatableView on a date that's entered in by the user in the following format: mm/dd/yyyy. So start_date is in that format and will get converted to a datetime with strptime, see below. 
 I'd like to compare it to exactly a date datetimefield in the db, but i'd like to match the month, day, year exactly, disregarding the time. This is what I have so that doesn't work. 
 
 Thanks 
 
 **Best Option**
 (Django 1.9+ . -  For datetime fields, casts the value as date . Allows chaining additional field lookups. Takes a date value.) 
 
 **Options for Django < 1.9**

 One option (break the date down in the filter): 
 
 Another option (set the min/max time for the date and use range):
