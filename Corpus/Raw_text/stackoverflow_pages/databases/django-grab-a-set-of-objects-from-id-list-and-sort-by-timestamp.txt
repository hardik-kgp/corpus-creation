*** django-grab-a-set-of-objects-from-id-list-and-sort-by-timestamp ***

 I have a list of IDs for objects that I need to grab, then I have to sort them by their timestamp. Here's how I was going to do it: 
 
 But there are two things that bother me: 
 
 Is there no way to grab a collection of entries by a list of their IDs - without having to loop? 
 Can I append arbitrary objects to the QuerySet just based on their IDs ? 
 
 Thanks, 
 
 This can be done using such a code: 
 
 the   can be positive or negative  , depending how you want it sorted.  
 
 Try the following: 
 
 This returns all   objects that have their   in the given list of  . This way, you also don't need to append additional models to the resulting QuerySet.
