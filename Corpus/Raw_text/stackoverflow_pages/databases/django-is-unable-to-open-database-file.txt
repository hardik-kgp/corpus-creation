*** django-is-unable-to-open-database-file ***

 after running "python manage.py syncdb" i gett an error saying "unable to open database file". 
 here is the important part from my settings.py: 
 
 and here are the permissions for "apps.db": 
 
 My django server is called from apache... i don't know if it has to do with the permissions but changing the owner of apps.db to "www-data" did not work either 
 [edit] 
 to ensure www-data can access all of this i did the following:  
 did the following: 
 
 but it still does not work :(

 Make sure Apache can also write to the parent directory of the
  database. SQLite needs to be able to write to this directory. 
 Make sure each folder of your database file's full path does not start
  with number, eg. /www/4myweb/db (observed on Windows 2000). 
 If DATABASE_NAME is set to something like
  '/Users/yourname/Sites/mydjangoproject/db/db', make sure you've
  created the 'db' directory first. 
 Make sure your /tmp directory is world-writable (an unlikely cause as
  other thing on your system will also not work). ls /tmp -ald should
  produce drwxrwxrwt .... 
 Make sure the path to the database specified in settings.py is a full
  path. 
 
 
 I solved the error by changing the DATABASE_NAME to an absolute path:  . 
 On a windows machine, backslash should be escaped like:  . 
 
 DATABASE_NAME is deprecated. You must use the currently supported format.
i.e. 
 
 And also see other settings which are deprecated from the django website.:)) 
 
 For my linux system, I had to give process owner write permission to both the  **db.sqlite3**
 and the  **directory**
 that contained it! You could just setfacl instead! example: ( https://serverfault.com/questions/484818/best-way-to-set-up-permissions-with-nginx-php-fpm-on-shared-hosting ). 
 (py2.7)[me@server django-project-container]$ ls -la djangoproject/ 
 
 
 Well, I answered it on this question.  http://goo.gl/KAuXz   
 I faced exactly same issue. Here is my setting which worked. 
 
 Other setting in case of sqlite3 will be same/default. 
 
 To change the permission of parent directory, you can use below set of commands: 
 check apache process for apache v2: 
 
 the user/group is www-data
