*** django-model-get-distinct-value-list ***

 I try to get a list of distinct foreign keys and I wrote this: 
 
 But I get just a list of UNDISTINCT foreign keys... What am I missing? 
 Thanks! 
 
 Thats for the hint! Both solutions wont work 100%... but I kind of combined them :) 
 Passing an argument to distinct doesnt work for MySQL-databases (afaik) 
 This one works and returns just one object: 
 
 But thanks anyway :) 
 
 Perhaps you might want to go with this: 
 
 
 
 distinct not work with out order by 
 
 Any fields used in an order_by() call are included in the SQL SELECT
  columns. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results when used in
  conjunction with distinct(). If you order by fields from a related
  model, those fields will be added to the selected columns and they may
  make otherwise duplicate rows appear to be distinct. Since the extra
  columns donâ€™t appear in the returned results (they are only there to
  support ordering), it sometimes looks like non-distinct results are
  being returned. 
 Similarly, if you use a values() query to restrict the columns
  selected, the columns used in any order_by() (or default model
  ordering) will still be involved and may affect uniqueness of the
  results. 
 The moral here is that if you are using distinct() be careful about
  ordering by related models. Similarly, when using distinct() and
  values() together, be careful when ordering by fields not in the
  values() call.

 If you already have them as a list, then convert it to a   to get the distinct values.
