*** django-mysqlclient-install ***

 I am trying to start learning Django, but I can't even pass through the installation. I have Python 3.4, Django, setuptools and Apache installed. Is database all that is left to setup?  
 Also, I wanted to try with MySQL and this is the link from djangoproject:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient 
 The problem is that I can't find any information on what .whl file should I download, how to open it and if that is all I have to do. I dont get why there isn't some integrated Django developement kit or something, but that is a question for some other forum :) 
 
 I'd recommend that you read up the basics of   ( http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/ ) and continue from there. 
 Basically following commands should get you running: 
 
 Make sure you have MySQL (server) installed on your system. If you're on Mac OS X,   ( http://brew.sh/ ) is quite handy. 
 
 You don't download the whl file yourself. You use pip to install it directly: 
 
 Note that you  don't  need this to try Django; nor do you need Apache. Python and Django is already an "integrated development environment" since Python includes sqlite3, and Django includes a development server. 
 
 You don't have to download any whl file  
 
 will work just fine .
In case you get any Microsoft Visual C++ error try 
 
 hope it helps . 
 
 
 Try running these commands on the terminal to install mysqlclient  
 
 easy to miss the 64-bit 
 You might got the wrong bit version of Python. Check that your bit version of python is correct. I by misstake downloaded the 32-bit version of Python and I got the same issue as you. I could do   with the 64-bit version without any issues. 
 (note that the windowsx86 on the image is 32-bit) 
 
 Here is my solution. Make sure your virtualenv is activated, then type the following:
