*** django-orm-filter-by-extra-attribute ***

 I want to filter some database objects by a concatenated string. 
 The normal SQL query would be: 
 
 In the model, I have created a manager called PersonObjects: 
 
 I also configured this in my model: 
 
 Now accessing fullName works for single objects: 
 
 But it does not work in a filter: 
 
 Is this a bug or a feature? How can I fix this? 
 Thanks. 
 
 It's not a bug.   only inspects model definitions, so it doesn't recognize   as a declared field (because it's not - it's an extra argument in a query).  
 You can add the   to   using  : 
 
 
 I solved this by implementing a custom Aggregate function.
In this case I needed to concatenate individual fields into a street address to be able to filter/search for matches.
The following aggregate function allows to specify a field and one or more others to perform a SQL CONCAT_WS. 
 Edit 3 Aug 2015: 
 A better implementation with details gleaned from  https://stackoverflow.com/a/19529861/3230522 . The previous implementation would fail if the queryset was used in a subquery. The table names are now correct, although I note that this just works for concatenation of columns from the same table. 
 
 
 The proposed solution worked great with postgresql and JSONB fields in the code below. Only records that have the 'partner' key under the 'key' jsonb field are returned:
