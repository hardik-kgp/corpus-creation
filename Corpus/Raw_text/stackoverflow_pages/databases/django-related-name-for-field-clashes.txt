*** django-related-name-for-field-clashes ***

 I am getting a field clash in my models:  
 
 what would be a sensible                     'related_field' to  use on visitor field? This model 
                     basically represents the visits that take place to a 
                     particular user's profile. 
 Also should I replace any of the ForeignKey's with a ManyToManyField? The logic is a bit confusing. 
 Edit:
This seems to fix it, but I am unsure if it's what I want. :) 
 
 
 If a  visit  is a strong concept in your application, then it might make sense to have it the way you defined:  visit consists of a 'user user' and a 'user visitor' . 
 If, however, a  visit  is just a way in which  users  relate among themselves, then perhaps you should have a   relation between  users . For that purpose you should probably use  ManyToManyField.symmetrical  in a  User Profile  (in which you extend the information that comes with  ). 
 In any case, regarding the related_name, you may either  disable the backwards relation  if you won't be accessing the  visits  from the  user , or use a sensible name such as   on   and   on  , which would allow seeing who visited a user by calling   and who the user visited by  . 
 
 When you have a  , it creates a property named with the model name plus   to the referenced model.  The problem here is that both foreign keys want to create a property on   named  .  The solution is to add related names that are different for each foreign key. 
 Usually, I use plurals for related names.  In cases like these, I add an "as" clause to the related name: 
 
 You don't want a   unless you can have zero or more visitors per  , or users per  .
