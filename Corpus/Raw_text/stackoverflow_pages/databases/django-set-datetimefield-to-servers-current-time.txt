*** django-set-datetimefield-to-servers-current-time ***

 How do I do the equivalent of this SQL in django? 
 
 Particularly I want to set the datetime field using server's builtin function to get the system time from the server that the database was running on and not the time on the client machine.  
 I know you can execute the raw sql directly but I'm looking for a more portable solution since databases have different functions for getting the current datetime.  
 Edit: few people mentioned auto_now param. This updates the datetime on every modification while I want to update datetime only on certain occasions.  
 
 As j0ker said, if you want automatic update of the timestamp, use the   option. E.g.  . 
 Or if you want to do it manually, isn't it a simple assignment with python  ? 
 
 
 The accepted answer is outdated. Here's the current and most simple way of doing so: 
 
 
 You can use database function  Now  starting Django 1.9: 
 
 
 Here is how I solved this issue. Hope it saves someone time: 
 
 And then just using the DBNow() as a value where updating and filtering is needed: 
 
 
 You can use something like this to create a custom value to represent the use of the current time on the database: 
 
 And then to be able to use DatabaseNow on a DateTimeField: 
 
 Which then in turn finally allows you do a nice and clean: 
 
 
 My tweaked code works with sqlite, mysql and postgresql and is a bit cleaner than the proposed solutions. 
 
 I activate it @ the end of my models.py file like this: 
 
 and use it like this: 
 
 
 I've created a Python Django plugin module which allows you to control the use of   on   objects, both in specific cases (see   below) as well as automatically for   and   columns.

 Example usage: 
 
 
 If you want the datetime from a foreign server (i.e., not the one hosting the Django application), you're going to have to peg it manually for a datatime to use. You could use a SQL command like   or something over SSH, like  . 
 
 Maybe you should take a look into the documentation: 
 Modelfields: DateField 
 The option 'auto_now' could be just what you are searching for. You can also use it with the DateTimeField. It updates the DateTime each time you're saving the model. So with that option set for your DateTimeField it should be sufficent to retrieve a data-record and save it again to set the time right.
