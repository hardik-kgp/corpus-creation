*** django-test-database-looks-empty-while-test-is-runnin ***

 I have a Django project that uses local PostgreSQL server.
I'm using a debugger to debug some weird bugs that I have. While the debugger is stopped on one of the tests, I tried to look at the test database. I see this new database (test_project1) and all the schemes are defined as they should be. But all tables are empty.  
 I know that the tables are not empty:
- I used fixture and some tests already ran and returned data. 
- A post test created new user returned 201 status code. 
 And yet, I see no data when I try to access the database with pgAdmin3 or psql. 
 Any idea what is going on here?
Is there some kind of sophisticated cash mechanism that Django uses? 
 
 Django's   is  wrapping every test in its own transaction . So your database is not being used any time you do a request through ORM.
