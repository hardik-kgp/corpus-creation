 I want to store some additional information in that, automatically created, ManyToMany join-table. How would I do that in Django?  
 In my case I have two tables: "Employees" and "Projects". What I want to store is how much each of the employees receives per hour of work in each of the projects, since those values are not the same. So, how would I do that? 
 What occurred to me was to, instead of the method "ManyToManyField", create explicitly a third class/table to store those new informations and to set its relationship with "Employees" and "Projects" using the "ForeignKey" method. I'm pretty sure it will work, but is this the best approach? 
 
 Here is example of what you want to achieve:
