*** do-i-need-to-create-separate-index-for-primary-key-of-relational-database-table ***

 If I create table with primary key is index automatically created for the table or does that need doing separately. 
 i.e if this is the table ddl 
 
 do I also need to do  
 
 or not 
 (I'm using Derby a database that comes with Java) 
 
 You don't need to. The primary key is already an index.
