 Do you know a free test data generator for mysql database? 
 Maybe native tools allow you to generate test data? 
 
 You could try  GenerateData.com . It lets you quickly generate large volumes of custom data (Name, Adress, Phone number, random number, random text...) in a variety of formats (csv, xml, excel, mysql, oracle). 
 **Edit:**
 If you don't want to install it, there is an  online generator  that allows you to generate data up to 5000 rows. 
 
 I've come across this one generator.
