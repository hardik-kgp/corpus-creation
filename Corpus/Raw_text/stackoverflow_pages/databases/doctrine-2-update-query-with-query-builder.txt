*** doctrine-2-update-query-with-query-builder ***

 Hi
I've got the following query but it doesn't seem to work. 
 
 This returns the following error message: 
 
 Fatal error: Uncaught exception
  'Doctrine\ORM\Query\QueryException'
  with message '[Semantical Error] line
  0, col 38 near 'testusername WHERE':
  Error: 'testusername' is not defined.'
  in ... 
 
 I would be glad of any help

 It's much safer to make all your values parameters instead: 
 
 
 Let's say there is an administrator dashboard where users are listed with their id printed as a data attribute so it can be retrieved at some point via JavaScript. 
 An update could be executed this way â€¦ 
 
 AJAX  action handling: 
 
 Working example using Doctrine 2.5  (on top of Symfony3) . 
 
 With a small change, it worked fine for me
