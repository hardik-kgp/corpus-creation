 Does "group by" clause automatically guarantee that the results will be ordered by that key? In other words, is it enough to write: 
 
 or does one have to write 
 
 I know e.g. in MySQL I don't have to, but I would like to know if I can rely on it accross the SQL implementations. Is it guaranteed? 
 
  does not order the data neccessarily. A DB is designed to grab the data as fast as possible and only sort if necessary.  
 So add the   if you need a guaranteed order. 
 
 
 An efficient implementation of group by would perform the group-ing by sorting the data internally. That's why some RDBMS return sorted output when group-ing. Yet, the SQL specs don't mandate that behavior, so unless explicitly documented by the RDBMS vendor I wouldn't bet on it to work (tomorrow). OTOH, if the RDBMS implicitly does a sort it might also be smart enough to then optimize (away) the redundant order by.  @jimmyb 
 
 An example using PostgreSQL proving that concept 
 Creating a table with 1M records, with random dates in a day range from today - 90 and indexing by date 
 
 Grouping by date truncated by day of month, restricting select by dates in a two days range 
 
 Using a larger restriction date range, it chooses to apply a  **SORT**

 
 Just by adding   at the end (there is no significant difference) 
 
 PostgreSQL 10.3 
 
 It definitely doesn't. I have experienced that, once one of my queries suddenly started to return not-ordered results, as the data in the table grows by.  
 
 I tried it. Adventureworks db of Msdn.

 It returns sorted data of hiredate, but you don't rely on GROUP BY to SORT under any circumstances. 
 for example; indexes can change this sorted data.  
 I added following index (hiredate, jobtitle) 
 
 Result will change with same select query;

 It depends on the number of records. When the records are less, Group by sorted automatically. When the records are more(more than 15) it required adding Order by clause
