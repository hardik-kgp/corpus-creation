*** does-leveldb-support-java ***

 I want to know if LevelDB supports java ?
Where can i get the LevelDB. There are no files under  http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/ 
 
 You can use the  https://github.com/fusesource/leveldbjni  java library which gives you a Java API to LevelDB via JNI. 
 There is also a Pure Java implementation of LevelDB available at  https://github.com/dain/leveldb 
 Both the JNI wrapped and pure Java implementation implement the same interface classes so it's really easy to switch between the two. 
 
 LevelDB currently does not ship with JNI bindings, but you can wrap your own JNI binding around the file db/c.h via SWIG and the like. 
 
 You can have a try of  leveldb-java . This is a pure Java version of LevelDB. 
 
 From looking at the source, i can say that it doesn't support java. 
 For the source use
