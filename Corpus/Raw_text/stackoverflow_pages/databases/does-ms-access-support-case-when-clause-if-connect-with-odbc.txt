 Does ODBC support   clause for MS Access? Is there any other database which does not support the   clause? I tried the following query while connecting to MS Access with ODBC but get an exception. 
 
 
 I'm try to find a common way which works for most of the database to generate (compute) the new 'boolean columns' with an comparison expression while connect with ODBC. Actually, MS Access support the comparison in SELECT clause, but for some other databases CASE clause are needed. For MS Access, the SQL can be  
 
 but in others it have to be  
 
 
 You could use   statement like in the next example: 
 
 
 Since you are using Access to compose the query, you have to stick to Access's version of SQL. 
 To choose between several different return values, use the switch() function. So to translate and extend your example a bit: 
 
 The 'true' case is the default one. If you don't have it and none of the other cases match, the function will return null. 
 The  Office website  has documentation on this but their example syntax is VBA and it's also wrong. I've given them feedback on this but you should be fine following the above example. 
 
 I have had to use a multiple IIF statement to create a similar result in ACCESS SQL.  
 
 All remaining will stay Null.
