 Does MySQL allows to create database which has dot ( ) in its name? 
 I'm using MySQL 5.1.22. 
 
 You can't use the dot in a database name. Also, I'd avoid using it in any identifier. A common convention is to use underscore instead. It will serve the same purpose and will avoid a LOT of confusion. If you  **do**
 have a good reason for using strange and otherwise-illegal characters in a table or field name, then you have to escape it. 
 to escape identifiers in MySQL, use the backtick: 
 
 Getting into the habit of backticking all field names regardless of whether you  need  to is a good practice in my opinion, but that's another story. 
 
 You can use   in names from MySQL 5.1.6  according to the documentation . 
 However, as has been said and will said again,  please  don't do it.  For every problem you think you're solving now you'll be creating five which will bite you later on.  Since . is used to qualify names - e.g.   or   you'll have to quote your database name every time you use it.* 
 You can do this with backticks: 
 
 or using double quotes if you set the following option: 
 
 * Not strictly true - you have to quote any character that's not alphanumeric or   or   , but . is a particularly troublesome option to have in your names. 
 
 Before MySQL 5.1.6, database and table names cannot contain  ,  ,  , or characters that are not allowed in file names (see  8.2. Schema Object Names ). 
In versions after 5.1.6 you have to quote your tablename with a backtick ( ) - but as others also advised: you shouldn't do this to prevent any unnecessary trouble. 
 
 MySQL 5.0.22 doesn't appear to allow it: 
 
 Even it if it did allow it, I would strongly recommend against it. 
 At the very least you'd have to escape any reference to that database with backticks in every single query that ever uses it.
