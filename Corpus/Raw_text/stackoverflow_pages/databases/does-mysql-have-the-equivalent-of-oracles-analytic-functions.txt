 I'm looking for analytical function like   in MySQL (see the  docs  for more info) 
 
 Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a group of
  rows. They differ from aggregate functions in that they return
  multiple rows for each group. 
 
 Does it exist? 
 
 No, it is one of the main lack of MySQL, compared to others DBMS like MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL. I strongly doubt to see Window Functions in MySQL in any future, especially after Oracle acquisition of MySQL ...

 MySQL 8.0 now supports  window functions . 
 
 just wanted to tell you that you can use variables in MySQL to mimic analytic functions. SUM OVER, for example, could be done as follows: 
 
 
 
 If you want to  , it's possible but just a bit more complicated. Basically, you add another   to watch the account (or whatever you want to partition by), order by account (or your variable), and then reset the   when the account changes. As follows: 
 
 
 
 You'll note two major changes that had to be done to accomplish the partition effect: 
 
 The main table ( ) is encased in a sub select with an   clause. This is necessary because when MySQL goes to do the   variable testing the values need to already be ordered. If this didn't happen, you'd get incorrect sum values as well as account values. 
 There is an 'extra' column aliased  . You can ignore this column when using results, but the order of the   check and change needs to be after the   check and change.  
 Also with this, you could choose to reorder your columns if you didn't mind account being last. This is done by taking out the first   column since it duplicates with the last   column and then obviously renamed the aliased   to  .

 Although MySQL doesn't support analytic functions,  MariaDB  does. It's a drop-in replacement for MySQL and is created by the original developers of MySQL. 
 
 There is a commercial product for SQL Server that provides in-database analytic functions and it can be connected to an oracle or MySQL database via 'linked servers'/odbc - here is an article describing it:

 This requires having a Windows o/s and SQL Server 2005 or later (which the Express version is free)
