*** does-mysql-ignore-null-values-on-unique-constraints ***

 I have an email column that I want to be unique. But I also want it to accept null values. Can my database have 2 null emails that way? 
 
 Yes, MySQL allows multiple NULLs in a column with a unique constraint. 
 
 Result: 
 
 **This is not true for all databases.**
 SQL Server 2005 and older, for example, only allows a single NULL value in a column that has a unique constraint. 
 
 From  the docs : 
 
 "a UNIQUE index permits multiple NULL
  values for columns that can contain
  NULL" 
 
 This applies to all engines but  BDB . 
 
 I am unsure if the author originally was just asking whether or not this allows duplicate values or if there was an implied question here asking, "How to allow duplicate   values while using  ?" Or "How to only allow one     value?" 
 The question has already been answered, yes you can have duplicate   values while using the   index. 
 Since I stumbled upon this answer while searching for "how to allow one     value." For anyone else who may stumble upon this question while doing the same, the rest of my answer is for you... 
 In MySQL you can not have one     value, however you can have one   empty value by inserting with the value of an empty string. 
 Warning: Numeric and types other than string may default to 0 or another default value. 
 
 Avoid nullable unique constraints. You can always put the column in a new table, make it non-null and unique and then populate that table only when you have a value for it. This ensures that any key dependency on the column can be correctly enforced and avoids any problems that could be caused by nulls.
