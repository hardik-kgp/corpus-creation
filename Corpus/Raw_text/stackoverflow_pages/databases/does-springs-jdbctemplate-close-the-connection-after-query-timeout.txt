 I have set query timeout (getJdbcTemplate().setQueryTimeout(5)) in method with insert statement. What will happen after query timeout, does jdbc template close my connection? 
 
 In short yes it does close the connection. The long answer it depends.  
 When you don't have a Spring managed transaction then yes the   will call the   method on the  . However if there was already a connection available due to Springs transaction management closing the connection will be handled by Springs transaction support, which in turn also will call   on the  .  
 The only difference is when the connection is closed but   will be called. 
 If the connection will be actually closed depends on which   is used, in general when using a connection pool the connection will be returned to the pool instead of actually closing the connection. 
 
 Yes it does. 
 And if the connection was obtained from connection pool, it won't actually close the connection, rather will send it back to the pool. 
 
 No need to close the connection manually. Spring container itself to take of the operation. Kindly refer this spring url,

 We can also close connection while using  , in some cases it is compulsory to close connection after executing a query otherwise you'll get connection issue. For more details visit  Close connection in jdbc template
