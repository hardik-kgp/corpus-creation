*** does-sqlite3-not-support-foreign-key-constraints ***

 I am have a problem with SQLITE3. 
 I have created 2 tables   and   using the following SQL script: 
 
 Even though the persons table is empty rows can be inserted into the   table. 
 It does not show any error. 
 How is this possible. 
 
 In SQLite 3.x, you have to make the following query  **every time**
 you connect to an SQLite database: 
 
 Otherwise SQLite will ignore all foreign key constraints. 
 Why every time? Backwards compatibility with SQLite 2.x, according to the the  documentation . 
 In SQLite 4.x, FK constraints will be  enabled by default . 
 
 SQLite Foreign Key Support  
 
 This will enable foreign key constraint. 
 
 Check out if you have foreign key constraints enabled in your SQLite:  http://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable 
 
 Did you read the documentation? The  main page  says it's introduced with version 3.6.19. The  link  shows how to use foreign keys (Your code is correct). 
 Does your code give any error messages you omitted? Did you check all preconditions in specified in the documentation?
