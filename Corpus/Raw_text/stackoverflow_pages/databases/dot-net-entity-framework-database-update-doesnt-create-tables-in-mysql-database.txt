*** dot-net-entity-framework-database-update-doesnt-create-tables-in-mysql-database ***

 I'm using   as database with the official connection provider. I'm trying it with the next project example (asp.net core 1.0) on a mac: 
 
 And in my Startup.cs 
 
 In my project.json I also add 
 
 and 
 
 When I run  , works fine and creates the migration files, but when I execute   the database is created but tables not and throws this output 
 
 
 Exceptions says it. The official MySQL Provider from Oracle doesn't support it migrations or scaffolding yet.  
 It will only create the Database on first execution of  . Any changes done after that, won't be applied. You have to drop the whole DB and create a new one, losing all data.  
 Say thanks to Oracle ;) 
 **Update**

 With the release of 7.0.6-IR31  package  migrations do work, but scaffolding still doesn't.  
 
 As Tseng said, this is a known issue. Here is the bug report from 14 Sept 2016. 
 
 Missing implementation for running EntityFramework Core code first migration
