*** drawable-to-byte ***

 I have an image from the web in an  . It is very small (a favicon) and I'd like to store it in my SQLite database.
I can get a   from   but then I don't know what to do next. I don't fully understand the   class in Android.

 But how do I get a byte array from a  ?

 If Drawable is an BitmapDrawable you can try this one. 
 
 **Bitmap.getRowBytes()**
 returns the number of bytes between rows in the bitmap's pixels. 
 For more refer this project:  LazyList 
 
 
 now the image is stored in the bytearray..
