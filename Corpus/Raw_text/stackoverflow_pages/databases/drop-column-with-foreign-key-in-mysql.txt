*** drop-column-with-foreign-key-in-mysql ***

 I have the following 2 tables: 
 
 I am trying to remove a column from a table with the following: 
 
 But cannot do it since I recieve this error: 
 
 I have tried to first remove the index and then remove the column with this: 
 
 But then I get the following error: 
 
 So I tried to drop the foreign key: 
 
 But received this error: 
 
 I have also tried to first set all the values to null: 
 
 But then received this error: 
 
 And now I am stuck. I have tried a few things but just cannot get the column removed. I am not allowed to alter the DB in any way other than removing the column.  
 
 Your   syntax is using the wrong key name. It's trying to drop your "plain" index on the   field. It's NOT the foreign key itself. 
 
 Try: 
 
 
 Use this given below query to find the name of the foreign key. 
 
 Then once u got the key, execute drop foreign key command 
 
 Then execute the drop column command  
 
 
 ALTER TABLE  .  
DROP FOREIGN KEY  ;
ALTER TABLE  .  
DROP INDEX   ;
