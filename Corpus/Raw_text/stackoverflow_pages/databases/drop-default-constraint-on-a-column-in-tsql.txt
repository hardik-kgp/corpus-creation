*** drop-default-constraint-on-a-column-in-tsql ***

 I am altering the column like this to make it nullable: 
 
 However, the default constraint, named 'DF__mytable__datab__7DE4B36' in one instance of the table, still remains. I know this could have been avoided if the original author named the constraint. I have several of instances of these tables but I don't want to manually delete every constraint in every table I have. What is the easiest and most elegant way of dropping this default constraint on a column in Sql Server that I can uniformily apply to every instance of this table? 
 **EDIT**

 I would like to refer a previous question, Because I have faced same problem and solved by this  solution .
First of all a constraint is always built with a   value in it's name. So problem is this   is varies in different Machine or Database. For example   here   is the hash value(8 bit). So I am referring a single script which will be fruitful to all  
 
 It will drop your default constraint. However if you want to create it again you can simply try this   
 
 Finally, just simply run a   command to drop the column.
