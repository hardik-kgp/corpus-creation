*** duplicate-an-ar-record-re-insert-this-into-the-database ***

 I have a AR model that I am trying to duplicated but just need to manually change the foreign key. 
 
 This query basically queries the prizes table and gets all the rows for a particular competition. With the prizes object I would like to basically re-insert/duplicate the same information except the competition id which I want to manually set. 
 I did something similar for an AR object that basically only has one row and that worked well, however in this instance as a competition can have more than one prize this same code won't. 
 
 This works great - how would I modify this on a 'collection' of prizes and have this duplicated into the database while setting my own 'competition_id' value. 
 Note - i'm to new to Yii, so please let me know if I have made any obvious errors/bad practice
