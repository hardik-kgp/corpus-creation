*** duplicate-entire-mysql-database ***

 Is it posible to duplicate an entire MySQL database on a linux server? 
 I know I can use export and import but the original database is >25MB so that's not ideal. 
 Is it possible using mysqldump or by directly duplicates the database files? 
 
 First create the duplicate database: 
 
 Make sure the user and permissions are all in place and: 
 
 
 To remote server 
 
 To local server 
 
 
 I sometimes do a mysqldump and pipe the output into another mysql command to import it into a different database. 
 
 
 Create a mysqldump file in the system which has the datas and use pipe to give this mysqldump file as an input to the new system. The new system can be connected using ssh command. 
 
 no space between -p[password] 
 
 Here's a windows bat file I wrote which combines Vincent and Pauls suggestions.  It prompts the user for source and destination names. 
 Just modify the variables at the top to set the proper paths to your executables / database ports. 
 
 **Sample output:**

 
 
 This won't work for InnoDB.
Use this workaround only if you are trying to copy MyISAM databases. 
 If locking the tables during backup, and, possibly, pausing MySQL during the database import is acceptable,  mysqlhotcopy  may work faster. 
 **E.g.**

 **Backup:**

 
 **Restore:**

 
 mysqlhotcopy  can also transfer files over SSH (scp), and, possibly, straight into the duplicate database directory. 
 **E.g.**

 This worked for me with command prompt, from OUTSIDE mysql shell: 
 
 This looks for me the best way. If zipping "dump.sql" you can symply store it as a compressed backup. Cool! For a 1GB database with Innodb tables, about a minute to create "dump.sql", and about three minutes to dump data into the new DB db2.  
 Straight copying the hole db directory (mysql/data/db1) didn't work for me, I guess because of the InnoDB tables.  
 
 Once upon a time in MySQL you could just copy all the table files to another directory in the mysql tree 
 mysql cli - create database db2 
 linux cli - cp db1 db2
