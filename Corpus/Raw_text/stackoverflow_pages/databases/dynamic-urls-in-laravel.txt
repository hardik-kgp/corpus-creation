*** dynamic-urls-in-laravel ***

 I am looking at  switching to laravel  for my next project. 
 My next project is probably going to be a small site with a few static pages, a blog and a projects manager and will be using controllers not routes. 
 What I am curious about is how I can manage dynamic routes in Laravel. 
 Basically, I want to build in an admin section so I can easily create the static pages on the fly, and the static pages will have SEO focussed urls, e.g.  http://domain.com/when-it-started  I do not want to have to create a new controller or route manually for each page. 
 So I am wondering what the cleanest way is to handle this. 
 essentially all static pages are going to share the same view, just a few variables to change. 
 The dynamic routing should work  with  the controllers not instead of. 
 E.g. if we have a controller   with a function   then this should be loaded via   http://domain.com/about/staff 
 but we dont have the function  , so a call to  http://domain.com/about/players  should check the database to see if a dynamic route exists and matches. If it does display that, otherwise show the 404 page. Likewise for a non-existant controller. (e.g. there would not be a   controller!) 
 The chosen answer doesn't seem to work in Laravel 4. Any help with that? 
 
 For Laravel 4 do this 
 
 
 You could use the route wildcards for the job, you can start with an   and if you need multiple url segments add an optional  , then identify the page from the slug. 
 For example: 
 
 
 Very similar to Charles' answer, but in the controller: 
 
 Then you can route it like this: 
 
 ...which has the added bonus of allowing you an easy way to link straight to the slug routes on an index page, for example:
