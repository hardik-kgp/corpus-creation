 What is the best method to copy the data from a table in one database to a table in another database when the databases are under different users? 
 I know that I can use 
 
 But here the problem is that both   and   are under different MySQL users. So   can access   only and   can access   only. Any idea? 
 
 If you have shell access you may use   to dump the content of   and pipe it to   to  . The problem here is that   is still  . 
 
 Maybe you need to rename   to   with another query. On the other way you might use sed to change table1 to table2 between the to pipes. 
 
 If table2 already exists, you might add the parameters to the first mysqldump which dont let create the table-creates. 
 
 
 
 where db1 is the destination and db2 is the source 
 
 If you are using  **PHPMyAdmin,**
 it could be really simple.
Suppose you have following databases: 
 
 DB1 have a table users which you like to copy to DB2 
 Under PHPMyAdmin, open DB1, then go to users table. 
 On this page, click on the  **"Operations"**
 tab on the top right.
Under Operations, look for section  **Copy table to (database.table):**

 & you are done!  
 
 **MySql Workbench**
: Strongly Recommended 
 
 This will easily handle migration problems. You can migrate selected tables of selected databases between MySql and SqlServer. You should give it a try definitely. 
 
 I use Navicat for MySQL...  
 It makes all database manipulation easy ! 
 You simply select both databases in Navicat and then use. 
 
 
 Use MySql Workbench's Export and Import functionality.
Steps: 
 1. Select the values you want   
 
 
 Click on the Export button and save it as CSV. 
 create a new table using similar columns as the first one   
 
 select all from the new table   
 
 Click on Import and select the CSV file you exported in step 2 
 
 
 
 I know this is old question, just answering so that anyone who lands here gets a better approach. 
 As of 5.6.10 you can do  
 
 Refer documentation here:  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-like.html 
 
 If your tables are on the same mysql server you can run the following 
 
 
 Here is another easy  way: 
 
 use DB1;   show create table TB1;  

 
 copy the syntax here in clipboard to create TB1 in DB2 
 
 use DB2;  

 
 paste the syntax here to create the table TB1 
 
 
 
 
 Try   ( documentation ) 
 Or you can create a " federated table " on your target host. Federated tables allow you to see a table from a different database server as if it was a local one. ( documentation ) 
 After creating the federated table, you can copy data with the usual  
 
 With MySQL Workbench you can use Data Export to dump just the table to a local SQL file (Data Only, Structure Only or Structure and Data) and then Data Import to load it into the other DB. 
 You can have multiple connections (different hosts, databases, users) open at the same time. 
 
 Is this something you need to do regularly, or just a one off? 
 You can do an export (eg using phpMyAdmin or similar) that will script out your table and its contents to a text file, then you could re-import that into the other Database. 
 
 use below steps to copy and insert some columns from one database table to another database table- 
 
 CREATE TABLE tablename ( columnname datatype (size), columnname datatype (size)); 
 
 2.INSERT INTO db2.tablename SELECT columnname1,columnname2 FROM db1.tablename; 
 
 IN xampp just export the required table as a .sql file and then import it to the required  
 
 One simple way to get all the queries you need is to use the data from information_schema and concat. 
 
 You'll then get a list of results that looks like this: 
 
 You can then just run those queries. 
 However it won't work with MySQL Views. You can avoid them by appending   from the initial query:
