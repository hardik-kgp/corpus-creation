*** easiest-way-to-diff-two-table-schemas-in-sql-server-2008 ***

 I have to do checks between a development and release database and do this manually, which is both slow and not 100% reliable (I only visually inspect the tables). 
 Is there a quick and easy way to compare table schemas automatically?  Maybe even a feature that does this built right into SQL server? 
 Edit: I'm comparing structure only, thank you for pointing this out. 
 
 I'm a fan of  SQL DBDiff , which is an open source tool you can use to compare tables, views, functions, users, etc. of two instances of SQL Server databases and generate a change script between the source and destination databases. 
 
 There are some commercial products that do this; Visual Studio 2010 Premium Edition can compare schemas. 
 Some others:

 Data or structure or both?  Try RedGate sql compare or data compare.  They both have free trials and are awesome.

 I'm a little late to the game...but this script I made has worked well for me. It'll work across linked servers too if needed. 
 
 
 Soo, 
 Googled this: 
 for structures :

 My previous answers' links doesn't work anymore for some reason, so here's another answer from  TechNet : 
 
 
 For a free solution, you can use  SQL Server Managements Objects  to output the DDL script for each table, view, index, SP, UDF, etc. Then you can compare, either in code, or using a diff tool like  WinMerge . 
 
 you can take a look at  http://cdttools.com/2011/10/sql-diff-erence/  its a low cost alternative, will walk schema between two databases and tell you whats changed. You can then use SQL Mgmt studio to generate "script->As Alter" to build change scripts. (caveat: I wrote it) 
 
 Modified a bit of  BD.'s query , all credit goes to him. (Changed   to sys.schemas join because   works with current db context which is  , changed sorting and changed column names and added the status column) 
 
 
 If two tables in same database, you can use this query 
 
 
 You can use the SQL Management studio tools to "Generate scripts" from both databases. Then use your favorite text comparison tool to see any differences.  
 In the old days, this worked great, but in SQL 2005 the generate script code changed and the objects were no longer created in the same order, so the text comparison is less useful. I have not tested this in more recent versions of SQL so it may have been fixed. You can also try  http://exportsqlscript.codeplex.com/  which I have used with good success to output the DDL as scripts for source code control and comparing versions.
