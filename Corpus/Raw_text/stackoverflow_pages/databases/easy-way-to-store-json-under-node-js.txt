*** easy-way-to-store-json-under-node-js ***

 I'm looking for a super-simple way to store one  **JSON**
 array in a persistent way under  **Node.js**
. It doesn't need to have any special features. I just want to put a JSON object in there and be able to read it at the next server restart. 
 (Solutions like  **MongoDB**
 and  **CouchDB**
 both seem like overkill for this purpose.) 
 
 Why not write to a file? 
 
 
 Try NeDB:  https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb 
 "Embedded persistent database for Node.js, written in Javascript, with no dependency (except npm modules of course). You can think of it as a SQLite for Node.js projects, which can be used with a simple require statement. The API is a subset of MongoDB's. You can use it as a persistent or an in-memory only datastore." 
 
 I found a library named  json-fs-store  to serialize JavaScript object to JSON in a file and retrieve it later.  
 When retrieving a file via the   method (not described in the docs at the moment), it is parsed with   which is better than doing a   like in the other answer: 
 
 you get proper error handling when the contents are malformed  
 if someone has managed to sneak JavaScript code into the file, it will lead to a parse error instead of the JS being executed. 
 
 
 If you are looking for performance consider: LokiJS 
 https://www.npmjs.com/package/lokijs 
 http://lokijs.org/#/ 
 
 If you need simple data storage, with no external processes, very high and stable performance, you might like  **Rocket-store**
  
 It's very simple to use; Include the module and the you can start inserting records right away.  
 It has three major methods:  **put**
,  **get**
, and  **delete**
 (and some special methods and options settings) 
 **Example:**
  
 
 **Rocket-store**
 relies on the underlying filesystem cache, to optimize for speed, and can operate with millions of records. 
 Its easily 100 times faster than a relational database, on inserts. Typically 70.000 inserts/sec. (PC)    
 You get simple sequences, auto increment and other minor conveniences, but that about it. Nothing fancy.  
 I like it a lot, when ever I need a simple storage solutions, but I'm also very biased, as the author ;) 
 
 You could just save the JSON-data in a simple textfile and read it at server restart. 
 
 and then work with it as usual.  
 
 Although both LokiJS and NeDB look to have more users, I just came across  TaffyDB .  Although I have not tried it myself I thought I should add it here for completeness.  
 
 Try  LowDB 
 Lowdb is a small local JSON database powered by Lodash (supports Node, Electron and the browser). If you know Lodash, you already know how to use Lowdb.
