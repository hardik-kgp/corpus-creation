*** ef-5-code-migration-errors-there-is-already-an-object-named-in-the-datab ***

 Doing EF5 Code Migrations and have been having an odd recurring issue that is now keeping me from working.  Tried to run   and received this error: 
 
 There is already an object named 'RequestStatus' in the database. 
 
 The verbose log dump: 
 
 I've tried everything under the sun that I've found on Google.
Things that I've tried and have not provided any results: 
 
 Trying to spin up a new database. 
 Deleting __MigrationHistory 
 This ,  this , and  this . 
 
 The most infuriating part is that my coworker is in the same codebase and is not experiencing this issue at all.  I'm using VS2012 and EF5's LocalDb. 
 **Some Code For Reference**

 **Database Initializer**

 
 **DB Context**

 
 **The RequestStatus that it is failing on.**

 
 **Which is a part of the Request Model**

 
 **Seed Method / Configuration.cs**

 
 
 Make sure the name of the connection string is the same as the DbContext you are trying to update. In other words you are trying to modify an existing database.
