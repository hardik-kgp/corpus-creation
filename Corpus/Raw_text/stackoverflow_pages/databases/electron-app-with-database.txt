*** electron-app-with-database ***

 I'm creating a web app for ticket reservation. The only problem is the database. I don't want to tell my client to install XAMPP or set a database, etc.  
 Is there any way to package the app with the database?  
 
 SQLite  is a good option for a local database that you can ship with your application. It won't require the user to setup or install any extra dependencies. It's certainly not as full featured as a full on server, but it should be good enough for a local desktop app. 
 
 There are many standalone databases you can use with JavaScript and Electron applications. Here are some that I can recommend 
 https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb  (last release 4 years ago) 
 https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb  (many features, observable queries) 
 https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb  (many open issues) 
 https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS  (only in-memory storage) 
 https://github.com/typicode/lowdb  (good for simple, small datasets) 
 
 It might helpful , if you have web hosting, and you able to write some  Ajax and backend system with PHP+ MYSQL.
You can write ajax in simple JavaScript or jQuery.
