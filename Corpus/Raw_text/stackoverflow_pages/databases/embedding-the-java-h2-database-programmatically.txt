*** embedding-the-java-h2-database-programmatically ***

 At the moment we use  HSQLDB  as an embedded database, but we search for a database with less memory footprint as the data volume grows. 
 Derby / JavaDB  is not an option at the moment because it stores properties globally in the system properties. So we thought of  h2 . 
 While we used HSQLDB we created a Server-object, set the parameters and started it. This is described  here  (and given as example in the class org.hsqldb.test.TestBase). 
 The question is: Can this be done analogous with the h2 database, too? Do you have any code samples for that? Scanning the h2-page, I did not find an example. 
 
 From the download, I see that the file tutorial.html has this  
 
 
 Yes, you can run H2 in embedded mode.  You just use the JDBC driver and connect to an embedded url like this (their example): 
 
 This database can be used in embedded
  mode, or in server mode. To use it in
  embedded mode, you need to: 
 
 
 Example of connecting with JDBC to an embedded H2 database (adapted from  http://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/jdbcx/JdbcDataSource.html  ): 
 
 If you're looking to use H2 in a purely in-memory / embedded mode, you can do that too.  See this link for more: 
 
 http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#in_memory_databases 
 
 You just need to use a special URL in normal JDBC code like "jdbc:h2:mem:db1". 
 
 If for some reason you need an embedded H2 database in server mode you can do it either manually using the API
at  http://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/tools/Server.html  - or by
appending ;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE to the database URL.
