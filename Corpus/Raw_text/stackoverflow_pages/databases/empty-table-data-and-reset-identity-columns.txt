*** empty-table-data-and-reset-identity-columns ***

 I created a database in SQL Server with a couple of tables. I ran some tests and now am ready to deploy my solution, problem is, there is all sorts of data in the tables. I want to delete every row of all the tables created with my tests and put back the primary keys to zero. I tried delete which doesn't reset the primary keys index, and drop simply destroyed the table. 
 
 You can try   which deletes all rows and resets identity seeds. However you will have to execute in a certain order if you have foreign keys. In which case you will need to delete from the child tables first, or drop the constraints and re-add them. 
 Also note that if you are using   you really shouldn't expect the numbers to mean anything, or to be generated forever without gaps. You shouldn't care whether it starts at 1 vs. 22 or 65 - can you explain why the identity values need to be reset?

 To set the value of the next ID to be 1, I can use this command:
