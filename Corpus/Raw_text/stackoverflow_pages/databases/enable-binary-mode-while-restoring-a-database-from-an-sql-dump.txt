 I am  extremely new to MySQL and am running it on Windows. I am trying to restore a Database from a dumpfile in MySQL, but I get the following error: 
 
 I have tried putting   in the ini file but it still gives the same error. What should I do? Please help.  
 **UPDATE**

 As suggested by Nick in his comment I tried   but it gave me the following   
It is a 500 Mb dump file, and when I view its contents using gVIM, all I can see is expressions and data which is not comprehensible.  
 
 Unzip the file, and then import again. 
 
 I meet the same problem in windows restoring a dump file. My dump file was created with windows powershell and mysqldump like: 
 
 The problem comes from the default encoding of powershell is UTF16. To look deeper into this, we can use "file" utility of GNU, and there exists a windows version  here .  
The output of my dump file is: 
 Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators. 
 Then a conversion of coding system is needed, and there are various software can do this. For example in emacs,  
 
 then input required coding system such as utf-8. 
 And in the future, for a better mysqldump result, use: 
   
 and then the output is handled by   itself but not redirection of powershell.

 In Windows machine, please follows the preceding steps. 
 
 Open file in notepad. 
 Click on Save as 
 Select Encoding type UTF-8. 
 
 Now source your db. 
 
 Have you tried opening in notepad++ (or another editor) and converting/saving us to UTF-8? 
 See:  notepad++ converting ansi encoded file to utf-8 
 Another option may be to use textwrangle to open and save the file as UTF-8:  http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ 
 
 Extract your file with Tar archiving tool. you can use it in this way:   
 
 
 May be your dump.sql is having garbage character in beginning of your file or
there is a blank line in beginning. 
 
 I had this error once, after running   on Windows PowerShell like so: 
 
 What I did was change it to this (pipe instead to Set-Content): 
 
 And the problem went away! 
 
 If you don't have enough space or don't want to waste time in decompressing it, Try this command. 
 
 Don't forget to replace compressed-sqlfile.gz with your compressed file name. 
 .gz restore will not work without command I provided above. 
 
 Its must you file dump.sql problem.Use Sequel Pro check your file ecoding.It should be garbage characters in your dump.sql. 
 
 I had the same problem, but found out that the dump file was actually a MSSQL Server backup, not MySQL. 
 Sometimes legacy backup files play tricks on us. Check your dump file. 
 On terminal window: 
 
 The result was: 
 
 To stop processing the cat command: 
 
 
 The file you are trying to import is a zip file. Unzip the file and then try to import again. 
 
 Your File should be only .sql extension, (.zip, .gz .rar) etc will not support.
example: dump.sql 
 
 You can use this to fix error:
