*** entity-framework-4-update-database-schema-from-model-without-wiping-the-table ***

 I'm working on a new project where I have the luxury of working from a Model to Database approach using Entity Framework 4.  
 The project I'm working on is taking an agile approach where different phases will be rolled out over time.  
 Will the Model First approach work in my case? I noticed when you "Generate Database from Model" it recreates the entire schema from scratch which will obviously wipe all the data that is in the db.  
 I was hoping for a more "Update Database from Model" approach where the db would just be altered to reflect the changes rather than recreated. 
 Does anyone have any experience working in this type of workflow with EF? 
 Thanks, 
 James Sheldon
