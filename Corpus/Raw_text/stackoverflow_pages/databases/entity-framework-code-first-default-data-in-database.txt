*** entity-framework-code-first-default-data-in-database ***

 How do I handle situations in which I need pre-existing data before the app is started or right after the database is generated. For example, I have a list of countries in which I'd like to load into the database after code-first generates it. How do I do this? 
 App is structured as follows: 
 
 The xml is in the   project. 
 
 You create custom initializer, which inherits from   or   interface. Like: 
 
 And then you overwrite Seed method like: 
 
 Whole example might look like: 
 
 Edit: After setting this up, you have to set up Initializer too, as Ladislav Mrnka mentioned. 
 
 ie.: in Global.asax:   
 
 Don't forget to add  
..... 
 
 You must create custom database initializer derived for example from   and fill data in overriden   method. Then you must use   to set your new initializer when application starts.  Here  is example (from CTP5) used to create custom index in the database. 
 
 For an example see the new MVC / Entity Framework tutorial series at
 http://www.asp.net/entity-framework/tutorials#Using%20MVC 
Both #1 and #4 show initializer classes.
