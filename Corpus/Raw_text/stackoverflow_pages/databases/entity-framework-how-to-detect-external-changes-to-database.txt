*** entity-framework-how-to-detect-external-changes-to-database ***

 I have a stored procedure that changes lots of data in the database. This stored procedure is called from the application that at the same time uses EF for data operations. 
 So I click a button, stored procedure is run at the database, data is changed and EF shows old data to the user. 
 Is there a way to force the DbContext or ObjectContext to refresh data from database? ObjectContext.Refresh() may be the solution but I do not want to call this method for every single table that may be changed. I want all the tables to be refreshed in one move. 
 I am using Entity Framework 5, targeting .NET 4.0 
 **EDIT: Added data is available but modification on existing data is not reflected by EF. I see the newly added records but I cannot see the changes I made to existing records.**

 
 Your   should be short-lived. Create it, run your query, and dispose it. 
 
 Don't keep your context around. That way you won't have any issues with old data.
