*** entity-framework-seed-method-is-not-being-called ***

 We are using Entity Framework 4.4 and using migrations. The database already exists and we need to update it on regular basis. The seed method, however, is not being called and so lookup values are not being added. 
 The code looks as follow: 
 
 And we are calling: 
 
 But the migration comes up empty. 
 Does anyone has an idea why the Seed is cmot being called and why the additional values in the lookup table are not being detected? 
 Thanks

 The Migrations Seed method  
 
 runs whenever the Update-Database PowerShell command is
  executed 
 
 You need to call   not  
  scaffolds a migration file containing commands to migrate the database to a new version. It is empty because there are no schema changes to make. You do not need to call   before calling   if all you want to do is seed
