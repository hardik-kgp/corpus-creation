*** equivalents-to-sql-server-top ***

 In SQL Server, TOP may be used to return the first n number of rows in a query. For example,  SELECT TOP 100 * FROM users ORDER BY id  might be used to return the first 100 people that registered for a site. (This is not necessarily the best way, I am just using it as an example).

 My question is - What is the equivalent to TOP in other databases, such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc? If there is not an equivalent keyword, what workarounds can you recommend to achieve the same result? 
 
 To select first   rows: 
  and  : 
 
 : 
 
 Note that you need a subquery here. If you don't add a subquery,   will select first   rows in random order and then sort them by  . 
 To select rows between   and  : 
 : 
 
 : 
 
 : 
 
 Note that an attempt to simplify it with   (as opposed to   in the outer query) will return nothing in  ! 
  will work in   too but is less efficient. 
 See the article in my blog for performance details: 
 
 **Oracle: ROW_NUMBER vs ROWNUM**

 
 
 For Postgres and MySQL it's the LIMIT keyword. 
 
 
 This is standard SQL (Oracle and SQL Server implement it). This is an example of returning up to 100 rows: 
 
 
 In SQL Anywhere, it's the same as SQL Server: 
 
 You can even start in the middle of the result set if you want: 
 
 gets the 50th through 150th rows of the result set. 
 
 
 as in 
 
 
 You can use RANK() and DENSE_RANK() in Oracle.  Here  is a link to AskTom website explaining how to to pagination and top-n queries with DENSE_RANK in Oracle. 
 
 Oracle: 
 
 With a nice explanation on how to make it work in  AskTom . 
 In Ingres the same query would by: 
 
 Ingres question was already answered in  StackOverflow  before. 
 
 In DB2 you would make your query look like this: 
 SELECT * FROM tblData  **FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY**
; 
 
 In Oracle you want to use a TOP-N query. 
 For example: 
 
 This will get you the top three results (because I order by desc in the sub query)
