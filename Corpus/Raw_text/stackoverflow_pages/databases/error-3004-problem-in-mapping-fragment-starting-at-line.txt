*** error-3004-problem-in-mapping-fragment-starting-at-line ***

 I have this error when I build my Web Service: 
 
 Error 3004: Problem in mapping
  fragment starting at line 323: No
  mapping specified for properties
  JE_TRN_HS.JE_HDR_HSJE_HDR_KEY. Entity
  is type [TESTCPModel.JE_TRN_HS 
 
 This is what happend. 
I created this Entity Data Model from an existing database.
I added 2 tables and rebuilt the Web Service. The build was successfull. 
 THEN I added an Association between the two tables. 
When I tried to rebuild it failed with the error message displayed above! 
 Now here's the kicker! I deleted the newly added Association and rebuilt. The build failed with the same error message!? 
The only way I can get rid of this error is if I delete the second table, rebuild and re-add the second table?? 
 I've looked EVERYWHERE for the solution to this problem!
Thanks

 In my case am not allowed to modify existing tables but I discovered that when you add a new table with "Include foreign key columns in the model" checked  in EF4 and the table doesn't contain any foreign key relationships then you try to add a association it will trigger this error. 
 Defining Constraints in an EF4 model that donâ€™t exist in the database 
 
 In case the linked article disappears, The solution is: 
 You need to open the properties window of the association and then click on the Referential Constraint ellipses to get to the ref constraint dialog.  Then select the correct field for the 'Dependent Property' setting. 
 
 In my case, another developer had deleted the field from the table in the database. Having realised this, removing the table from the entity model and adding it back solved the problem. 
 
 You cannot simply add tables from the database into your model and then create a new association in the model. By default it uses independent association which must be mapped to its database counterpart = the relation must exists in the database as well. You must  model your relation as FK association  but it allows only one-to-one and one-to-many associations. Differences between association types are  described here . 
 
 I hit this problem right now... Needed to add a scalar property, let's say   to an existing table using the Designer in Visual Studio. 
 I could've updated the Model from the Database but that was not an option. It was causing a lot of errors in the Model. It's a huge database model and the table I needed to add this property has maybe more than 30 relationships. I just wanted to map this new   column that got added to the table named  . 
 After adding the scalar property directly in the designer, the following exception was being thrown: 
 
 
 InnerException {"\r\nModels.MyDB.msl(352,10) : error 3004: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 352: No mapping
  specified for properties custom_table.custom_property in Set
  custom_table.\r\nAn Entity with Key (PK) will not round-trip when:\r\n 
  Entity is type [MyDB.custom_table]\r\n"}  System.Exception
  {System.Data.Entity.Core.MappingException} 
 
 
 In the   in VS this was being shown:  
 Steps I took to fix this: 
 
 Edited the   file in Visual Studio Code; 
 Looked for  ; 
 Complemented the   XML code with mappings. 
 
 These were the places where I had to add mappings: 
 
 and 
 
 
 I've had this problem when i ended up 'updating model from database' after having changed the connection string.  
 By right clicking the entity and toggling a key on and off It seems to have caused a refresh and has fixed the problem.  This seems more like a bug with the Entity framework. 
 It should be noted in this case i was using the MySQL connector so I suspect it's just rather finicky in general. 
 
 You can get this error if you have a property on the model that isn't mappable. 
 For instance I was converting some   over to   and had an error on a   field. Binary is a   type but for EF it needs to be  . Changing it fixed the problem. 
 
 Experienced a similar problem with EF 6: 
 
 The problem turned out to be that I had made a change to the *.edmx file for my database-first EF application directly in a text editor instead of using the designer.  So just reverted the text changes and applied them using the designer and the error went away.  Hitting save in the designer is what updated the associated *.msl file. 
 
 I was getting this error from Linqpad and could not figure out why it started happening all of a sudden and whether this would be an issue in my application using the context.  I also just deleted the class that was recently created by a new entity and then I right clicked on the .tt file and hit "run to cursor" to regenerate the class.  That fixed it for me. 
 
 Updating Model from Database option doesn't work for me.  
 So I need to delete all entities first before updating model from database to successfully fix  the solution. 
 
 If you have applied a mapping on the entity, try to remove that column from the table which will resolve the issue 
 
 In my case, my database administrator has  **changed column names**
 from  **uppercase to lower**
.
I solved the problem  **by updating (update model from database) for that table again**
. Then,  **deleted previous uppercase columns**
. 
 
 In my case, I had renamed a field in a table and added a primary key. After that, I got that error. I went to my list of objects/models and after delete it and refresh from the database, I had again the same error. I tried several times but nothing. The class that EF was generating was a mix between the old table structure and the new one.  
 After investigating for a while, this is the solution:
Go to the Diagram of your your entities. Locate your table or open on your right the Model Explorer (right click over the diagram - Open model explorer). Search for your model/table under ...Model, ...Model.Store and delete it. After that, add again the table from the database and problem solved.
