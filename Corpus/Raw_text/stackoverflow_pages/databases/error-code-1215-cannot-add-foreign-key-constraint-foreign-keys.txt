*** error-code-1215-cannot-add-foreign-key-constraint-foreign-keys ***

 
 I am trying to ensure data consistency between the tables by using foreign key so that the DBMS can check for errors; however, it seems we can't do that for some reason. What's the error and is there an alternative? Also, when I fill a table that has a foreign key, I can't fill the field that's reserved for the foreign key(s), right? Also, is a foreign key considered to be a key at all?  
 
 The most likely issue is this line: 
 
 The datatype of classLeader is VARCHAR(255). That has to  **match the datatype**
 of the referenced column...  . And of course, the   table has to exist, and the   column has to exist, and the   column should be the PRIMARY KEY of the student table (although I believe MySQL allows this to be a UNIQUE KEY, rather than a PRIMARY KEY, or even just have an index on it.) 
 In any case, what's missing here is the output from  
 
 There's a datatype mismatch. 
 The   column cannot be a foreign key reference to  . 
 The datatypes of the two columns has to match. 
 
 You are getting this error because of in  
datatype of   and   is different.Datatype of primary key column and foreign key column must be same. 
 From MySQL Site :  
 
 Corresponding columns in the foreign key and the referenced key must have similar data types. 
  The size and sign of integer types must be the same. 
  The length of string types need not be the same. 
  For nonbinary (character) string columns, the character set and collation must > be the same. 
 
 
 Though it is a late answer, I hope it would help few people. 
 I faced the same issue. But, here the Data types were also same.  
 But, When I checked the create table statement, I found that One table created using a engine called "MyISAM" and another one was using "InnoDB". 
 
 Then I changed both tables engine to "InnoDB" and it worked(I was able create Foreign Key) 
 
 The error gets resolved: 
 To create a Foreign key for a table like this 
 
 The below code works fine 
 
 
 Make sure you have a header and footer in sql dump otherwise you will see all sort of errors when restoring database 
 Header should look something like below -: 
 
 and footer should look something like below -: 
 
 Hope the above helps

 **Make sure if yourtable is using InnoDB engine**

 First, verify if engine is INNODB or not: 
 
 If not change the engine to InnoDB:  
 
 
 Set end reference point of the key to 'Unique' 
 
 Remove the   from Query , then checkout . It works for me.
