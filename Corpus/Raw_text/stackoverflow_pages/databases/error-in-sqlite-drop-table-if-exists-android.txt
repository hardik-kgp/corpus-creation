 here is the error: 
 
 i highlighted the problem but i cant solve it :/ 
 
 The problem seems to be with this statement: 
 
 where  , if it is really the name of the table to drop, is not delimited (with  , for instance) and thus cannot be treated as a name. But the parser expects a name there. Just enclose the name in single or double quotes, and it should work: 
 
 
 if the table name were all alpha characters, your original code would have worked.  Since the table name isn't all alpha, it needs to be surrounded with single quotes.

 db = This is your database handler class 
 
 
 Hi Think u should use call the statement : 
"context.deleteDatabase(DATABASE_NAME);" 
 before the call of "onCreate();" 
 
 
 You should change your: 
 
 with: 
 
 Also, you need to check if newVersion > oldVersion
