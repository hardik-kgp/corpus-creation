*** error-mysqlnd-cannot-connect-to-mysql-4-1-using-the-old-insecure-authenticatio ***

 I am getting the following error: 
 
 Database connection failed: mysqlnd cannot connect to MySQL 4.1+ using the old insecure authentication. Please use an administration tool to reset your password with the command  . 
 This will store a new, and more secure, hash value in  . If this 
      user is used in other scripts executed by PHP 5.2 or earlier you might 
      need to remove the old-passwords flag from your   file 
 
 I using PHP 5.3.8 and MySQL 5.5.16 on my local machine and my host (media temple) is running PHP 5.3 MySQL 5.0.51a.  The version on the live server is older than the one on my machine. 
 How do I fix this error and connect to MySQL from my local machine? 
 I know there are similar posts to this one but I have tried them all and none are working.  
 
 
 Remove or comment old_passwords = 1 in my.cnf 
 
 Restart MySQL. If you donâ€™t, MySQL will keep using the old password format, which will mean that you cannot upgrade the passwords using the builtin PASSWORD() hashing function.  
 The old password hashes are 16 characters, the new ones are 41 characters. 
 
 Connect to the database, and run the following query: 
 
 
 This will show you which passwords are in the old format, e.g.: 
 
+----------+--------------------+
| user     | Length(`Password`) |
+----------+--------------------+
| root     |                 41 |
| root     |                 16 |
| user2    |                 16 |
| user2    |                 16 |
+----------+--------------------+ 
 Notice here that each user can have multiple rows (one for each different host specification). 
 To update the password for each user, run the following: 
 
 Finally, flush privileges:

 I had a issue where the old passwords had been enable by the server by default, so a simple SET PASSWORD FOR 'some-user'@'%' = PASSWORD ('XXXX'); wouldn't work(for reason due to old software and legacy which I won't go into....) 
 Solution : 
 
 Details : 
 Doing this as the logged in user 
 
 Simply didn't work 
 Eg testable here 
 
 The password wouldn't shift to from 
 
 OLD PASSWORD 
 
 WHAT I WANTED, EG NEW PASSWORD 
 
 So I looked up the variables for old passwords 
 
 So basically I had to set the mysql server var first to old_password=OFF, eg this worked for me 
 
 
 I had the same issue trying to connect to mediatemple external-db through IIS on my local Windows machine. Updating my password for the specific db user solved the problem connecting to the database. 
 Within (mt) Account center, simply update the password. I used the same password and it solved all my problems. 
 
 Configure target Mysql server to allow old insecure auth. 
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_old-passwords 
 Simply in the my.cnf file on target Mysqld server comment out the old_passwords. 
 Maybe there is way to obtain PHP build (or build it yourself) which uses compatible (old) auth mode. 
 
 I ran into this error for the first time with a Media Temple db on a grid server.  
 The issue was caused because I used a password for a database user that was still in their old password format. The new format calls for 10+ characters, special characters, a number etc... 
 I created a new database user and password in the new format and it worked fine. 
 
 I had this issue when I imported a database from an older version of MySQL. The biggest problem - it was preventing me from connecting to MySQL with my root user, so I had to   by following the instructions below:

 Check if you use the correct credential 
 use this command to be sure that you change your pass : use characters ,numbers and letters (more than 10) 

 
 UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = PASSWORD('NewPassword') WHERE user = 'username'; 
 
 be sure that you comment oldpassword value in /etc/my.cnf  
 restart mysql service to avoid any other issues
