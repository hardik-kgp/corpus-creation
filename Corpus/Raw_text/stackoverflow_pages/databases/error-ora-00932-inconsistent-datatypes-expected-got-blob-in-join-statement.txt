 You cannot specify  DISTINCT  if the select_list contains LOB columns. 
 Try to use a scalar subquery to get the BLOB field. 
 
 Below restrictions are applied on the set operators.  
 
 The set operators are subject to the following restrictions: 
 **The set operators are not valid on columns of type BLOB, CLOB, BFILE,
  VARRAY, or nested table.**

 The UNION, INTERSECT, and MINUS operators are not valid on LONG
  columns. 
 If the select list preceding the set operator contains an expression,
  then you must provide a column alias for the expression in order to
  refer to it in the order_by_clause. 
 You cannot also specify the for_update_clause with the set operators. 
 You cannot specify the order_by_clause in the subquery of these
  operators. 
 You cannot use these operators in SELECT statements containing TABLE
  collection expressions.
