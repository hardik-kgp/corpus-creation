*** error-ora-00932-when-using-a-select-with-union-and-clob-fields ***

 First of all, this isn't a duplicate of  this  question. If it is, sorry but I couldn't solve my problem by reading it. 
 I'm getting this error: 
 
 When I try to execute this SELECT statement: 
 
 The selected field(t_txt) is of CLOB datatype. As you can see, it's the same column of the same table. This statement belongs to a bigger one, I've isolated the part where I'm having this problem. 
 Thank you very much. 
 
 I believe the problem is the use of   instead of  .  The   operator will combine the two sets  and eliminate duplicates .  Since CLOB types cannot be compared, the duplicate elimination part is not possible.   
 Using   won't attempt to do duplicate elimination (you probably don't have duplicates anyways) so it should work. 
 
 As I  had  duplicates, I couldn't use UNION ALL. This solution work perfectly, thank you! 
 BTW:
This is imho the only correct answer, because UNION ALL and UNION are semantically different. If don't have duplicates at all, using UNION imposes an unnecessary sort overhead.
