*** error-using-using ***

 I have an error 
 
 Type used in a using statement must be implicitly convertible to 'System.IDisposable' 
 
 on line 
 
 Here is my code: 
 
 The EntityContainer() looks like this... 
 
 EDIT: DbContext implements IDisposable and I cant edit EntityContainer() class since its generated from a template. 
 Any ideas what is wrong? 
 
 From  this answer : 
 
 The context still implements IDisposable, but if you're getting an error... complaining about not implementing IDisposable, then your problem is most likely that your model is defined in a separate assembly that references EF5 and you have not added an EF5 reference to your project. 
 
 
 The answer would be to add the EntityFramework assembly to the references 
 
 If you want to use   in an   statement, then it must implement  IDisposable 
 Try this: 
 
 
 I added entity framework to my calling project's references and it fixed my issue. 
 
 You could try to use the Unit of Work pattern, something like this. 
 
 Then your partial ObjectContext could implement the   interface: 
 
 This method allows me to use the using directive without errors.  Example of use (I use the Repository pattern in conjunction with this): 
 
 Hopefully this helps. 
 
 We have a page that throws this error and the   error. Entities are defined in a separate project, and all the necessary references appear to be used. 
 I've found that switching from Visual Studio 2012 to 2010 is sufficient when editing the page. It's definitely not ideal, but it works until we switch everything over to EF 5+. 
 
 If you are following the example in Chapter 23 of "Pro C# 5.0 and the .Net 4.5 Framework" using Visual Studio 2013 then just add the other DLLs in the AutoLotDAL folder as references.
