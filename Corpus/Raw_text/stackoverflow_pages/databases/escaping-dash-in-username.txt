*** escaping-dash-in-username ***

 I'm having difficulty modifying a postgres user that contains a dash in its name - I've run into this problem several times, but can never find the answer (no matter how much googling I do!). 
 
 osm=# grant all on osm_polygon_view to www-data; 
 ERROR:  syntax error at or near "-" 
 LINE 1: grant all on osm_polygon_view to www-data; 
 
 
 I have tried just about every permutation of escape characters and quotes, and still can't get this to work. I have also encountered this when trying to change www-data password. 
 
 Double quotes is what you should use - not single quotes. 
 
 grant all on osm_polygon_view to "www-data";
