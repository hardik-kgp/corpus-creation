 I'm currently using the script  
 
 However, it's not accurate, because the engine used by my MySQL tables is InnoDB (I only realised this could be an issue now, be these databases have existed for a while).  
 Is there any way to get an exact count of every row in every table of a database with MySQL? 
 Cheers. 
 
 I think the only accurate (and slower) way is to do for every single table: 
 
 
 This SQL statement will generate a union query that can complete the task in one step: 
 
 After running the SQL statement, just paste the output into a text editor, delete the word "UNION" from the end of the output, and you will have the union query. 
 Beware that running the union query could take a lot of resources depending on your database size, load, and hardware, so you may not want to run it all at once. 
 
 I was having the same problem which led me to this question. 
 Thanks to computerGuy12345's answer, I came up with a stored procedure that
does this without having to copy-paste. 
As he said, beware that this will scan each table and might take a while. 
 
 
  ,can not give the exact count of rows in a table , it wil give total row count+1 , wil give  the next data inserting row also. and one more thing is, in    the column_Name should be int ,if it is varchar or char sum function wont work. soo the best thing is use 
            to get exact number of rows in a table.

 **table_name**
 means number of tables which is present in "data base " 
 **table_rows**
 means number rows in each column  
 **table_schema**
 is the database name. from which data base you are looking for the counts 
 
 this worked for me 
 
 i have tested this code and its works 
 output 1145 for me
