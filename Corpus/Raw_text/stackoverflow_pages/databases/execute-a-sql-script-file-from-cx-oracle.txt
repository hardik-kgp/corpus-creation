*** execute-a-sql-script-file-from-cx-oracle ***

 Is there a way to execute a sql script file using cx_oracle in python.  
 I need to execute my create table scripts in sql files. 
 
 PEP-249 , which cx_oracle tries to be compliant with, doesn't really have a method like that. 
 However, the process should be pretty straight forward.  Pull the contents of the file into a string, split it on the ";" character, and then call .execute on each member of the resulting array.  I'm assuming that the ";" character is only used to delimit the oracle SQL statements within the file. 
 
 
 Another option is to use SQL*Plus (Oracle's command line tool) to run the script. You can call this from Python using the   module - there's a good walkthrough here:  http://moizmuhammad.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/run-oracle-commands-from-python-via-sql-plus/ . 
 For a script like   (note the deliberate error): 
 
 You can use a function like the following: 
 
  is the same connection string used for  .   is the full path to the script (e.g.  ). The function opens a SQL Plus session (with '-S' to silence its welcome message), then queues "@filename" to send to it - this will tell SQL Plus to run the script. 
  sends the command to stdin, waits for the SQL*Plus session to terminate, then returns (stdout, stderr) as a tuple. Calling this function with   above will give the following output: 
 
 This will take a little parsing, depending on what you want to return to the rest of your program - you could show the whole output to the user if it's interactive, or scan for the word "ERROR" if you just want to check whether it ran OK.
