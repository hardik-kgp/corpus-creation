 When debugging the the following method in a unit test I get the following error  
 
 Object reference not set to an instance of an object 
 
 when hitting the following line 
 
 The method is 
 
 
  return null if the result set is null according to MSDN. This means that your cast is invalid 
 See here for the documentation  SqlCommand.ExecuteScalar 
 If you want that cast to work change it to a nullable  
 
 
 I just experienced a similar problem. What I did was to select an int column from a specific record in a table, but it happened the value of that column is 0. Doing the following caused the exception “Object reference not set to an instance of an object”: 
 
 My solution was to change the above code to: 
 
 This avoided the exception. 
 
 ExecuteScalar: Executes the query, and returns the first column of the first row in the result set returned by the query. Additional columns or rows are ignored. 
 Try adding "SELECT CAST(scope_identity() AS int)" at the end of your query. 
 
 You are doing it rather wrong - try calling   for   results
