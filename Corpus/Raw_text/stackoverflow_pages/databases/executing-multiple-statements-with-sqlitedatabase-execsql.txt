*** executing-multiple-statements-with-sqlitedatabase-execsql ***

 I've followed a standard tutorial for building a database with Android.  I've created a class called DbHelper which extends SQLiteOpenHelper.  I've Overridden the create handler to execute a string. 
 
 DbDefinitions.DB_CREATE is a static String I've created. 
 
 I'd like to use 1 String to execute multiple SQL statements.  How can I do this as SQLiteDatabase.execSQL only allows 1 statement?

 Try something like this: 
 
 
 From the documentation of SQLiteDatabase and my experience in the past I think that it's not possible. But why don't you just split it up in single statements? It really is not a problem in your example. Or do you need it for a different use case? 
 
 we have many greate answers here.
and here is my solution for multiple insert statements, however I used a file in assets not in row, each line in this file is an insert statement.
