*** executing-set-of-sql-queries-using-batch-file ***

 I am using a SQL Server database. I have these SQL queries: 
 
 Is it possible to run these scripts using a batch file? The database is a remote database. 
 Thanks! 
 
 Save the commands in a   file, ex:  , say in your   folder. 
 **Contents of**
  
 
 Then use   to execute it as follows. Since you said the database is remote, use the following syntax (after updating for your server and database instance name). 
 
 For example, if your remote computer name is SQLSVRBOSTON1 and Database instance name is MyDB1, then the command would be. 
 
 Also note that   specifies default authentication. If you have a user name and password to connect, use   and   switches.  
 You will execute all this by opening a   command window. 
 **Using a Batch File.**

 If you want to save it in a batch file and double-click to run it, do it as follows. 
 Create, and save the   like so. 
 
 Then double-click it to run it. It will execute the commands and wait until you press a key to exit, so you can see the command output. 
 
 Check out SQLCMD command line tool that comes with SQL Server.  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162773.aspx 
 
 Use the  **SQLCMD**
 utility. 
 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162773.aspx 
 There is a connect statement that allows you to swing from database server A to server B in the same batch. 
 :Connect server_name[\instance_name] [-l timeout] [-U user_name [-P password]]
Connects to an instance of SQL Server. Also closes the current connection. 
 On the other hand, if you are familiar with  **PowerShell**
, you can programmatic do the same.

 Different ways: 
 
 Using SQL Server Agent (If local instance) 
schedule a job in sql server agent with a new step having type as "T-SQL" then run the job.
