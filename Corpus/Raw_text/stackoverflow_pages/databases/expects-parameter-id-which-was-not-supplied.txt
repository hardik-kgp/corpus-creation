 You seem to be calling a stored procedure - yet you've never  **defined**
 your   to be a stored procedure: 
 
 If you forget that line, then ADO.NET will try to interpret your stuff as an ad-hoc SQL statement.... 
 
 this one solve my problem 
may be it may helpful 
 
 
 Your ID parameter in the stored procedure must be set as OUTPUT parameter. You are just setting it in code not in stored procedure. 
 
 Hy guys. 
 You have to set the property CommandType for the Command to StoredProcedure if that's the case. Otherwise it woun't detect the parameters. 
 
 One other reason this error is thrown is when the variable names don't match in your stored procedure and code because the code fails to find the parameter to which the value must be passed. Make sure they match: 
 Stored procedure: 
 
 Code: 
 
 The parameter   must match in both code and stored procedure
