*** export-data-from-mysql-workbench-6-0 ***

 I'm trying to export my database, using MySQL Workbench 6.0 on Windows, to send to my db instance in Amazon RDS, but i'm getting this error: 
 
 Does anybody have any idea that can help me? 
 
 
 mysqldump: [ERROR] unknown variable 'delayed-insert=FALSE' 
 
 This error occurs on various systems and can be temporarily fixed by: 
 
 Going to the appropriate directory depending on the system: 
 a)  **Windows**
:   (32-bit installation on x64 systems:  ) 
 b)  **Mac OS X**
:   - right click on the app and select Show Package contents to get inside the app (thanks to  Bradley Flood ) 
 c)  **Linux Ubuntu**
:   (thanks to  Alessandro Lopes ) 
 Open file  
 Find line  
 Insert   at the begin of this line to comment it out 
 Save file and restart Workbench. 
 
 Tested on Windows 7 x64, MySQL 5.6.27 (MyISAM) & Workbench 6.3.5 x64. 
 Tested on OSX Yosemite 10.10.4, MySQL 5.5.27 (MyISAM), Workbench 6.3.5 build 201 CE x64. 
 
 This worked for me. 
 Edit the file C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE\modules\wb_admin_export_options.py (make sure you open your editor as administrator) 
 find the line: 
 **delayed-insert":["Write INSERT DELAYED statements rather than INSERT statements.","FALSE", "BOOL", ("5.0.0", "5.7.0")],**

 and put a hash “#” at the beginning of the line so that it looks like this: 
 **#    delayed-insert":["Write INSERT DELAYED statements rather than INSERT statements.","FALSE", "BOOL", ("5.0.0", "5.7.0")],**

 This will comment the line out so that Workbench won’t use this statement. 
 Save and close the file. 
 Start Workbench and try again.

 On Linux Ubuntu/Mint: 
 The config file is located at :
/usr/lib/mysql-workbench/modules/wb_admin_export_options.py 
 As described by c4pricorn, simply comment the line "delayed-insert":["Write INSERT DELAYED statements rather than...  
 And restart workbench. 
 
 Delayed inserts where deprecated in 5.6 and are converted to normal inserts in 5.7 (see also  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-delayed.html ). I wonder why mysqldump reports an error on this. Regardless, MySQL Workbench must be adjusted to no use   for dumps. Can you please file a bug report at  http://bugs.mysql.com  to bring this on the agenta for MySQL Workbench? 
 
 In CentOS 7, 
 Open file /usr/lib64/mysql-workbench/modules/wb_admin_export_options.py
Find line "delayed-insert":["Write INSERT DELAYED statements rather than ...
Insert # at the begin of this line to comment it out
Save file and restart Workbench. 
 
 As highlighted at an earlier post, by putting a # at the delayed-insert line in wb_admin_export_options.py does solves the problem.What i like to add is that when i tried to edit it in notepad and Pythonwin,i encountered the admin rights issue.They don't let me save the file after my edit.I finally work around it by editing and saving it in notepad++.One can download it from here  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/   
 
 Removing delayed-insert line in   solves the problem. You need to get admin rights to modify the file. 
 Nonetheless consider that your MySQL database might have been not properly upgraded before. 
 
 Be careful on editor: on Win7 64 notepad doesn't work on this modification.
Notepad will present a single line, use an editor with crlf. 
 
 I had this error until I upgraded to the latest version. Currently 8.0.15. That fixed it on my Mac.
