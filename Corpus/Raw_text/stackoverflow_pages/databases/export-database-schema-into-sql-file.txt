*** export-database-schema-into-sql-file ***

 Is it possible in   to export database structure into a   file?  
 I want to export not only tables schema but also primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, indexes, stored procedures, user defined types/functions.  
 Also I don't want the data to be present in this   file.  
 Is there any way to achieve that? 
 
 You can generate scripts to a file via SQL Server Management Studio, here are the steps: 
 
 Right click the database you want to generate scripts for (not the table) and select tasks  - generate scripts 
 Next, select the requested table/tables, views, stored procedures, etc (from select specific database objects) 
 Click advanced - select the types of data to script  
 Click Next and finish 
 
 MSDN Generate Scripts 
 When generating the scripts, there is an area that will allow you to script, constraints, keys, etc. From SQL Server 2008 R2 there is an Advanced Option under scripting: 
 
 
 
 In the picture you can see. In the set script options, choose the last option: Types of data to script you click at the right side and you choose what you want.
This is the option you should choose to export a schema and data 
 
 Have you tried the   (Right click, tasks, generate scripts) option in SQL Management Studio? Does that produce what you mean by a "SQL File"?
