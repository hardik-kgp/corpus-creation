*** export-postgresql-table-data-using-pgadmin ***

 I am using pgAdmin version 1.14.3. PostgreSQL database version is 9.1. 
 I got all Db script for table creation but unable to export all data inside tables. Could not find any option to export data in db script form. 
 
 Just right click on a table and select "backup". The popup will show various options, including "Format", select "plain" and you get plain SQL. 
 pgAdmin is just using  pg_dump  to create the dump, also when you want plain SQL. 
 It uses something like this:     
 
 pg_dump --user user --password --format=plain --table=tablename --inserts --attribute-inserts etc. 
 
 
 
 Right-click on your table and pick option  .. 
 On File Options, set Filepath/Filename and pick   for Format  
 Ignore Dump Options #1 tab 
 In Dump Options #2 tab, check  
 In Dump Options #2 tab, check   if you want column names in your inserts. 
 Hit   button 
 
 
 In the pgAdmin4, Right click on table select backup like this 
 
 After that into the backup dialog there is  **Dump options**
 tab into that there is section queries you can select  **Use Insert Commands**
 which include all insert queries as well in the backup.
