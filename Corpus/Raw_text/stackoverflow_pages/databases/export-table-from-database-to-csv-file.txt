*** export-table-from-database-to-csv-file ***

 I want to:
Export table from sql server database to a comma delimited   file without using sql Server import export wizard 
 I want to do it using a query because I want to use the query in automation 
 Is it possible? I searched for that and didn't find a good answer 
 
 Some ideas: 
 **From SQL Server Management Studio**

 
 **Using SQLCMD (Command Prompt)**

 Example: 
 From the command prompt, you can run the query and export it to a file: 
 
 More information here:  ExcelSQLServer 
 Notes: 
 
 This approach will have the "Rows affected" information in the bottom of the file, but you can get rid of this by using the "SET NOCOUNT ON" in the query itself. 
 You may run a stored procedure instead of the actual query (e.g. "EXEC Database.dbo.StoredProcedure") 
 You can use any programming language or even a batch file to automate this 
 
 **Using BCP (Command Prompt)**

 Example: 
 
 It is important to quote the comma separator as -t',' vs just -t, 
 More information here:  bcp Utility 
 Notes: 
 
 As per when using SQLCMD, you can run stored procedures instead of the actual queries 
 You can use any programming language or a batch file to automate this 
 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 Here is an option  I found  to export to Excel (can be modified for CSV I believe) 
 
 
 You can also use following Node.js module to do it with ease:

 **From SQL Server Management Studio**

 Right click the table you want to export and select "Select All Rows" 
 Right click the results window and select "Save Results As..." 
 
 
 
 I wrote a small tool that does just that. Code is available  on github . 
 To dump the results of one (or more) SQL queries to one (or more) CSV files:

 Dead horse perhaps, but a while back I was trying to do the same and came across a script to create a STP that tried to do what I was looking for, but it had a few quirks that needed some attention. In an attempt to track down where I found the script to post an update, I came across this thread and it seemed like a good spot to share it. 
 This STP (Which for the most part I take no credit for, and I can't find the site I found it on), takes a schema name, table name, and Y or N [to include or exclude headers] as input parameters and queries the supplied table, outputting each row in comma-separated, quoted, csv format.  
 I've made numerous fixes/changes to the original script, but the bones of it are from the OP, whoever that was. 
 Here is the script: 
 
 
 In SQL Server Management Studio query window 
 
 Select All result set values 
 Right Click and Select "Save Results As"  
 
 
 
 Save as CSV file
