 I have a project with a derby database in it.  
 I want to be able to make a backup or export the database so I can give it with the project files to my lecturer. 
 
 By default, the database resides in your home folder under   (this folder may be hidden under Windows). Copying this folder will work, but your lecturer will have to "register" this copied location with his IDE. To do this: 
 
 Under  , open the   node. 
 Right-click on   and select properties. 
 In the   field, enter the path to the copied folder. 
 
 
 There are lots of ways to backup and/or export data in a Derby database: here's a link to the docs:  http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.9/adminguide/cadminparttwo.html 
 In order to make the backup, you have to find the database data on disk. It will all be located in a single folder/directory; that folder/directory is named using the name of your database. So if your database is jdbc:derby:brydb, look for a folder named 'brydb'. 
 
 Late, but it may be useful for others: 
 
 In Netbeans, start a connection to your database. 
 Right click on it and select 'Execute command' 
 Write this:
 
 
 Remember to write the name of your table and path between simple quotation marks ' '

 Let me suggest how to export sql scripts' file(after connection to db).
So that,go to 
 **1. Services -> Data base -> link -> Schema ->tables -> MYDB.**

 **2. Rightclick on MYDB and select 'Browse data'. And then click 'execute sql' 
 first icon/button**

 **3. In the list of rows below rightclick any of them, and choose "Show scenario for Create.." Sometimes output/logs window may overlay that list though. In such case close it please.**

 **4. Copypast(cntrl-c,cntrl-v) instruction from popup window  to a prepared by you previously txt file**

 **5. Again click  any of bottom list's rows. Select all of them  by cntrl-a keys' combination.  Rightclick and select "Show scenario for INSERT.."**

 **6. Copy instruction from popup window and past/add them   to mentioned above txt file**

 You are done with sql scripts' file.
