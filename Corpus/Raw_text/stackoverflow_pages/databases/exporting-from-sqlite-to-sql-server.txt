*** exporting-from-sqlite-to-sql-server ***

 Is there a tool to migrate an  SQLite  database to  SQL Server  (both the structure and data)? 
 
 SQLite  does have a .dump option to run at the command line. Though I prefer to use the  SQLite Database Browser  application for managing SQLite databases. You can export the structure and contents to a .sql file that can be read by just about anything. File > Export > Database to SQL file. 
 
 I know that this is old thread, but I think that this solution should be also here. 
 
 Install ODBC driver for SQLite 
 Run odbcad32 for x64 or C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe for x86 
 Create SYSTEM DSN, where you select SQLite3 ODBC Driver 
 Then you fill up form where Database Name is filepath to sqlite database 
 
 Then in SQL Server run under sysadmin 
 
 Then you can run your queries as normal user
e.g. 
 
 or you can use something like  this  for larger tables. 
 
 The SQLite   command will output the entire contents of the database as an ASCII text file. This file is in standard SQL format, so it can be imported into any SQL database.

 **sqlite-manager**
, firefox add-on: allows you to export an SQLite database in a SQL script.

 (Correction firefox 35 bugg obliged to correct the extension code as indicate to the following web page: 
 How to fix your optional sqlite manager module to work ) 
 **Command line**

 exports the sqlite database in a SQL script.  
 From url :  http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/sqlite . 
 
 A idea is do some thing like this:
- View squema in sql lite and get the CREATE TABLE command.
- Execute, parsing sql, in SQL SERVER
- Travel data creating a INSERT statment for each row. (parsing sql too) 
 This code is beta, because no detect type data, and no use @parameter and command object, but run. 
 (You need insert reference and install System.Data.SQLite;)
