*** factorygirl-faker-same-data-being-generated-for-every-object-in-db-seed-data ***

 I am using FactoryGirl and Faker to generate user objects in my   file but for some reason the exact same user is being created and   is failing because of an email uniqueness validation. 
 Factory for users: 
 
 And the code in   file: 
 
 Error: 
 
 If I open the console and use   I get the same results...same object is being created over and over even though if I run just   several times I'll get several e-mails. 
 FactoryGirl: 
 
 Faker by itself: 
 
 What am I missing here? Why is Faker producing the same data every time when used through FactoryGirl? 
 
 You need to pass a block if you want the values re-evaluated for each instance created. 
 Instead of  
 
 try... 
 
 
 Using Faker to get uniqueness-passing attributes may be an anti-pattern. It may also be a bad idea to have Faker's semi-random output in tests - what if sometimes tests just fail and you are off to a wild goose chase just because Faker coughed up a value you did not expect? 
 Lately I have been using FactoryGirl's sequences to get predictable, yet uniqueness-passing values.
