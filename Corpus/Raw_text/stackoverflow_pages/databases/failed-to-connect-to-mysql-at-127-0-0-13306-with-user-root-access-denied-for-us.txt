*** failed-to-connect-to-mysql-at-127-0-0-13306-with-user-root-access-denied-for-us ***

 I've been trying to create a new database connection on workbench. However, every time I test a connection there is an error message that says 
 
 Failed to connect to mysql at 127.0.0.1:3306 with user root access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'(using password:YES)  
 
 I don't know what's the cause of this error. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing my workbench 6.1 and mysql server 5.6 but the error is still unsolved. 
 
 First check if it's a workbench or connection problem. 
 1) In your windows run 'cmd' to open a terminal 
 Try both 
 2a)  
 2b)  
 3) If the connection is good you will get a password prompt, see if you can connect with correct password. 
 If your connection is denied, just grant the permission 
 
 If your connection is accepted here, it's like a workbench configuration problem. 
 
 I had the same problem.  
I've installed fresh mysql at Ubuntu but I left mysql password empty, and as a result I couldn't connect to mysql in any way.  
Lately I've revealed that there is a table of users where are names, hosts, passwords and some plugins. So for my user root@localhost mysql while installing assigned a plugin called  **auth_socket**
, which let Unix user "root" log in as a mysql user "root" without password, but don't allow login as another Unix user. So to fix that you should turn off this plugin and set usual authentication: 
 
 open Linux terminal 
 enter " **sudo mysql**
" 
you will see "mysql >" which means you've connected to mysql as a 'root' Unix user and you can type SQL queries. 
 enter SQL query to change a way how you will log in: 
 **ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_new_password';**

where 'mysql_native_password' means - to turn off auth_socket plugin. 
 
 
 Try this, it worked for me! 
 
 Inside the terminal enter: 
 
 Then in the MySQL Workbench edit the connection and change the root name to admin. 
 
 
 In Ubuntu systems running MySQL 5.7 (and later versions), the root MySQL user is set to authenticate using the  **auth_socket plugin**
 by default rather than with a password. This allows for some greater security and usability in many cases,  **but it can also complicate things when you need to allow an external program (e.g., phpMyAdmin) to access the user.**

 If you prefer to use a password when connecting to MySQL as  **root**
, you will need to switch its authentication method from  **auth_socket**
 to  **mysql_native_password**
. 
   source 
 
 Open up the MySQL prompt from your terminal: 
 
 Next, check which authentication method each of your MySQL user accounts use with the following command: 
 
 You will see that the root user does in fact authenticate using the auth_socket plugin. To configure the root account to authenticate with a password, run the following   command. Be sure to change password to a strong password of your choosing: 
 
 Then, run   which tells the server to reload the grant tables and put your new changes into effect: 
 
 Check the authentication methods employed by each of your users again to confirm that root no longer authenticates using the  **auth_socket plugin**
: 
 
 You will see in output that the root MySQL user now authenticates using a password. 
 
 no idea how this happened, but i had the same problem.  I had to reset my root password:
 http://www.jovicailic.org/2012/04/reset-forgotten-mysql-root-password-under-windows/ 
 But after my databases that i had previously were either dropped or the new connection did not connect to them.  Either way i couldn't access them via workbench.  But i could use MySQL again, which was a win for me 
 
 You should install the mysql server which hosts in your localhost. Then install the workbench. Still if you are getting the error GOTO: 
 (In MAC:) 
 System preferences>Mysql(Will be listed at the bottom,else server is not installed in your machine). 
 Check server status and start the Mysql server. 
 Try connecting to localhost with default port number. 
 
 i just encountered this problem now and with some tries i figured out that  **visiting services >> select MySQLxx service , then right click and hit start**
 , that solved my problem and everything is working without the need to loss data. 
 
 Try this, 
 I hope this will help You 
 
 Uninstalled everything including installer from it's own uninstall option. 
 Un-installed all the programs that were in any way related to mysql 
 Deleted the mysql folder from C:\Program Files 
 Deleted the mysql folder from C:\ProgramData  
 Cleared my registry and then re-installed the program, but all in vain. 
 
 How to repeat:
Here is what I did: 
 
 Installed it with mysql-installer-web-community-5.6.23.0.msi 
 For my purposes I selected "Custom" install with MySQL servers 5.6.22 - X64 and MySQL Connectors -> Connector ODBC/5.3.4 - 64 
 Next -> Execute -(ready to configure) -> Next 
 Config type: Development machine, all defaults (TCP/IP, Port: 3306, Open firewall) 
 Typed in MySQL Root Password 
 MySQL user Accounts -> Add user (username, password, OK) -> Next 
 Configure MySQL Server as a Windows Service (CHECKED) 
 Windows Service Name: MySQL56 (default) 
 Start the MySQL Serve at System Startup 
 THIS IS CRUCIAL (BUG IS HERE): Run Service as... Standard System Account (CHECKED - but it will be disregarded and that is BUG) 
 Next -> Execute, Installation hangs on Starting server, so wait for a while to time out (or don't, your choice). When Dialog (might be covered with other windows) popup with message "Configuration of MySQL Server is taking longer than expected..., here click OK (so to wait longer) 
 
 Suggested fix:
12. Meanwhile go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services -> find MySQL56, right click on it -> Properties -> select Log On Tab AND HERE IS BUG -> Although Local System Account was selected, Somehow "This account: Network Service (with some password) was selected -> Select Log on as: Local System Account, Allow service to interact with desktop -> Apply -> Go back on general tab 
 
 On general tab click on "Start" button to start service and here it is! Service is started! Click on OK to close MySQL56 Properties dialog. Close Services dialog. Close Administrative tools. Close control panel. 
 And by that time (while you were closing those dialogs) when you look at MySQl Installer Dialog all steps are finished and checked: Starting Server, Applying security... Creating user accounts.. Updating Start menu link 
 Confirm with Finish -> Next -> Finish
That's it, happy MySQL-ing :)

 After viewing so many solution answers, here is my summary which works for me.
I only installed workbench 6.2 at first, when connecting to localhost it failed. 
 step1: check if you have installed mysql server. If not, download and install. 
 step2: the mysql server configuration recommend strong password, ignore it, choose the legacy password. 
 step3: start mysql server (windows system: services-->mysql-->start) 
 step4: open workbench and create local connection. 
 
 I know this is old but I have come across this issue as well but found a fix for this that worked for me: 
 
 go to "Services" 
 under "Name" find your username 
 right click and select "Start" 
 
 Go to your MySQL workbench and select "Startup / Shutdown" under "INSTANCE" and you should be good to go. Hope this helps anyone that comes across this. 
 
 Go to the search bar on your Windows and search for  **Services**
.
Launch  **Services**
 and look for  **MySQL**
**xx**
 ( xx  depends on your MySQL version) in the long list of services.  **Right-click**
 on MySQLxx and hit  **Start**
. 
MySQL should work fine now. 
 
 this could happen due to version issues . I had the same issue and I downgraded my mySQL work bench and tried it. it worked. 
 
 
 sudo mysql -u root -p 
 mysql > ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'abc@123'; 
 sudo mysql-workbench 
 
 
 I was facing the same problem in windows. 
 
 Goto services in task manager 
 start the service called MySQL80 
 Restart workbench 
 
 
 Well i had this problem, during an installation on Mac os, i tried multiple times to remove mysql 8.O and reinstall, for my vintage mac the only solution that i found was to take the CAKEBREW services and download a 5.7 mysql + an old Mysql Workbench 5. also, all is working perfectly, i will wait until somebody fix this problem.  
 I hope you found an other solution . 
 
 i changed default password from " " with space to blank 
 
 Here was my solution: 
 
 press Ctrl + Alt + Del 
 Task Manager 
 Select the Services Tab 
 Under name, right click on "MySql" and select Start
