*** fatal-error-execution-time-of-30-seconds-exceeded-in-phpmyadmin ***

 I have a MySQL table which contains 6.5 million records. When I try to access that table from phpMyAdmin I get: 
 
 Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in C:\xampp-new\phpMyAdmin\libraries\display_tbl.lib.php on line 1457. 
 
 I am just trying to view the records and I am not doing any query which might cause the error. 
 This problem is only in my server. And my local machine does not contain as many records as the server. 
 In my   I have already set the maximum execution time to maximum. 
 How do I fix this error? 
 
 Add this line 
 
 to  **phpmyadmin/config.inc.php**

 And Change  **php.ini**
 and  **my.ini**

 
 post_max_size = 750M  
 upload_max_filesize = 750M    
 max_execution_time = 5000 
 max_input_time = 5000 
 memory_limit = 1000M 
 max_allowed_packet = 200M (in my.ini) 
 
 
 +1 for making me lookup  lakhs . That looks like a PHP timeout to me as the  default timeout is 30 seconds . Increase the setting in your php.ini and restart apache and see if the timeout persists. 
 http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-execution-time 
 
 if you are using xammp on the xammp control panel at the apache line click on config and then click to open PHP(php.ini) find and increase max_execution_time=30 to max_execution_time=600.  
 
 This solution has resolved the issue
Place the following lines at the top of the script page and before the query that initiates the memory: 
 
 
 you need to set max_execution_time in php.ini 
 max_execution_time=6000 
 HAPPY CODING
