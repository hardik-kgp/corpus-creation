*** fatal-no-pg-hba-conf-entry-for-host-fe801lo0 ***

 Can someone help me why this is happening when I'm trying to connect to database or  ? 
 In my pg_hba.conf file I have this: 
 
 Maybe I'm doing it wrong? 
 Thanks 
 
 I had the same problem.  somehow, this line was added to my /etc/hosts file: 
 
 commenting out or removing that line from /etc/hosts should fix it 
 
 
 I'm on OSX 10.9.3 and Postgres 9.3.4. 
 I've managed to resolve this problem in the following way: 
 First find your   file by starting up psql with   and executing  : 
 
 Now add the following line to  : 
 
 and reload the configuration via   within  . 
 Now you should be able to connect via  . 
 
 Oo, that's an interesting one. 
 Assuming you're connecting to   (you didn't say and didn't show your  ), it appears that   is resolving to  an IPv6 link-local address with zone index . 
 If you use   or   it should work. 
 This is very likely an operating system misconfiguration or bug, so lots more detail (see comment above) should be added to the question if you want any concrete advice on that. 
 
 For me, the cause was calling  .  
 I bound the rails server to port 80 so that I wouldn't have to specify a port in the url   during development.  This appears to write   to my   file. 
 Try commenting out the line in your hosts file, then running  
 
 Actually, 
 The same error occurs for me when I execute   command to take backup of my server database (external) like below 
 
 I solved it (work around) by replacing my   to my actual server IP ( ).  
 So the issue here is my system didn't understand the   host.  
 It might solve permanently when you add   host in /private/etc/hosts file. 
 
 Another variant: if IPv6 is not used in the network, you can just disable it. On Windows IPv6 service also can be disabled.
