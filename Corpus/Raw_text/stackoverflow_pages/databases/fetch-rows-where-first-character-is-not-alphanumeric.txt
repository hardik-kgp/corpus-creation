*** fetch-rows-where-first-character-is-not-alphanumeric ***

 I am adding a few new features to a small project i'm working on and one of them is alpha pagination which looks like 
 
 # 0-9 A B C D E ... X Y Z 
 
 I can easily fetch items by their first letter using something like 
 
 Grouping everything that starts with a number and all other characters is a little more difficult, I assume it would have to use MySQLs REGEXP. 
 Just to be clear, I need help creating two queries which will fetch all rows where 
 
 the first character of a column is numeric 
 the first character of a column is not alphanumeric 
 
 
 First character is numeric: 
 
 First character is not alphanumeric: 
 
 (Note that this is distinct from  , because you seem to  only  want to match when there  is  in fact a first character.) 
 You can probably substitute   for  , but I haven't tested it. You can  certainly  substitute   for  , but it's longer. :-) 
 Also see the  MySQL REGEXP Reference .
