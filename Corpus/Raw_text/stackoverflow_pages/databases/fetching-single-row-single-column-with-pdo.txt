*** fetching-single-row-single-column-with-pdo ***

 I have a mysql query that targets a single column in a single row  
 
 After I execute the statement   how do I get this single cell directly placed into a variable with no loops? In other words how to get  
 
 I tried the 2 below, but neither worked.. The column is number 4 in the original table, but I'm assuming since in my select statement I'm selecting it only, it should be 1 when I specify the parameter for fetchColumn.  
 
 As you can see, I'm trying to do it in as few lines as possible.  
 
 Are you sure it's returning any rows?  
   
is correct way to fetch a single value, so either you probably didn't bind the :user parameter or it simply returned no rows. 
 
 
 
 I'm not sure why so many people mess this up: 
 
 Make sure that you are selecting a specific   in the query and not   or you will need to specify the column order number in  , example:   That usually isn't a good idea because the columns in the database may be reorganized by, someone...  
 This will only work properly with  ;   will not return an array. 
 
 Have you prepared the statement first? (Before  ) 
 
 
 You could use this:
