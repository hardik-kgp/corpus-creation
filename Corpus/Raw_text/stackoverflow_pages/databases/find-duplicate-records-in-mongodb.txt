*** find-duplicate-records-in-mongodb ***

 How would I find duplicate fields in a mongo collection. 
 I'd like to check if any of the "name" fields are duplicates. 
 
 Many thanks! 
 
 Use aggregation on   and get   with  : 
 
 To sort the results by most to least duplicates: 
 
 To use with another column name than "name", change " **$name**
" to " **$column_name**
" 
 
 You can find the   of   names using the following   pipeline: 
 
  all the records having similar  . 
  those   having records greater than  . 
 Then   again to   all the duplicate names as an  . 
 
 The Code:

 The answer anhic gave can be very inefficient if you have a large database and the attribute name is present only in some of the documents. 
 To improve efficiency you can add a $match to the aggregation. 
 
 
 
 First Group Query the group according to the fields.  
 Then we check the unique Id and count it, If count is greater then 1 then the field is duplicate in the entire collection so that thing is to be handle by $match query.
