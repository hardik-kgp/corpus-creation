*** find-duplicate-rows-with-postgresql ***

 We have a table of photos with the following columns:  
 
 this table contains duplicate values for the combination  . so it's possible that one row appears more several times.

 I see a couple of options for you.   
 For a quick way of doing it, use something like this (it assumes your ID column is not unique as you mention 234 multiple times above): 
 
 Here is the  SQL Fiddle . 
 You will need to add your constraints back to the table if you have any.   
 If your ID column is unique, you could do something like to keep your lowest id: 
 
 And the  Fiddle .
