 Is it possible to find out who called a store procedure?  
 For example, say I get an error in  . From within that proc I want to know if it was called by   or  . 
 
 I would use an extra input parameter, to specify the source, if this is important for your logic. 
 This will also make it easier to port your database to another platform, since you don't depend on some obscure platform dependent function. 
 
 Do you need to know in proc3 at runtime which caused the error, or do you just need to know while debugging? 
 You can use  SQL Server profiler  if you only need to do it during debugging/monitoring. 
 Otherwise in 2005 I don't believe you have the ability to stack trace. 
 To work around it you could add and extra parameter to proc3, @CallingProc or something like that.  
 OR you could add try catch blocks to proc1 and proc2.

 SQL Server 2008 does have the ability to debug through procedures however. 
 
 There is no nice automatic way to do this (alas).  So it really depends on how much you are prepared to (re)write your procs in order to be able to do this.   
 If you have a logging mechanism, you might be able to read the log and work out who called you.   
 For example, if you implement logging by inserting to a table, for example:  
 
 This wouldn't work for recursive calls, but perhaps someone can fix that?   
 
 You could have proc1 and proc2 pass their names into proc3 as a parameter. 
 For example:
