*** find-rows-that-have-the-same-value-on-a-column-in-mysql ***

 In a [member] table, some rows have the same value for the   column. 
 
 Some people used a different login_id but the same email address, no unique constraint was set on this column. Now I need to find these rows and see if they should be removed.

 Thanks guys :-) I used the below because I only cared about those two columns and not so much about the rest. Worked great 
 
 
 Get the entire record as you want using the condition with inner select query.
