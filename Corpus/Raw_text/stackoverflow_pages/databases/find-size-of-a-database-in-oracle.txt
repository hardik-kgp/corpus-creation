*** find-size-of-a-database-in-oracle ***

 I have a database named "My_Enterprise_Data". I need to find the size that it occupies on the disk.  
 How do I find it out? 
 Is the query,   run against the My_Enterprise_Data correct? 
 
 The following will show you the data files used by oracle: 
 
 You can then look for the tablespace used by the My_Enterprise_Data schema 
 
 An oracle database consists of data files, redo log files, control files, temporary files. 
The size of the database actually means the total size of all these files. 
 
 
 
 
 there is two ways to calculate the Database size in Oracle, 
 one is from os side and another is by login to datbase, 
 You also can see here the details procedure for both ways 
 
 Great... dba_segments gives the Oracle  database size 
 To find the actual space occupied by the database. 
 Select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 from dba_segments;
