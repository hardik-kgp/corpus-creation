*** findrowcount-doesnt-work-when-bean-has-property-with-formula-annotation ***

 I have following class: 
 
 It has   field (play framework will generate getters and setters automatically). And also   uses this field in   clause. Now if I do 
 
 It will throw   while trying to execute query 
 
 Looks like   doesn't recognize join in   annotation. Any thoughts on how to work around this problem? 
 **Updated question:**
 narrowed down problem to   call. 
 
 So you want the count without using  findRowCount()  method and without fetching all the data .. 
 **Solution**
: Copy the same query, and make it on the form   and use it to find the count 
 **Example**
: 
 If your query is on the form .. 
 **Query**
:  
 Then this line of code   will be equivlant to .. 
 **Count Query**
:  
 
 One possible way could be use  **findlist()**
 method and use its  **size()**
 method to get number of rows instead of  **findRowCount()**
 method 
 
 return Client.find.where().gt("totalOrdersAmount", 0).findList().size(); 
 
 
 You should debug this and see what you're missing.  It's either a bug as described, or you somehow are not at all referencing what you think you are.  We've all been there though, but if you can breakpoint at that line and see your object, just make sure everything is what you expected to look like.  As soon as you add trying to deal with database fields and referencing them, misspellings for instance cause many headaches.
