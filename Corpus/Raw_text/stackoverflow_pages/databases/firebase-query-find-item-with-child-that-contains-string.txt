*** firebase-query-find-item-with-child-that-contains-string ***

 I'm having a bit of trouble with a Firebase Query. I want to query for objects, where the objects child value contains a certain string. So far I have something that looks like this:  
 
 But that only gives objects that have a starting value of "b". I want objects that contains the string "b". How do I do that? 
 
 There are no contains or fuzzy matching methods in the query API, which you have probably already guessed if you've scanned  the API  and  the guide on queries . 
 Not only has this subject been discussed ad nauseam on SO [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ], but I've touched several times on why one should  use a real search engine , instead of attempting this sort of half-hearted search approach.  
 There is a reason it's often easier to Google a website to find results than to use the built-in search, and this is a primary component of that failure. 
 With all of that said, the answer to your question of how to do this manually, since there is no built-in contains, is to set up a server-side process that loads/streams data into memory and does manual searching of the contents, preferably with some sort of caching.  
 But honestly, ElasticSearch is faster and simpler, and more efficient here. Since that's a vast topic, I'll defer you to the  blog post on this subject .
