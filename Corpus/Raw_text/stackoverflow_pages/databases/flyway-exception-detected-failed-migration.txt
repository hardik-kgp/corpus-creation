 I've got a Flyway exception: 
 
 I looked for on documentation and forums but I didn't found what mean this exception.
Please someone can tell me what can be the reasons of these exception !
Thanks 
 
 
 "FlywayException: Detected failed migration to version 1.0" 
 
 it means that you ran migrate before and it failed at 1.0 for some reason. You need to identify why the previous migration failed at 1.0 and solve it if you have already not done so.
Once solved you need to run   to tell flyway that whatever failed is now out of the way.  
 Then run   again. If it fails again, you are back on step 1.
Good luck with the migration.  
 
 Make  
 
 you will get something like this:  
 Query to flyway_schema_history table
 
 Then find the entry that corresponds to the migration that is failing and delete it, it should work.
