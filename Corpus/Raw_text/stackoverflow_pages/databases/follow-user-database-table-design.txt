*** follow-user-database-table-design ***

 I'm trying to determine the best table design for a "follow/unfollow user" feature, similar to Twitter  **(edit:**
 I'm not making a Twitter-like application.) Below is my the current table design and php handling. I'm not certain if it's the best approach and would really appreciate your feedback. 
 
 On follow, the followers id is added to the   field and the id of the user that will be followed is added to  . I'm also recording the date a user subscribed to follow another user in the   field. The date of subscription might be used for sorting. 
 When a user unfollows, I simply delete the respective row.  
 In order to prevent duplicate rows I made columns   and   unique. If a user is already following an id and clicks to follow again, I get database error 1062. For instance  
 
 Duplicate entry '62-88' for key 'follow_unique' 
 
 Obviously when already following a user, the follower sees a   button. This is achieved by checking if a follower-following table row exists between 2 users. If   I display   otherwise  . 
 Well, what do you think? 
 
 I think it's a very good design, and should meet your needs nicely.  One thing; you should probably make the   and   foreign keys.  Oh, and for simplicity sake, I'd make the   column   just to capture the datetime the user subscribed. 
 
 I would suggest you make follower and following together the primary key. There is no need for a seperate   field.
