*** foo-foo-is-giving-a-table-column-the-same-name-as-the-table-itself-a-bad-idea ***

 I have a very simple table called  , which looks like this: 
 
  has values like "narrative", "myth", and so on. 
  seems like a silly name for the column. The column could be called   or   or  . But it seems redundant.  
 So, is there any reason not to just go ahead and call it  ?  
 **EDIT:**
  
 The bottom line is that it's better to use  . Thanks everyone! 
 
 It sounds like you're modeling a genre entity. Examples horror, drama, romance. Is this correct? 
 Would you be comfortable in calling your  's column  ? 
 
 This column should be called 'Name' as this is Genre name.  
 
 Why not name the column "category"?  Giving your "genre" table a "genre" column seems to say that your genre has a genre, which makes no sense.  Rather, a genre has a name or type or category or whatever, so you should name it accordingly.
