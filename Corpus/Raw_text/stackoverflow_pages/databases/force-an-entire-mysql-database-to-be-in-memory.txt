*** force-an-entire-mysql-database-to-be-in-memory ***

 For the purposes of running a large number of tests that interact with the database, I want to do two things: 
 
 I would like to copy the schema of a database without copying its data. I can do this with a script that grabs the CREATE TABLE statements from each table in the database. 
 Upon creating this database, I would like to force it to be 100% in memory. 
 
 I'm stuck on how to do part 2 - Is there an easier way to do this other than specifying each table's engine? Somehow that seems like a poor way of doing it. 
 
 Create the database in   (ubuntu|debian) and it will be in RAM. It can grow up to 0.5 of available memory. 
 
 As  dtmilano  said, you can put it on a tmpfs mounted filesystem. It doesn't have to be /dev/shm, but that is one place where tmpfs is usually mounted. 
 You can create a new one anywhere, though: 
 
 If it fills all your available RAM, it will use swap as a backup. 
 Put it in /etc/fstab to re-mount on boot. Just remember, it's a ram disk, so it starts out empty every time you reboot. See:  http://www.howtoforge.com/storing-files-directories-in-memory-with-tmpfs 
 Alternately, as suggested by  yuxhuang  you can create a table of type  . It also empties on restart, though the table definition remains. The   table type has a few restrictions, though. It uses fixed-size rows, for example, so   and    columns are not allowed, and   isn't variable length. See:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html 
 
 
 This is going to set the default storage engine for the current session. 
 
 If you are using Windows, in your database creation script you can create the tables adding the MEMORY parameter like this:
