*** free-open-translation-databases ***

 Are there any open/free downloadable translation databases, besides wiktionary? 
 (any language welcome) 
 
 You could try contacting  IATE .
It's the European Union's database and it might be readily available. It being the EU you might have to wade through a couple of Red Seas of tape though :) 
 Another good source could be  Glosbe , who are trying to build a large dict based on translation memories. According to their about section they allow downloads of the translation memories as well, so try contacting them. 
 
 You can download in OmegaWiki. See:  http://www.omegawiki.org/ 
 
 The aim of our project is to create a dictionary of all words of all
  languages, including lexical, terminological and ontological
  information. Our data is available in a relational database, as a
  result it is possible to use the data for many purposes. 
 
 
 Have you tried  Babel Eclipse  it has a very interesting translation pack, if you need to translate you can also use  Google Translation FAmily 
 
 Wondering what "have a nice day" looks
  like written in Hindi? You can use
  Google Transliterate to transform a
  given written language into dozens of
  other scripts. 
 
 
 Here's one simple approach for quickly getting the translations you're looking for: 
 
 Get all the words & phrases you want into a text file, where each "translation target" is on a its own line 
 Use  https://translate.google.com  to simultaneously translate entire block for each language with 1 click 
 Copy/Paste results into spreadsheet, where each column can be for a different language translation
