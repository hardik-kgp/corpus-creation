 Hi I am developing desktop portable free application and I`m looking for portable database: 
 
 free 
 without install 
 up to 20K records 
 standalone application 
 supports encryption (optional) 
 SQL92 spec 
 
 thanks for advice 
 can you write some advantages and disadvangtages?  
 
 SQLite: 
 
 self-contained, serverless,
  zero-configuration, transactional SQL
  database engine. SQLite is the most
  widely deployed SQL database engine in
  the world. The source code for SQLite
  is in the public domain.

 Firebird embedded 
 About: 
 
 Firebird is an open source relational
  database offering many ANSI SQL-99
  features that runs on Linux, Windows,
  and a variety of Unix platforms.
  Firebird offers excellent concurrency,
  high performance, powerful language
  support for stored procedures and
  triggers. 
 
 
 If you're working in Java,  HSQLDB  might be a good fit. Otherwise, SQLite. 
 
 SQL Server Compact 
 
 Not sure it meets the no install requirement but if you need more than SQLite check  Apache Derby . 
 
 Depending on your problem, you may consider Ms Access.  
 You can connect to Access database through Jet engine which is installed on Windows XP and newer. 
 Since v2002 it is SQL 92 compliant (as Microsoft  claims ). 
 
 Tokyo Cabinet  would be a good candidate, except it isn't relational (so no SQL). 
Given you don't have so many records, maybe a full relational database is overkill for your needs. Or not, it depends on your application, of course. 
 
 Edit: Ooops, apparently I meant  SQL Compact , not  express
