 How to use  H2 database 's integrated managment frontend? 
 For operations such as create table, alter table, add column, and so on. 
 
 I like  SQuirreL SQL Client , and  NetBeans  is  very useful ; but more often, I just fire up the built-in   and browse port 8082: 
 
$ java -cp /opt/h2/bin/h2.jar org.h2.tools.Server -help
Starts the H2 Console (web-) server, TCP, and PG server.
Usage: java org.h2.tools.Server 
When running without options, -tcp, -web, -browser and -pg are started.
Options are case sensitive. Supported options are:
[-help] or [-?]         Print the list of options
[-web]                  Start the web server with the H2 Console
[-webAllowOthers]       Allow other computers to connect - see below
[-webPort ]       The port (default: 8082)
[-webSSL]               Use encrypted (HTTPS) connections
[-browser]              Start a browser and open a page to connect to the web server
[-tcp]                  Start the TCP server
[-tcpAllowOthers]       Allow other computers to connect - see below
[-tcpPort ]       The port (default: 9092)
[-tcpSSL]               Use encrypted (SSL) connections
[-tcpPassword ]    The password for shutting down a TCP server
[-tcpShutdown ""]  Stop the TCP server; example: tcp://localhost:9094
[-tcpShutdownForce]     Do not wait until all connections are closed
[-pg]                   Start the PG server
[-pgAllowOthers]        Allow other computers to connect - see below
[-pgPort ]        The port (default: 5435)
[-baseDir ]        The base directory for H2 databases; for all servers
[-ifExists]             Only existing databases may be opened; for all servers
[-trace]                Print additional trace information; for all servers
 
 
 How about the  H2 console application ? 
 
 I use  sql-workbench  for working with H2 and any other DBMS I have to deal with and it makes me smile :-) 
 
 I would like to suggest  DBEAVER  .it is based on eclipse and supports better data handling

 There's a shell client built in too which is handy.

 I haven't used it, but  RazorSQL   looks  pretty good. 
 
 If you are running it as an embedded database in spring I use the following configuration to enable the built in web client when the main app is running: 
 
 
 I use DbVisualizer a lot for H2-db administration.  
 There exists a free version:

 I would suggest Jetbrain's IDE: DataGrip  https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/
