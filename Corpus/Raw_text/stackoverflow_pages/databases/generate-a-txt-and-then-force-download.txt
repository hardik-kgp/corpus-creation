 I have a php function for getting info out of my database. When they go to  http://example.com/test/download 
 I want to create a fake test.txt (text is dynamic) and download it. It's contents should be the equivalent of executing   inside of it. 
 How can I get started on this? (Using php) 
 
 You can link to a php document along these lines, which forces a download of type plain text. (Well, suggests to the browser that that should happen, at any rate.) 
 
 Of course, pass in appropriate post or get args, to control it the way you like.
