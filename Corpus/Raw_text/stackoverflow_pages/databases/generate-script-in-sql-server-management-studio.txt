 If I have a table with data in a database in SQL Server, how can I generate a script that will create the table and add the data too?  
 If I right click on the table then select  , that generates a script to just create the table without the data. What I need is a script that creates the table and adds the data that is already existing in the table or 2 separate scripts, one that creates the table and one that adds the data. 
 
 Here what you have to do: 
 
 right click the database (not the table) and select tasks --> generate scripts 
 Next --> select the requested table/tables (from select specific database objects) 
 next --> click advanced --> types of data to script = schema and data 
 next and finish 
 
 
 Use SSMS scripting feature (Rightclick on database->Tasks->Generate Scripts) 
 or 
 use  SSMS Tools Pack 
 
 Here You can see step by step process of Generate script in SQL Server Management Studio :

 **Step 3: Select Script Entire Database**

 and Finish 
 Now you can use your script file.
