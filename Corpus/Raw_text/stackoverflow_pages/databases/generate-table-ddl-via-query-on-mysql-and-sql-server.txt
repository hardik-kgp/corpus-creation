*** generate-table-ddl-via-query-on-mysql-and-sql-server ***

 Is there an easy way to extract table DDL information, via a query, using either Ms or My SQL server?  (preferably both?) 
 For example, using MySQL Administrator / Navicat for MySql, there is a "DDL" function, which generates the "create table foo (....)" script. 
 Is there any way to get this information from a query itself, such as: 
 
 Any have the "Create table bar (.....)" returned to me? 
 If not - any suggestions? 
 
 it's mysql-specific, but   gives you the DDL for a table. 
 
 You have to create that yourself. 
 You can query   for the column name and data type. 
 
 You can't get the the   text in a cross platform way, but you can get enough information to build it yourself from the   views.
