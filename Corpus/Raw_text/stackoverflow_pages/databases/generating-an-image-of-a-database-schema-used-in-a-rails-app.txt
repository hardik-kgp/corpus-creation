 How can I go about generating an image of a database schema used in a Rails app? 
 
 Have you tried  ? 
 Essentially, make sure that your   file is referencing the database you wish to dump, and then run the command. It'll take all of the tables and indexes in said database and then write it out to  . 
 Note that you should rename   once it contains the dump; otherwise, it could it overwritten.
