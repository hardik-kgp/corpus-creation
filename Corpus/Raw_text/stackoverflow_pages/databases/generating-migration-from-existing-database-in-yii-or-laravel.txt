*** generating-migration-from-existing-database-in-yii-or-laravel ***

 I'm working on a project that has a fairly complex database (150+ tables). In order to be able to maintain changes, I've decided to add migrations, preferably using Yii or Laravel. 
 Does anybody know, if it is possible to generate a initial migration from an existing database? 
 Creating it by hand would: 
 
 take for ever and 
 be very error-prone. 
 
 If there is no way, does anybody know a good PHP-based framework, that supports such functionality? 
 
 Instructions for accomplishing this in Yii: 
 
 Add your database connection settings to  . 
 Run   to create the stub code for the migration. 
 Copy contents of  this gist  to  . 
 Run   to generate   and   methods for initial database migration. 
 Copy and paste   and   methods from   to the file created in the   folder in step 2. 
 
 
 ' Doctrine Project ' (aka Doctrine) has the ability to create DB migrations for existing DB structures, so you can recreate the existing structure. It can be easily implemented in Symfony, Laravel, also in Yii and many frameworks. 
 Sample from: 
 http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/doctrine/1_2/en/07-Migrations 
 
 **From Database**

 If you have an existing database you can build a set of migration
  classes that will re-create your database by running the following
  command. 
 
 **From Models**

 If you have an existing set of models you can build a set of migration
  classes that will create your database by running the following
  command. 
 
 
 
 Well since migration is about setting up your database structure and make changes to it, not to reflect a current database there is no such way. 
 And this is also not a step you have to make. You can start from where you are at the moment, which will make you able to rollback up to this point. Which means you can make migrations for your current tables without having to specify their entire structure, but just the changes only. 
 Let's say you have a table called user and want to add their firstname to it. 
 
 Now go into   and find the migration file, add this 
 
 Now you can add migrate it 
 
 .. and rollback using 
 
 This will add or drop the column firstname, without affecting your table in any other way. 
 
 Here is a Laravel package I created that does exactly that. It automatically generates clean and accurate Laravel migrations from your existing database. 
 As it doesn't make any assumptions of the database, it should work on any database structure while even keeping the original index and foreign key names.

 As for Yii 1.x,  schmunk  has created a wonderful   yiic command. 
 **This command covers only up migrations. You must write your own down migrations**
. 
 To use it: 
 
 Get  the newest version from GitHub  and put it's contents into   folder (create one, if it does not exist). Note, that you need to put contents  as is  ( **without subfolder**
 for this particular command), which is contrary to what we do for example for extensions. 
 Rename   file (and class inside) to  , if you want to use   command (as suggested in docs). Without this fix, you'll have to use   command, as  there's slight inconsistency between docs and the code  (at least in the newest version, as of writing this; maybe  schmunk  is going to fix this). 
 Having this, navigate back to   folder in your console and execute  . 
 
 This will create a migration   file with proper date and time in the beginning of file name, filled with series of   commands to recreate your database schema. Visit " Usage " section in the docs to read more about customizing command. 
 
 I think that the answer is:  https://github.com/jamband/yii2-schemadump  for Yii2
"This command to generate the schema from an existing database." 
 
 I use both Yii and Laravel and I could not find what you require for either of them. They both create empty files and you need to create the migration script yourself.
For a table of 150 tables it will be challenge to create the migrations yourself, but it is not quite as hard as you imagine. Because you already have the information on the fields it should not take so long to create.  
 
 After doing some research, here's what you're going to need for Laravel:  https://github.com/XCMer/larry-four-generator 
 (version 4 at least, who knows how long this will work, Laravel changes too fast and has too many breaking changes) 
 You'll want to run   and it'll show you the tables...You can also exclude or only process certain tables (look at the readme). 
 Again, super super useful if you like to build your schema in something like MySQL Workbench. I also saw mention of a package that would parse the workbench files...But the link was dead. 
 You may also wish to use this larry package with:  https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators 
 You can then create scaffolding a la CakePHP style. 
 Alternatively, try this package:  https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-migration-generator 
 
 There is one now for Yii: 
 This allows a distributed team to easily update the db locally and then distribute it's updates with thee other developers automatically with the rest of the code via a versioning control system (I used git). It also performs a full initial db dump to xml and to a migration file. 
 project home:
 https://code.google.com/p/yii-automatically-generated-migration-files/ 
 source code:
 https://code.google.com/p/yii-automatically-generated-migration-files/source/checkout 
 I've created it from scratch as I was annoyed with the fact that I had to do this manually in order to distribute it to my team. 
 Hope it helps!
