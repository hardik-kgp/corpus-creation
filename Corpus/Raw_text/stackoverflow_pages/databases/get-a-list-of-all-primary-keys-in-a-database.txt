 sp_pkeys will return a row for each

  primary key for . The
  columns you are likely most interested

 sp_helpconstraint will list all
  constraints for , including

 The following syntax give you all constraints in database in use. 
 
 
 If you want the data type information as well: 
 
 
 If you are doing this from java you can also use the getPrimaryKeys method in the databasemetadata object.  Perhaps other languages have similar ways to do it.
