*** get-data-from-mysql-database-to-use-in-javascript ***

 I have a javascript that dynamically builds an html page.  In the html page there are textarea boxes for the user to type information in.  The information already exists in a database.  I would like to populate the textarea boxes with the database in the mysql database.
I have php code that will connect to the database and build an html table with the data, so I know how to do this with php, but I don't know how to do this from the javascrip. I've studied ajax get requests, etc., but I'm still not sure of how to do this. 
 
 Probably the easiest way to do it is to have a php file return JSON. So let's say you have a file  , 
 
 If you're constrained to using document.write (as you note in the comments below) then give your fields an id attribute like so:  . You can reference that field with this jQuery:  . 
 Here's a complete example with the HTML. If we're assuming your fields are called   and  , then 
 
 That's insertion after the HTML has been constructed, which might be easiest. If you mean to populate data while you're dynamically constructing the HTML, then you'd still want the PHP file to return JSON, you would just add it directly into the   attribute. 
 
 To do with javascript you could do something like this: 
 
 Then you can use whatever you want in your javascript to put the text var into the textbox. 
 
 Do you really need to "build" it from javascript or can you simply return the built HTML from PHP and insert it into the DOM? 
 
 Send AJAX request to php script 
 PHP script processes request and builds table 
 PHP script sends response back to JS in form of encoded HTML 
 JS takes response and inserts it into the DOM 
 
 
 You  can't  do it with only Javascript. You'll need some server-side code (PHP, in your case) that serves as a proxy between the DB and the client-side code.
