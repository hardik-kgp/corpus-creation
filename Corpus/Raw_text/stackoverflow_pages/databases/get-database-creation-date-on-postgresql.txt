*** get-database-creation-date-on-postgresql ***

 I want to get the Database creation date in POSTGRESQL.
My version is 9.3.4 running on Ubuntu 14.04.
Can I do it with a   statement or can I do it with access to the server? 
 
 There is no built-in record of the PostgreSQL database creation time in the system. All approaches that rely on file system creation/modification times can produce wrong answers. 
 For example, if you   a replica node then fail over to it, the creation time will appear to be the time the replica was created.   doesn't preserve file creation/modification times because they're generally not considered relevant for operation of the database system. 
 The only reliable way to get the database creation time is to create a 1-row table with the creation time in it when you create the database, then set permissions / add a trigger so it rejects updates. 
 If you don't mind the risk of a wrong answer where the creation time is reported as being much newer than it really was, you can look at the timestamp of the   file. @Bob  showed a useful way to do that . 
 
 I completely agree with Craig Ringer (excellent answer!)... but for my purposes , this is good enough:  
 
 Simple and clean (but superuser).
