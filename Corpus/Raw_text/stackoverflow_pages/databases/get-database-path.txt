*** get-database-path ***

 Im new to android and I want to create kind of CRUD with SQLite. 
 I have a   which have a constructor: 
 
 and a getter for datebase: 
 
 If I start a program for the first time - everything seems to be okay. database is null and I create it (with a table). But when I restart my app database is null again and table cannot be created. 
 I've decided to write a checkDB function, which tries to open a database. But where can I get a path for it? I dont want it to be "hardcoded". 
 Or may be I'm doing some kind of anti-pattern? 
 
 You can get path by  
 
 You can use getDatabasePath method inside your helper's constructor:  
 
 
 To get the path of Sqlite data base 
 here  I am writing two ways to get the path. 
 **(1) using custom method**

 
 **(2) using File class**

 
 even you will see the both code ...then both code is same,
1st one is the shortcut method to get the database path, and it's occupy the  less memory  compare to second option. 
 
 I needed to access dbs for the app also.  This worked for me:  
 
 Hope it helps! :-)
