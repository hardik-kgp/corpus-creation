*** get-database-schema-with-one-query ***

 Basically I want to get the table names, and the field names for each table from the current database that is connected, nothing else. 
 Is this possible? 
 I know that   gets you the table names, and   will get you the fields, but that's at least [1 x # of tables] queries and I get more information that I want :) 
 
 The  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS  table has what you're asking for. 
 
 
 
 
 
 works for SQLSERVER 2005.  The column names might be different for MySQL (I assume that's what you're using), but the concept is the same. 
 
 "Show databases", "Show tables" and "describe table" are the best, fastest way I know of in MySql. 
 But they  are  MySql-specific. 
 If you want: 
 a) a portable way to query your database schema 
 
 b) more granular control over your query, then look at INFORMATION_SCHEMA:

 After a few trials, i made this sql code to see the columns in my table.
