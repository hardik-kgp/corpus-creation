*** get-last-deleted-id-in-mysql ***

 Similar to  , is there a nice mechanism in MySQL to get the last deleted ID after a row has been deleted? 
 
 By "ID", I assume you mean "auto-increment"? 
 Since you can delete any arbitrary row (or set of rows) at any time: no, there's no way to tell WHICH row (or rows) you most recently deleted. 
 You  can , however, create a "trigger" to save this information for you: 
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/triggers.html 
 
 Instead of creating a trigger, you need to use this each and every time when you delete  
 
 
 It depends on how you make deletions. But if you have an integer id column, you can use the following hack: 
 
 But you should make sure that MySQL short-circuits the former condition and does not optimize to run   first. That is you can adjust the query to something like: 
 
 P.S. I do not ask why you might need this. Most probably, you should not want it =) 
 
 If you happen to be calling your MySQL database from JDBC, then you can execute a   and call   as you read through the results and grab the id's.

 The hack with last_insert_id was already mentioned, but that answer 
misses the fact that it could aggregate! 
 last insert id has fixed size but for small keys it could be used.
