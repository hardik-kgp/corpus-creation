 Is there any way to simplify this code for fetching the index of a certain row, with a column provided? In this case, index will be  , since I'm iterating through the first column until i find "A". Feels like there should be a linq solution to this, but I can't figure it out.

 Hope this helps.  
 
 Use linq operation, but for that your target framework should be 4.5.
Import system.Data.DataExtensions and apply the linq query will help you out.
