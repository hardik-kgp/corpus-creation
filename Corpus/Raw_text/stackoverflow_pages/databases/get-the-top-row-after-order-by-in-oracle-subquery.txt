*** get-the-top-row-after-order-by-in-oracle-subquery ***

 I have a table student(id, name, department, age, score). I want to find the youngest student who has the highest(among the youngest students) score of each department. In SQL Server, I can use following SQL. 
 
 However, in Oracle, you cannot use the order by clause in subquery and there is no limit/top like keyword. I have to join the student table with itself two times to query the result. In oracle, I use following SQL. 
 
 Does anyone have any idea to simplify the above SQL for oracle.

 In addition to Allan's answer, this works fine too: 
 
 
 In addition to Bharat's answer, it is possible to do this using ORDER BY in the sub-query in Oracle (as point out by Jeffrey Kemp): 
 
 If you use this method, you may be tempted to remove the sub-query and just use  . This would result in the incorrect result as the sort would be applied after the criteria (you'd get 1 row that was sorted, not one row from the sorted set).
