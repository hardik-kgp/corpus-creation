*** getting-a-working-spatialite-sqlite-system-for-x64-c-sharp ***

 I need to create and access a spatialite-extended SQLite database under x64 windows. 
 I have downloaded the latest version 1.0.92.0 called    of  System.Data.SQLite . It is referenced from my Visual Studio (2012) project, and seems to work just fine by itself. 
 I also have the latest precompiled x64  spatiaLite  version 4.1.1 called spatialite-4.1.1-DLL-win-amd64.zip 
All the dlls from spatialite are present in the executing directory. 
 When I try to load the extension: 
 
 I get an  **AccessViolationException**
 (Attempted to read protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt) on the   line. 
 I notice when looked at with  PE Deconstructor  (software that determines the bitnewss of dll/exe), it says that my copy of System.Data.SQLite.dll (from the x64 package) is actually 32bits. Is that the problem? 
 How to I remedy this? 
 How has anyone else got spatiaLite working on x64? 
 
 Actually, the problem could be in  spatialite-4.dll  this autmun I spent a week trying to fix the same issue without success. It looks like that there problems in spatialite-4.dll (I mean this one downloaded form gaia-sins (official spatialite site) )
You can try to build a Spatialite from sources (like a nightmare (: ) or try to look for another build of .dll. Second option helped me.
Btw, there a couple of .dlls you need to use Spatialite extension: 
 
 libsqlite3-0.dll 
 libgeos-3-0-2.dll 
 libgeos-c-1.dll 
 libiconv2.dll 
 libproj-0.dll 
 libvirtualtext-2.dll 
 libspatialite-2.dll 
<----- Spatialite v.2 completely suits my project. As I told, if you need v.4 you can try to build it or look for a another build.
Hope, this helps 
 
 
 download mod_spatialite from the  site , choose mod_spatialite-4.2.0-win-amd64.7z. unzip and copy all dll to the bin folder of your program.

 I just found out, that the hack described at
   http://blog.jrg.com.br/2016/04/25/Fixing-spatialite-loading-problem/ 
  only works with the dlls from the second most recent version of
  mingw64  mingw-w64-bin_x86_64-linux_20131228.tar.bz2 from
   http://netassist.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw-w64/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/mingw-w64-bin_x86_64-linux_20131228.tar.bz2 .  
  Any attempt to do the same with the most recent version available at
  sourcefourge
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download 
  failed on my system. 
 However, I can definitely confirm, that I can load mod_spatialite with
