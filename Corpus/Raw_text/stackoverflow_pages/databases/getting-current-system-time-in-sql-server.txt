*** getting-current-system-time-in-sql-server ***

 How do I get current system time in SQL Server? 
 
 Use the  GETDATE()  function 
 
 
 CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  is ANSI compliant and equivalent to GETDATE() 
 Otherwise, you have a  plethora of functions  as mentioned in SQL Server 2008 BOL here (with link for SQL Server 2005 too). 
 I think marc_s might have missed 1 or 2 ;-) 
 
 Since SQL Server 2000, we also had: 
 
  to get the UTC (Universal Time) - no dependant on local time zone settings 
 
 SQL Server 2008 (the OP didn't specify his exact version) also has: 
 
  to get the current local time including the timezone offset as DATETIMEOFFSET data type (new to SQL Server 2008) 
 
 SQL Server 2008 also offers   and   with more accuracy (down to 100ns) than   or   in previous versions (accuracy: 3.33ms). 
 
 dater datetime default getupdate()
dater it is an name of column

 but the inserting a column data we firstly mention the column names
i.e. insert into table_name(column names) values(that mention in column names);
