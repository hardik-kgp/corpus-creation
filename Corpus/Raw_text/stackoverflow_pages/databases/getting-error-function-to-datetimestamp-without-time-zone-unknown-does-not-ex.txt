*** getting-error-function-to-datetimestamp-without-time-zone-unknown-does-not-ex ***

 Recently i have migrated my postgres from 8.2 to 8.4. when I run my application and tried to
login i am getting these error 
 
 i had checked in my postgres by excecuting these to_date function 
 
 it is giving me error  function to_date does not exist 
 when i execute the same query in postgres 8.2 i am not getting error 
 Please help me to resolve these issue. 
 
 It seems like all it needs is a conversion from timestamp to text as function definition is: to_date(text,text). 
 Perhaps in 8.2 this conversion from timestamp to text was already predefined.
