*** getting-number-of-fields-in-a-database-with-an-sql-statement ***

 How would I get the number of fields/entries in a database using an SQL Statement? 
 
 mmm all the fields in all the tables? assuming standards (mssql, mysql, postgres) you can issue a query over information_schema.columns 
 
 Or grouped by table: 
 
 If multiple schemas has the same table name in the same DB, you MUST include schema name as well (i.e: dbo.Books, user.Books, company.Books etc.) Otherwise you'll get the wrong results. So the best practice is:  
 
 
 try this, this will exclude views, leave the where clause out if you want views 
 
 
 Sounds like this is what you need. 
 
 
 Just for any other readers who are googling... 
 There are several non-SQL solutions, that may be useful to the user..
here's 2 that I use. 
 Example 1:
Access VBA: 
 
 Example 2:
PHP 5.1:
