*** getting-started-setup-database-for-node-js ***

 I am new to node.js but am excited to try it out. I am using  Express  as a web framework, and  Jade  as a template engine. Both were easy to get setup following  this tutorial  from  Node Camp . 
 However the one problem I am finding is  **I can't find a simple tutorial for getting a DB set up**
. I am trying to build a basic chat application (store session and message). 
 **Does anyone know of a good tutorial?**
  
 This other  SO post  talks about dbs to use- but as this is very different from the Django/MySQL world I've been in, I want to make sure I understand what is going on. 
 Thanks! 
 
 **I assume you have **
**npm**
** installed the correct way using one of these **
**snippets**
**(I used the top one).**

 **Redis**

 I would use redis as a database. For one it is really  fast , persistent. You need to install it, but that is really easy. 
 
 **Redis-cli**

 Next you should play with redis yourself. I would advice you to look at this excellent tutorial by  Simon Willison . He and I also advice you to just play with the   to get a feeling of the database. 
 **Redis client**

 Finally you need to install a redis client. I would advise you to use mranney's  node_redis  because I think it is the fastest and most actively developed client. 
 **Installation**

 
 **Simple example, included as example.js:**

 
 **Storing sessions in database**

 Also the author of express has created a library to handle your  sessions  using redis. 
 **Installation:**

 
 **Example:**

 
 **Storing messages in database**

 I think I would use a  sorted set  for this. Store the messages using   and retrieve them using  ,  . 
 **Socket.io**

 Finally if you are trying to create a simple chat I would advise you to have a look at socket.io. 
 
 socket.io aims to make realtime apps
  possible in every browser and mobile
  device, blurring the differences
  between the different transport
  mechanisms. 
 
 I also created a chat using socket.io which I posted on  stackoverflow . Adding persistence + authentication should be a breeze. 
 
 Express authentication using Redis for session store and Couchdb for database using coffeescript..

 I use this template for most of my projects. You can implement a similar mongodb version of it too using: 
 node-mongodb-native by christkv :  https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native , or 
 mongoose :  https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose , or  
 amark's mongous:  https://github.com/amark/mongous 
 
 In addition to the NodeCamp tutorial you mention there is another NodeCamp  tutorial  given by Matt Ranney the aforementioned author of the redis node library. It goes into a wee bit more depth. 
 
 I know this is an old post, but in case anyone else stumbles upon it, I created a tutorial using most of the OP's components, especially the connection to the database. It does have some added complexity with the use of Backbone.js, but it is all in good fun!
