 Is it possible to generate a XML Schema of a Database programatically with .Net and C#? I want to look into NDbUnit but for big databases it would not really be feasible to make a Schema manually?  
 
 
 Is it possible to generate a XML
  Schema from a Database? 
 
 It sure is,  XMLSpy  can generate XML Schema from a database. 
 There's  another way , though I've never tested it: 
 
 
 I could do it like this: 
 
 Problem is, how could I adapt this method so that it could be used with a indeterminate amount of tables? Without building up a string though concatenation which is not exactly ideal!  
 
 Use MyGeneration's typed-dataset-template to auto-generate the XSD ( http://www.mygenrationssoftware.com ).  Its free, OSS, and works great.  Also, the NDbUnit team is presently working on an add-on tool to NDbUnit that will make it possible to not only extract the schema from the database, but also to edit the test data that is contained within the accompanying XML dataset.  ETA for this tool is about mid-July.
