*** git-backed-orm-for-python ***

 While looking for information about versioned databases, I came across the  gitmodel  project for Ruby, which is a versioned ORM on top of git. 
 There are a few projects I'm involved in that could benefit from some sort of versioned data store, and Git seems like a natural solution in this space.  Our team is already familiar both with the git command line tools and the use of programmatic interfaces to git, such as  dulwich , so something like  gitmodel  would play to our existing experience. 
 Is there anything similar available for Python?  
 
 Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams pointed me towards the 
 django-versions  package, which while not based on git  does  offer a good model for storing versioned data.  I haven't had the opportunity to work with Django before, but this look as if it may be the best available option right now. 
 According to the documentation this may not work with the latest version of Django (the documentation says it requires 1.1.x, while Django is up to 1.4 for realz and 1.3 in my distribution's package repository).  I guess I'll look at it as a learning experience and see how much work is required to integrate it with more recent Django releases... 
 
 Fresh from the oven, but you can take a look at  python-git-orm .
