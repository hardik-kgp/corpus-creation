*** good-articles-describing-the-infastructure-of-large-commercial-sites-like-amazon ***

 Can anyone point me to a good primer on how a large scale commercial website like amazon.com is set up? Most importantly, I'd like to know about how the databases are set up. Do they have a distributed set of databases to balance the load, that all sends updates to one 'master' database, etc.? Doesn't have to be the inside dope(although that's preferable), just a plausible account of how smart people would run an amazon.com. 
 
 The guys at  software engineering radio  have done an  interview podcast with Werner Vogels , who is the CTO of amazon.com. 
 Quite interresting and a lot of detail.

 Besides this website contains architectural information about other high volume websites. 
 Also have a look at this video
