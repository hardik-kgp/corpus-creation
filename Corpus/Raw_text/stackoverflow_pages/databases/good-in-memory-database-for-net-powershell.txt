*** good-in-memory-database-for-net-powershell ***

 If I have a script that handles state information that's a bit more complex that can be stored in variables, what's the best option for a small in-memory database? 
 Sqlite is an option, though that would be an external dependency. XML might do, though it's non-relational. 
 Is there any consensus on a tool for this job?  
 
 Considering PowerShell's great support for scripting .NET, how about using an  ADO.NET   DataSet . 
 
 For small data ( less then few GBs ) you can use a  RAM disk , and use any usual storage ( SQ DB, NoSQL DB, or even a text file), to store data, as usual. 
 
 If you need to persist the data across session, consider using  SQL Server Compact Edition . I have used it for a number of smallish .NET projects and it generally works like a small, single user SQL Server.
