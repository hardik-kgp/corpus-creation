 I'm looking for a book/site/tutorial on best practices for relational database design, tuning for performance etc. It turns out this kind of resource is a bit difficult to find; there's a lot of "here's normalization, here's ER diagrams, have at it," but not much in the way of real examples. Anyone have any ideas? 
 
 Book:  Database Design for Mere Mortals 
 
 Take a look at the  Library of Free Data Models . There are tons of example database designs, with diagrams that cover real-world scenarios (and some just fun/funny ones as well). I haven't ever used one as-is, but it's often been handy to get an idea of how to approach the problem of mapping the needs of the situation into a data model. 
 
 Check out the " The Art of SQL ". A pleasure to read. 
 
 Here are some resources I could find on the web. They include examples you are looking for:
