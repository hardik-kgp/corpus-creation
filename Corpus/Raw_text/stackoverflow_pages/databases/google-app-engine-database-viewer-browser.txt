*** google-app-engine-database-viewer-browser ***

 Does Google App Engine offer any kind of database browser/viewer tool which can show  **CURRENT**
 data? 1-day late database view was offered, however, it's not enough. 
 
 appengine.google.com has its own datastore viewer. where you can login and view the complete datastore for all your applications. In the development server, appengine SDK emulates the same. You can access it like  http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin 
 
 Datastore on the appengine is accessible at, 
 https://console.developers.google.com/datastore/entities/query?project=yourappid 
(replace yourappid appropriately) 
 This will be the current data.  
 
 I think that datastore viewer in development server can be accessed through  http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin  instead.  
 
 If you're using GoogleAppEngineLauncher, you can see Admin Port and the Port. Go to the Admin Port to access the datastore.
