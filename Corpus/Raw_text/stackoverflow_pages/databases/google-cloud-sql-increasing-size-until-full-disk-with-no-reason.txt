*** google-cloud-sql-increasing-size-until-full-disk-with-no-reason ***

 I don't know how to explain this well, but I will try. 
 
 I use Google Cloud SQL second edition with 20 GB disk size. 
 I have several wp. databases with 166.5 MB Total size. 
 
 And right now my Storage usage is 9.52 GB! (With 166.5 MB SQL data...) and increasing still going faster...
What to do?! 
 
 
 **UPDATE :**
  
 I solve this with :  
 
 I made an export in bucket 
 I created a new instance Cloud SQL  
 Import from bucket 
 And delete instance with problem. 
 
 (And changed ip from my applications) 
 I don't know sure where problem come from but could be a "Storage overhead from binary logs".
Next time will check binnary logs with : mysql> SHOW BINARY LOGS; 
 What I think Google is missing is a  **purge binary logs**
! (an easy way!) 
 **UPDATE FINAL :**
  
 With binary logs active, stoarge of your cloud sql will expand continuously.
For anyone in the same situation, you can edit the instance and uncheck binary logs, after that the current binary logs will purge. 
 Sorry for my noob problem! :D (I'm a beginner in Server administration.) 
 Thanks  **Vadim**

 If you have binary logs enabled, mysql will make a record of all changes, which is required for replication or point-in-time recovery.  
 If you have no need for these features, you can disable binary logs which will purge any existing logs from your instance. 
 If binary logs are enabled, they will not grow indefinitely. Binary logs older than the oldest automatic backup (7 days) are purged automatically.
