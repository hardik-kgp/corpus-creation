*** graph-database-in-java-other-than-neo4j ***

 Greetings, 
 **Is there any open source graph database available other than Neo4J??**
  
 **NOTE:**
  Why not Neo4J? 
Neo4J is opensource, but counts primitives (number of nodes,relationships & properties). If you are using it for commercial use. And does not have any straight forward information of pricing on official website. so there can be potential vendor lock-in (Although I have just started my company, and don't have budget to spent money on software anyway.) so It is out of option. 
 Regards, 
 
 As RobV said, if your graphs can be represented in just about any custom format such as  RDF  or  DOT language , you're in luck! Here's various options you have: 
 
 RDF:  Jena  - Considered to be the de facto implementation of RDF for Java, however it has it's oddities such as heavy usage of Iterators. 
 RDF:  Protégé  - If you don't use Jena (and even if you would) but would like to use RDF, Protégé is the tool for you. It's basically a really well done ontology editor which makes handling the graph data a breeze. It also uses a plugin hierarchy similar to Eclipse and there's loads of plugins available so you can plugin stuff like  OWL ontologies  easily. 
 DOT:  GraphViz  - Another very popular tool, GraphViz can generate graphs from DOT language. Very powerful, a bit tricky to learn but also potentially all you need. 
 
 Of course if it fits your company's profile, you could develop your own and start selling it as a product. 
 
 OrientDB  ( old link ) appears to support graph storage in much the same was as Neo4j 
 
 Wikipedia lists some other alternatives:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database 
 
 I suggest you to use  Blueprints  from tinkerpop, they allow you to use a graphDB of your choice (also from Neo4j and OrientDB). And they also provide an extension to use the db as rdf repository (using Sesame Sail). 
 
 Well,
Neo4j is Open Source under the GPLv3 for the Community Edition and AGPL for the Advanced and Enterprise editions. 
 For more info, please look at  http://neo4j.org/licensing-guide/

 If your Graphs could be represented as RDF graphs then you could use Jena since that is entirely free and open source 
 http://jena.sourceforge.net 
 Whether that's in any way useful to you depends on why you need a Graph database and what type of Graphs you need to store in it. 
 
 Also take a look at ArrangoDB. A lovely multi-model database.

 EDIT : Must say that I'm falling more and more in love with Arrango :) 
 
 I know, it's been a while, but, today, I was asking myself the same question, and I found  OhmDB 
Seems to be for lightweight purposes.
