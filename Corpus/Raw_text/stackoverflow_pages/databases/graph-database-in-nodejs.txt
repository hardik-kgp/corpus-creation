*** graph-database-in-nodejs ***

 A bit of an abstract question...  
 I'm looking at graph databases in nodejs. 
 Of all the options I've been able to find: Neo4J, Infinite Graph, Sones, InfoGrid, etc, none seem to have node APIs, so will have to be accessed through some flavor of HTTP. Does anyone have any experience working with any of these? What would be the best choice?  
 Thanks.  
 
 Yes,
you might look at  https://github.com/thingdom/node-neo4j  (example at  http://gensen.herokuapp.com/show/34 ) and  https://github.com/neo4j/neo4js  for some nice bindings, example at  https://github.com/tbaum/heroku-node-neo4js 
 HTH 
 
 Don't scare off! Node.js is very good at using HTTP and parsing JSON. You don't really need an abstraction over those "low-level" actions. You can actually write your own abstraction package easily and publish it :) 
 Neo4J REST API  is what you want to use with node. I've heard only positive from my colleague about Neo4j. 
 I personally have been using CouchDB ( not a graph-db, but still a NoSQL db ) http api with node.js, and it works like a charm. 
 
 If you're fancy of keep things simple, try  levelgraph . It's a graph db that wraps around LevelDB - a key/value data store
