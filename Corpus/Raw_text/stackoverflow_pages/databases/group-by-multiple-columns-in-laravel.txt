 How to   multiple column in Laravel?
I tried this code: 
 
 But this is not working. 
 
 Did you try: 
 
 Can't test here right now, but the API says groupBy() accepts an array.  
 For reference, please visit: 
 
 Laravel 5.0:  https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.0/src/Illuminate/Database/Query/Builder.php#L1037 
 Laravel 4.2:  https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Database/Query/Builder.php#L1017 
 
 
 It is incorrect to believe that the Database\Query\Builder::groupBy() method accepts arrays as arguments. Currently, it will only accept N number of string arguments. 
 As of this writing, the current version of the Laravel Framework is: v4.2.4, and the code for the Database\Query\Builder::groupBy() method is as follows: 
 
 If you think about it, func_get_args() returns an array of all columns that might have been fed in as strings. Therefore, expected input of this function is: 
 
 The resulting $this->groups property on the builder object should be an array of strings, like this: 
 
 However, if we fed an array into the method above, like this: 
 
 the $this->groups property would end up with a nested array that looks like this: 
 
 The rest of the query builder framework expects the $builder->groups property to be a non-nested array of strings. Thus, when the framework tries to columnize and wrap table names in their proper escaped format (each database engine has a different table name escape operator), it tries to wrap an array instead of a string and you get your error. 
 The offending error line is line 49 in Database\Grammar::wrap(). 
 If we were to modify the Database\Query\Builder::groupBy() method to make it accept arrays, we would rewrite it something like the following: 
 
 This method accepts an array at any parameter index. 
 
 Edit your applications's database config file  
 In mysql array, set   to disable MySQL's strict mode to make this work.
