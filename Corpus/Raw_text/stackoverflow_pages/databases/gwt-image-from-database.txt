*** gwt-image-from-database ***

 I'm actually working on a GWT based website.
Now I'm stuck on how I should display images stored in a database on my website. 
 Basically I've a bytearray in my database, which I fetch using hibernate.
Now should I probably create an ... tag out of that data, but I don't know how 
 I'm using GWT in Java and Hibernate 
 
 Here is the solution. First you should encode the byte array by using com.google.gwt.user.server.Base64Utils.toBase64(byte[]) . But this method does not work for IE 7. and IE8 has 32kb limit.. IE9 does not have this limit.  
 here is the method on the server 
 
 Here is the client method ; 
 
 
 I don't know how GWT works, albeit you can map a servlet/controller which returns resourceStream.
For example if you map a servlet "imageViewer" which takes imageId param, request to image would become   
 
 Hibernate object would have reference to the blob, so you can return that.
Reference on UI would be   
 
 Update: You may not be able to use Model as it is to return image, you would need an explicit controller or servlet which returns stream data. 
In servlet you would do something like 
 
 
 There is  Image Widget  in GWT. You can't do it client-side but you can call  RPC  to communicate with the server. Then it is simple CRUD application. In server connect to database with hibernate and return the Image to the client or it's url and on the client-side do something like that : 
 
 That's all. Happy coding 
 
 I used the same approach as Gursel Koca suggested but could only get it to work using the Apache Base64 library, not (ironically) the GWT Base64Utils 
 
 Also note that if you are updating an existing image or an image placeholder, the setURL method will overwrite your stylesheet, so make sure to grab that first:
