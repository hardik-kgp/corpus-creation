*** h2-and-query-logging ***

 Is there a way to get a "query log" out of H2, like you can with e.g. MySQL? The closest match so far is the TRACE_LEVEL_FILE option, but it it not good for debugging the individual queries, especially when they have variable parameters like most do. 
 
 The   is the best option. There are 4 levels: 
 
 0 (disabled) 
 1 (only errors) 
 2 (errors and info messages, including SQL statements) 
 3 (debug level; including SQL statements and parameter values) 
 4 (log using SLF4J) 
 
 So I guess 2 would be the right level in your case. 
 There is also a simple way to analyze the trace file, documented in  Database Profiling .
