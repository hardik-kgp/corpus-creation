*** h2-db-chunk-no-longer-exists-error ***

 When I'm trying to add a new row to db "INSERT INTO invited_users VALUES('id', user_name')" 
 I'm getting this error: 
 
 Probably it's some problems with db, because when I tried to add the same row to a new db - error disappeared.

 Good news! I contacted developers of H2 db and find out that they will fix that bug in the next release.

 A simple workaround is to disable the MVStore by appending ";mv_store=false" to the database URL. 
 **But**
, this trick will not work, if you need the old db. It creates new database, with .h2.db extension instead of .mv.db 
 **To overcome this**
 you need to create SQL script of your old database ".mv.db" (with Recover tool), and then run this script using "runscript ...". 
 
 In version 1.4.182, there is probably something  wrong with the mechanism that detects when a chunk is no longer referenced. Currently, this is   garbage collection: by counting live
pages and live space. If this reaches zero, a chunk can be overwritten after 45 seconds. 
 A simple workaround is to use the   storage mechanism instead of   by changing the database connection to use   as a mitigation. 
 MV_STORE option is automatically enabled since version  1.4.177 Beta . 
 
 By default, the MV_STORE option is enabled, so it is using the new
  MVStore storage. The MVCC setting is by default set to the same values
  as the MV_STORE setting, so it is also enabled by default. For
  testing, both settings can be disabled by appending ";MV_STORE=FALSE"
  and/or ";MVCC=FALSE" to the database URL.
