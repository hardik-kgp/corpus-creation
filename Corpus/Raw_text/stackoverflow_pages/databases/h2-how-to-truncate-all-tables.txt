*** h2-how-to-truncate-all-tables ***

 I assume there is a way of doing this from code, at least some good workaround. 
 Please consider that I do not want to delete all tables (I've seen this command), just to delete rows from them but to keep existing schema and all constraints. 
 Maybe I can somehow obtain the list of all tables from metadata and apply TRUNCATE command for each separately? But what about their relations and foreign keys? 
 Any Idea?  
 
 You may do it this way: 
 
 Disable referential integrity using  
 Get the list of all tables using  
 Delete the data from each table using  
 Enable referential integrity using  
 
 
 For now, I came up with this solution... But still need to test it more thoroughly. 
 
 
 Here is an example of  stored procedure    that disables foreign keys, then truncates all tables in current schema and then enables foreign keys back: 
 
 Or you can define the function in your code: 
 
 and then use as alias: 
 
 Here I added   statements as an example if you are using H2 in MySQL mode you have to switch back to H2 mode, then declare the function and then switch back to MySQL mode. 
 Unfortunately the   doesn't resets auto_inc columns. See  Spring test with H2 in memory database truncate all tables  for details.
