*** h2-in-memory-tables-remote-connection ***

 I am having problems with creating an in memory table, using H2 database, and accessing it outside of the JVM it is created and running in. 
 The documentation structures the url as  
 I've tried many combinations, but simply cannot get the remote connection to work. Is this feature working, can anyone give me the details of how they used this. 
 
 You might look at  In-Memory Databases . For a network connection, you need a host and database name. It looks like you want   or  
 
 None of the solutions mentioned so far worked for me. Remote part just couldn't connect. 
 According to H2's  official documentation : 
 
 To access an in-memory database from another process or from another computer,  **you need to start a TCP server in the same process as the in-memory database was created**
. The other processes then need to access the database over TCP/IP or TLS, using a database URL such as: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/mem:db1. 
 
 I marked the crucial part of the text in bold. 
 And I found a working solution at this guy's  blog : 
 
 The first process is going to create the DB, with the following URL: 
 
 and itâ€™s going to need to start a tcp Server: 
 
 The other processes can then access your DB by using the following URL: 
 
 
 And that is it! Worked like a charm! 
 
 Having just faced this problem I found I needed to append   to the JDBC URL for the  tcp connection .  So my URLs were: 
 
 In Memory :  
 TCP Connection :  
 
 From the h2 docs : 
 
 By default, closing the last connection to a database closes the
  database. For an in-memory database, this means the content is lost.
  To keep the database open, add   to the database
  URL. 
 
 Not including   means that I cannot connect to the correct database via TCP.  The connection is made, but it uses a different version to the one created in-memory (validated by using the   parameter)
