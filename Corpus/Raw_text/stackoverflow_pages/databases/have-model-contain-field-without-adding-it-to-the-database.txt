 In my Asp.NET MVC4 application I want to add a field to my model without adding it to the database. 
 Sort of a field that only lives in c# instances of the model but not in the database itself. 
 Is there any annotation or other way to exclude the field from the database itself? 
 I mean an object I can read and write in runtime which the database has no knowledge of. 
 
 Just decorate your field/property with  . 
 For example: 
 
 See  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.schema.notmappedattribute.aspx 
 
 That depends what framework you are using to access your data. I assume it's Entity Framework. Well, you can create partial class with the property that you wanty to not be mapped to your database.  
 something like 
 
 but that is not advised.
