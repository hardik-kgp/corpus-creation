*** hbase-error-assignment-of-root-failure ***

 I've just installed hadoop and hbase from cloudera (3) but when I try to go to  http://localhost:60010  it just sits there continually loading. 
 I can get to the regionserver fine -  http://localhost:60030 ... Looking at the master hbase server logs I can see the following.  
 Looks like a problem with the root region.  
 All of this is installed on a ext4 1TB partition running Ubuntu (Natty) 11. No cluster/other boxes). 
 Any help would be great! 
 
 
 Fixed this issue for anyone else who finds this. Was a problem with the host file (/etc/hosts). Need to remove entries relating to 127.0.1.1 COMPNAME - just put a hash (#) in front of this line and then restart all hadoop and hbase services.

 As per @Manav: 
 
 If you find yourself in a situation wherein you can't edit /etc/hosts, the following  > workaround will also work: 
 in conf/hadoop-env.sh add the following line: 
 
 
 I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric) and HBase 0.92.1. These steps fixed my issue for my single server install: 
 
 Edit the  : change the IP address associated with the hostname so that it uses your LAN IP instead of  
 Open  
 edit  , append  . The line should look like this: 
 export HBASE_OPTS="-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true" 
 Restart HBase

 your hosts file should look like this 
 
 This file can be found in /etc/hosts

 The trick with a subinterface worked for me, but i used the loopback interface rather than eth0 because eth0 is not always available on my machine (external adapter) and i want it managed by NetworkManager (which refuses to manage eth0 if eth0.1 is defined in /etc/network/interfaces on ubuntu 13.04) 
 Relevant snippet: 
 
 in addition to the regular  
 
 of course 
 
 Here's another work-around that Works For Me, if you're unwilling to alter   (since Ubuntu put that  entry there   for a reason ). 
 As  this post  explains, the core problem is that the loopback interface has multiple IPs bound to it while hbase assumes there will be only one.  The resulting mismatch causes the master to think a region server has one IP (127.0.0.1), when it's really listening on another (127.0.1.1, the IP bound to the host's declared FQDN.) 
 Removing the   entry is one way to restore the one-interface-one-IP assumption.  Replacing   in   with a "real" permanent IP is another.  Finally, another is to create a new interface: drop this in the bottom of  : 
 
 You should then be able to   and see it in  .  Restart hbase & you should be good to go. 
 If you happen to already be using   the pick another slot (i.e.  ), it shouldn't matter. 
 **EDIT**
:  @bcolyn 's use of   also works for me, and is superior since loopback will always be available.  In that case the   line also appears unnecessary. 
 
 In your hosts file to change host address from  **127.0.1.1**
 to  **127.0.0.1**
