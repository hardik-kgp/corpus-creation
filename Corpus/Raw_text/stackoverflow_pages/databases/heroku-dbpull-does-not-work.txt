*** heroku-dbpull-does-not-work ***

 I get the following error message: 
 
 The command above does not produce any messages in the log that can be viewed using 'heroku logs'. 
 Any idea what I am doing wrong? 
 
 Use pgbackups instead of taps/db:pull

 I answered to similar problem here: 
 Unable to fetch tables information when running heroku db:pull 
 I found some kind of work-around. 
I have the same problem with my SHARED_DATABASE on heroku  
ruby 1.9.2  
gems: 
pg (0.11.0) 
heroku (2.32.4) 
heroku-api (0.3.5) 
taps (0.3.24) 
heroku db:pull ended with: 

Unable to fetch tables information from  http://...@taps19.heroku.com . Please check the server log.
 
 I switched to ruby 1.8.7 using rvm and heroku db:pull works fine. 
Back again to ruby 1.9.2 to develop my application. 
 I hope this help someone until db:pull will be fixed with ruby 1.9.2. 
 
 Was able to get it going by reverting back to ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.1.0. 
 Here are some instructions on how to do that with rvm:
