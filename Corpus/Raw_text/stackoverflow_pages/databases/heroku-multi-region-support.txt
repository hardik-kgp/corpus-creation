*** heroku-multi-region-support ***

 Does Heroku offer multi region support for it's implementation?  I'm specifically interested in a master-master database setup in multiple AWS regions. 
 Thanks 
 
 I am looking at the same answer, 4 years later. Here is what I found:  
 
 The only regions Heroku offer is EU / US for the common runtime.  
 If you are a Heroku Enterprise client and use Private Spaces, you have access to the following regions: Dublin, Frankfurt, Oregon, Sydney, Tokyo and Virginia.  source 
 
 By default, Heroku does NOT provide any multi-AZ support, unless you take the Premium options on PG. From what I see, you cannot choose which region you want the replication to be in.  source 
 Lastly, if you want to setup yourself a multi-az architecture (on PG or any other component), you will have to do it yourself.
