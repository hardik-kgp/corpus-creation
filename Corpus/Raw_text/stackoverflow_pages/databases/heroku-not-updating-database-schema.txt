*** heroku-not-updating-database-schema ***

 Heroku doesn't seem to update my database schema when I deploy. Here are the details: 
 Here is what is should look like for the User class: 
 
 end 
 Here is my deploy procedure: 
 
 Everything seems to go smoothly... except that if I check the actually User table in db... 
 
 ... I get an old version of User... 
 
 Any idea what I am doing wrong?
Thanks a lot for your help!

 Do you see any output when you  ? 
 Try running   after you migrate to restart the web servers and DJ workers. That shouldn't influence your console, but I have seen web servers serving old versions of the code immediately after a deploy, which normally isn't a problem but with pending migrations can be. 
 
 You might want to try 
 
 heroku run rake db:migrate  
  heroku restart  
 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 The accepted answer is right. FYI though, you now use   because   is deprecated   
 
 Run  
Then  
 Refresh your web page and it should all work.
