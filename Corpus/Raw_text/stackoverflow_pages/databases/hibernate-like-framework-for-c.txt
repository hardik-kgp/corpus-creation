 I am looking for database-caching framework for C++ providing the following: 
 
 Generate object/table representations via some pseudo-language (macros/templates) 
 Retrieve objects from DB by key when needed 
 LRU caching 
 Immediate and delayed update of DB on object update (via getter/setter methods) 
 
 
 Try  LiteSQL  and  Hiberlite  and see if they can be of use to you.
