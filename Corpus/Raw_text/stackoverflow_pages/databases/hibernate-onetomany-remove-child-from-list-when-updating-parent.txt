*** hibernate-onetomany-remove-child-from-list-when-updating-parent ***

 I have the following entities: 
 TEAM 
 
 } 
 and  
 USER_TEAM_ROLE 
 
 Now, when updating a Team entity that contains for example Team.userTeamRoles = {UTR1, UTR2} with {UTR1, UTR3}, I want UTR2 to be deleted. But the way I do it now, the old list remains the same and it only adds UTR3 to the list.  
 This is how I do it at the moment: 
 
 I thought that by doing   the list would be reset and because of the cascades the previous list would be deleted. 
 Any help is appreciated. Thank you 
 
 
 Instead of replacing the collection ( ) you have to   the existing one. This happens because if Hibernate loads the entity (and its collections) from DB, it "manages" them, ie. tracks their changes. Generally when using Hibernate it's better  **not**
 to create any setters for collections (lists, sets). Create only the getter, and clear the collection returned by it, ie: 
 
 Another thing is that you miss orphan deletion (ie. delete child object when it's removed from collection in the parent). To enable it, you need to add   in owning entity.
