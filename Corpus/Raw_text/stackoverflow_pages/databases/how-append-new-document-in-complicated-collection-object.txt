*** how-append-new-document-in-complicated-collection-object ***

 I have a collection: 
 
 Each collection element consist array of TASKS. Each TASK-element consist Query + List-array. 
 I must append if is possible new   (see diagram) 
 
 But I can not understand, how can I check all in  : 
 
 **Update:**

  (for example from server) for using in  
This values i make in my code and must check if they exist in DB: 
 
 
 **Update v2**

 
 
 Search   and in task-array  in list-array  , and if not found, push new doc in  : 
 
 But in this case mongo insert a new doc in array :( 
 
 
 Can you help me please to add some data in MongoDB collection?
