*** how-can-i-access-amazon-dynamodb-via-python ***

 I'm currently using hbase with my Python apps and wanted to try out Amazon  DynamoDB . Is there a way to use Python to read, write and query data? 
 
 You can use boto:  https://github.com/boto/boto 
 docs:  https://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dynamodb2_tut.html 
 api reference:  https://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/dynamodb2.html 
 
 Another alternative is  PynamoDB . PynamoDB provides an ORM like interface to DynamoDB and supports  **both**
 Python 2 and Python 3. The entire DynamoDB API is supported by PynamoDB - including global and local secondary indexes, batch operations, binary attributes, queries, scans, etc.  
 Disclaimer: I wrote PynamoDB.

 You can use  Dynamodb-mapper  Python library. It's a simple/tiny abstraction layer that allows you to  **map plain Python object to DynamoDB**
. It also features a transaction engine. 
 For advanced tasks such as table management it is still better to directly use  Boto  (which we rely on, anyway). 
 
 This question has been years so I believe your problem was already resolved. Just want to mention that you could use  boto3  to access DynamoDB as well nowadays.
