*** how-can-i-attach-a-database-to-an-app-in-heroku ***

 I'm using Heroku's Postgres addon, and I created a new production database from the Heroku Postgres addon page.
I Didn't add it directly to my App using the Resources page of my App. 
 Now I want to attach this database to my App so it'll be recognized by the  **heroku pg**
 command. 
 I'm able to use the database btw after setting the  **DATABASE_URL**
 config var of my app to point to it, but  **heroku pg**
 command doesn't recognize it yet. 
 Additional info: The previous database was Shared, and the new one is a Production. 
 
 Did you add the database using the app-independent  https://postgres.heroku.com/  site? Or did you just create a postgresql database in your Heroku control panel? 
 If you created your database on  https://postgres.heroku.com/ , you will  not  see the database via your   command. What you can do to add your database to your application, however, would be to: 
 
 Log into  https://postgres.heroku.com/ . 
 Click on the database you want to attach to your application. 
 Under 'Connection Settings', click the configuration button at the top right. 
 Then click the 'URL' option. 
 Copy your database URL, this should be something like "postgres://blah:blah@ec2-23-23-122-88.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/omg". 
 In your application, on the command line, run  
 
 What we did there was assign your database to the   environment variable in your application. This is the variable that's used by default when you provision databases locally to your application, so theoretically, assigning this value should work just fine for you. 
 
 
 Heroku add-ons may now be attached across applications and multiple times on a single app.

 To get your database that you created at  https://postgres.heroku.com/  attached to your actual heroku app that you are working on you can't use any of the  pg backup commands  and as far as I can tell there is no supported Heroku way of attaching a database to a heroku app. 
 You can however create a backup of your database using pg_dump and then use pg_restore to populate your new database that is attached to your app: 
 
 Once that is complete you can populate your new database with: 
 
 Even if you are upgrading from the "basic plan" to a the "crane plan" you still have to do a backup and restore, but since the db's are already attached to your app you have the advantage of using the heroku backup commands.
