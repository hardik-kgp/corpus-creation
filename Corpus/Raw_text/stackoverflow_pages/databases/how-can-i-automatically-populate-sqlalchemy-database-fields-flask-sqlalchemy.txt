*** how-can-i-automatically-populate-sqlalchemy-database-fields-flask-sqlalchemy ***

 I've got a simple User model, defined like so: 
 
 When I create a new User object, my   field gets set to the current time. What I'd like to do is make it so that  whenever  I save changes to my User object my   field is set to the current time automatically. 
 I've scoured the documentation, but for the life of me I can't seem to find any references to this. I'm very new to SQLAlchemy, so I really have no prior experience to draw from. 
 Would love some feedback, thank you. 
 
 Just add   or   argument to the column fields: 
 
 I prefer the   column names. ;) 
 SQLAlchemy docs about  column insert/update defaults . 
 **[Edit]:**
 Updated code to use   arguments in the code. 
 **[Edit 2]:**
 Replaced   with   arguments.
