*** how-can-i-browse-my-heroku-database ***

 Now that I've deployed my webapp to Heroku, how would I be able to browse the database as it's altered over time?  
 
 Try  . For instructions for how to do this, see  this . 
 
 If you want to browse your Heroku PostgreSQL database using a browser there is now a free tool for that called Heroku Data Explorer:
 https://datazenit.com/heroku-data-explorer.html 
 It uses Heroku API in real time so your data/credentials stay secure and private. Also it has excellent performance because Heroku local network is used for database connections. 
 
 I use a tool called  Adminer  to connect to the DB. The problem is that Heroku will change the credentials for the DB occasionally. You can find them by visiting the Resources tab on your Dashboard then clicking on the DB you use. 
 It will take you to the Addons page in another tab. Click on the Settings tab then View Credentials.  
 Using these credentials, you can use  Adminer  to login to the DB. 
 
 Download PgAdmin 4 and configure your heroku database credentials. Right click on   link and choose  . On   tab give   as per your wish and on   tab enter Hostname/address, address, Maintenance database (database name), Username and password which is given in Heroku dabase credentials page. And you will be able to access heroku dadabase on UI free of cost.
