 , but I am getting the following error message: 
 
 **My server version: 5.0.45**

 
 There is no database command to do it. You basically have to do it outside the database. Below are some references outlining possible solutions. It has been answered pretty good in this  question 
 This is probably what it should look like in your case 
 
 After you have verified that everything is in order you can drop the original database.

 [Note on " RENAME DATABASE " command: This statement was added in MySQL 5.1.7 but was found to be dangerous and was removed in MySQL 5.1.23.] 
 
 
 This statement was added in MySQL 5.1.7 but was found to be dangerous and was removed in MySQL 5.1.23. It was intended to enable upgrading pre-5.1 databases to use the encoding implemented in 5.1 for mapping database names to database directory names . However, use of this statement could result in loss of database contents, which is why it was removed. Do not use   in earlier versions in which it is present. 
 To perform the task of upgrading database names with the new encoding, use   instead.  
 
 Use mysql_dump to dump out the database contents of the old schema (it produces SQL output, and can include all the object CREATE statements), switch to the new schema, and execute that script  
 If it's a large database, this may take a while, but it's the safest way to do it (make sure you suspend any applications using the database while the conversion process is going on). 
 Delete the old schema when you're satisfied that everything worked. 
 
 This is done with a   statement: 
 
 This statement was added in MySQL 5.1.7 but was found to be dangerous and was removed in MySQL 5.1.23. 
 
 You can change your database name using Mysql User interface 
 Step1: First of all Go to localhost/phpmyadmin/ and click on your database 
 Step2: Click on Opertaion tab 
 Step3: Enter new database name into (Rename database to) textfield 
 Step4: Click on Go Buttton  
 
 Use  rename database  command. 
 You can also try to stop your mysql server and rename a folder that contains your db data to the name you prefer. Then start your server and check the grants - they might still contain references to your old database name.
