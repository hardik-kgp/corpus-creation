*** how-can-i-check-if-a-view-exists-in-a-database ***

 I have some SQL code that needs to be executed if a certain View exists in a database. How would I go about checking if the View exists? 
 EDIT: The DBMS being used is Microsoft SQL Server 
 
 FOR SQL SERVER 
 
 
 There are already many ways specified above but one of my favourite is missing.. 
 
 WHERE   is the name of view 
 **UPDATE 2017-03-25:**
 as @hanesjw suggested to drop a Store Procedure use   instead of   as the second argument of  
 
 
 This is the most portable, least intrusive way: 
 
 Edit: This does work on SQL Server, and it doesn't require you joining to   to get the schema of the view. This is less important if everything is  , but if you're making good use of schemas, then you should keep that in mind. 
 Each RDBMS has their own little way of checking metadata like this, but   is actually ANSI, and I think Oracle and apparently SQLite are the only ones that don't support it in some fashion. 
 
 
 
 For people checking the existence to drop   use this   
 From   you can use new  DIE   statements instead of big   wrappers 
 syntax 
 
 DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] [ schema_name . ] view_name [ ...,n ] [ ; ]

 if it's Oracle you would use the "all_views" table.  
 It really depends on your dbms. 
 
 If you want to check the validity and consistency of all the existing views you can use the following query 
 
 
 IN SQL Server , 
 
 
 To expand on Kevin's answer. 
 
 
 You can check the availability of the view in various ways 
 FOR SQL SERVER 
 use  **sys.objects**

 
 use  **sysobjects**

 
 use  **sys.views**

 
 use  **INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS**

 
 use  **OBJECT_ID**

 
 use  **sys.sql_modules**
