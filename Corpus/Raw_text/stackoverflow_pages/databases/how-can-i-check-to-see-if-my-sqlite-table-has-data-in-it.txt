*** how-can-i-check-to-see-if-my-sqlite-table-has-data-in-it ***

 **EDIT,
Changed the code slightly based on answers below, but still haven't got it working. I also added a log message to tell me if getCount was returning > 0, and it was, so i supect somthing might be wrong with my query? or my use of the cursor..**

 I've created a table, and i want to check if its empty or not, if it's empty i want to run some insert statements (that are stored in an array). 
 Below is my code, while i have no errors, when i pull the .db file out i can see that it doesn't work. How would you approach this problem?  
 
 Sorry if this is a pretty stupid question or approach, i'm new to all this. Any answers much appreciated! 
 
 The query   on an existing table should  never  return null. If there are no rows in the table, it should return one row containing the value zero. 
 Conversely, a row with a non-zero value indicates that it's  not  empty. 
 In both cases, one row should be returned, meaning that it will always go through the 
 
 section. 
 To fix it, leave your query as-is (you don't want to do   simply because that would be unnecessary and possibly a little inefficient). Leave it as  , which will always return one row, and use the following code (tested only in my head so be careful): 
 
 
 The   returns a   object which is positioned before the first entry (See more info  here )
  will always return a result (considering the table exists) 
 So I would do: 
 
 
 As paxdiablo said, the cursor will not be null. What you can do is try like this: 
 
 **EDIT**

 Actually i had used the db.query() and it worked for me. I did this. 
 
 TABLE_NAME is my table and KEY_TYPE was my columnname 
 
 you mean if it has record right ?
i've tried this and for me it's work 
 
 it will show the sum of the table, 
if the table doesn't have record, then it will show 0. 
 
 You can check it manually : 
 
 Go to DDMS in File Explorer.  
Here you'll get your database file. And if you want to see inserted values in table. 
 Copy  ,  ,   and   files from platform_tools to  tools folder. 
 Then
Open Command Prompt and set your path to "Tools" directory where your android setup exist. It look like as :-   
 After set path you'll write command "adb shell" without quotes.
 
 Press Enter and write path of DDMS told above:-
 
 Press Enter  
 Press Enter And you'll get all table's name existing in that database. 
 
 
 
 All data exists in that table will show. 
 For any further query feel free to comment. 
 
 My way of checking was something like this: 
 
 I get the   entries which in my case are auto-increment. If the DB is empty,   for sure returns true. 
 
 What about this query? 
 
 It's slightly faster that  .  
 P.S. Checked on tables with 9 million rows. 
 
 Another alternative to the one already mentioned would be to use the function
  queryNumEntries  from de class  DatabaseUtils .  
 An example may be as follows: 
 
 
 for java programs this worked for me: 
 
 
 Here's what I did... 
 
 
 My app was crashing trying the above codes, so I did this and now it's working perfectly!
