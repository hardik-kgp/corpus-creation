*** how-can-i-connect-to-an-external-database-from-a-sql-statement-or-a-stored-proce ***

 When running a SQL statement or a stored procedure on a database, can you connect to an external database and pull data from there? 
 something like: 
 
 
 You'll need to  setup a Linked Server instance .  Then you can reference the external database as though it were a SQL Server database. 
 
 Yep -- there's two methods: either use the function  , or use linked servers. OPENROWSET is useful for ad-hoc single statements, but if you're going to be doing this regularly, read up on linked servers as they allow you to do exactly what you've specified in your SQL Statement ... e.g., 
 
  for local data 
  for remote data 
 
 And yes, you can mix and match to do joins twixt local and remote. Note though that you'll need to be caureul if you do joins against large tables that exist on the remote server as the query could take a long time to exexute... 
 
 Yes, you can.  You should take a look at  linked servers  for starters.  You can also use  OPENROWSET  to hit them directly with no linked server. 
 
 Easiest way : 
 
 Click connect to server 
 when it asks for server name use:
 **192.168.X.X,1433\SQLEXPRESS**
 insted of  YOURPC\SQLEXPRESS 
 
 
 (The ip and opened port of target sql server) 
 
 
 Type correct username and password  
 Done!
