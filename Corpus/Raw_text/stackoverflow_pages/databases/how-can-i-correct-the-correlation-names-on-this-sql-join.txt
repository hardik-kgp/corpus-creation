*** how-can-i-correct-the-correlation-names-on-this-sql-join ***

 I need a join that yields three fields with the same name from two different tables. When I try to run my sql query, VS gives me the following error. 
 
 The objects "PoliticalFigures" and "PoliticalFigures" in the FROM clause have the same exposed names. Use correlation names to distinguish them. 
 
 I've been trying to use "AS" to distinguish these fields, but I haven't found a working solution. This is the sql query I'm running: 
 
 If it's not obvious from the code, these are the tables. 
 
 Countries: Id, Name, President_Id, VicePresident_Id. 
 PoliticalFigures: Id, Name. 
 Joined table: Country, President, VicePresident 
 
 (Note, the tables and fields in my application have different names. I am generalizing them to make this example clearer and  hopefully  more relevant to others.) 
 (The tools I'm using are Visual Web Developer 2010 Express and SQL Server 2008 Express.) 
 
 Use table aliases for each reference to   instead: 
 
 
 Give each reference to the table an  alias : 
 
 
 In the SQL Standards, the vernacular 'table alias' is referred to as a   and the vernacular 'column alias' is referred to as an  . It seems you have the two terms confused. 
 
 You need to use AS on the tables to give them aliases:
