*** how-can-i-define-text-type-using-ebean-in-play-framework ***

 When I define a variable in Model class as a String, it is converted as 'VARCHAR(255)' in DB. 
 However, I want to save more than 255 because this data is very long text consisting of several paragraphs. 
 As far as I remember, there is a TEXT type in DB to save very long text.  
 How can I define TEXT type in Play! framework? 
 I tried Constraints.MaxLength and Constraints.Max defined in Play! framework api. 
 However, still 1.sql file (created by Ebean DDL automatically) defines this variable as VARCHAR(255). 
 Thanks, in advance! 
 
 In your model, just use the column definition set as  : 
 
 I already used it with Postgres, don't know if it is ok with other database server. 
 
 You could use the   annotation on your field which will yield type   on MySQL and type   on PostgreSQL: 
 
 in MySQL this yields: 
 
 in PostgreSQL this yields: 
 
 According to the  Java EE api : 
 
 The Lob type is inferred from the type of the persistent field or property 
 
 Which means that a field of type   should give you some text blob and a field of type   should give you some binary blob.
