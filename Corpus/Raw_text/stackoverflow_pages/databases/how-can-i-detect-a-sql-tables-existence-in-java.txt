 How can I detect if a certain table exists in a given SQL database in Java? 
 
 You can use  DatabaseMetaData.getTables()  to get information about existing tables. 
 This method works transparently and is independent of the database engine. I think it queries information schema tables behind the scenes. 
 **Edit:**

 Here is  an example that prints all existing table names . 
 
 
 Use  . If the table exists, you will get a   with one record. 
 See  DatabaseMetaData.getTables 
 
 This is not a language-specific, but a database-specific problem. You'd query the metadata in the database for the existence of that particular object. 
 In SQL Server for instance: 
 
 
 Write a query that queries the table/view that will list the tables (this is different depending on DB vendor). Call that from Java. 
 Googling  information_schema.tables  will help a lot. 
 
 Depending on the DB, you can do (MySQL) 
 
 or (Oracle) 
 
 or another thing for SQL Server.  Cycle through the results for MySQL or further filter on the Oracle one. 
 
 Why not just see if it is in sysobjects (for SQL Server)? 
 
 
 There is a JDBC feature, database vendor independent - see [java.sql.DatabaseMetaData#getTables()][1]  
 You can get the DatabaseMetaData instance by calling  java.sql.Connection#getMetaData()

 For ALL ANSI-compliant databases:
(mySQL, SQL Server 2005/2008, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLLite, maybe others) 
 
 
 This is what worked for me for  : 
 
 Note that   has to be all caps.
