 I'm using Sqlserver express and I can't do   trigger. There's a other way to do that? 
 
 MSSQL does not support   triggers.  The closest you have is   triggers but their behavior is different to that of   triggers in MySQL. 
 You can learn more about them  here , and note that   triggers "Specifies that the trigger is executed instead of the triggering SQL statement, thus overriding the actions of the triggering statements."  Thus, actions on the update may not take place if the trigger is not properly written/handled.  Cascading actions are also affected. 
 You may instead want to use a different approach to what you are trying to achieve. 
 
 It is true that there aren't "before triggers" in MSSQL. However, you could still track the changes that were made on the table, by using the "inserted" and "deleted" tables together. When an update causes the trigger to fire, the "inserted" table stores the new values and the "deleted" table stores the old values. Once having this info, you could relatively easy simulate the "before trigger" behaviour. 
 
 Can't be sure if this applied to SQL Server  Express , but you can still access the "before" data even if your trigger is happening AFTER the update. You need to read the data from either the  **deleted**
 or  **inserted**
 table that is created on the fly when the table is changed. This is essentially what @Stamen says, but I still needed to explore further to understand that (helpful!) answer. 
 
 The  **deleted**
 table stores copies of the affected rows during DELETE and
  UPDATE statements. During the execution of a DELETE or UPDATE
  statement, rows are deleted from the trigger table and transferred to
  the deleted table... 
 The  **inserted**
 table stores copies of the affected rows during INSERT
  and UPDATE statements. During an insert or update transaction, new
  rows are added to both the inserted table and the trigger table...

 So you can create your trigger to read data from one of those tables, e.g. 
 
 My example is based on the one here:

 sql-server   triggers 
 
 T-SQL supports only AFTER and INSTEAD OF triggers, it does not feature a BEFORE trigger, as found in some other RDBMSs. 
 I believe you will want to use an INSTEAD OF trigger. 
 
 All "normal" triggers in SQL Server are "AFTER ..." triggers. There are no "BEFORE ..." triggers. 
 To do something before an update, check out  INSTEAD OF UPDATE Triggers . 
 
 To do a   in SQL Server I use a trick. I do a false update of the record ( ), in such way I get the previous image of the record. 
 
 Remember that when you use an instead trigger, it will not commit the insert unless you specifically tell it to in the trigger. Instead of really means do this instead of what you normally do, so none of the normal insert actions would happen.
