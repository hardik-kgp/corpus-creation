*** how-can-i-edit-a-view-using-phpmyadmin-3-2-4 ***

 I need to simply edit a very complicated view in phpMyAdmin 3.2.4 but I cannot figure how to do that. Any suggestions?
Thanks! 
 
 To expand one what CheeseConQueso is saying, here are the entire steps to update a view using PHPMyAdmin: 
 
 Run the following query:  
 Expand the options and choose  **Full Texts**

 Press  **Go**

 Copy entire contents of the  **Create View**
 column. 
 Make changes to the query in the editor of your choice 
 Run the query directly (without the  ... syntax) to make sure it runs as you expect it to. 
 Once you're satisfied, click on your view in the list on the left to browse its data and then scroll all the way to the bottom where you'll see a  **CREATE VIEW**
 link. Click that. 
 Place a check in the  **OR REPLACE**
 field. 
 In the  **VIEW name**
 put the name of the view you are going to update. 
 In the  **AS**
 field put the contents of the query that you ran while testing (without the   syntax). 
 Press  **Go**

 
 I hope that helps somebody. Special thanks to CheesConQueso for his/her insightful answer. 
 
 try running   in the sql portion of phpmyadmin and you will have a better idea of what is inside the view 
 
 In your database table list it should show View in Type column.
To edit View: 
 
 Click on your View in table list 
 Click on Structure tab 
 Click on Edit View under Check All 
 
 
 Hope this help 
 **update:**
 in PHPMyAdmin 4.x, it doesn't show View in Type, but you can still recognize it: 
 
 In Row column: It had zero Row 
 In Action column: It had greyed empty button 
 
 Of course it may be just an empty table, but when you open the structure, you will know whether it's a table or a view. 
 
 Just export you view and you will have all SQL need to make some change on it.  
 Just need to add your change in SQL query for the view and change :  
 **CREATE**
 for  **CREATE OR REPLACE**
