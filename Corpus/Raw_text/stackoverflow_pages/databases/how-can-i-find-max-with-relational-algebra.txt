 Working with databases, how can I find MAX using relational algebra? 
 
 Assuming you have a relation, A, with a single attribute, 'a' (reducing a more complex relation to this is a simple task in relational algebra, I'm sure you got this far), so now you want to find the maximum value in A. 
 One way to do it is to find the cross product of A with itself, be sure to rename 'a' so your new relation has attributes with distinct names. for example: 
 (rename 'a' as 'a1') X (rename 'a' as 'a2') 
 now select 'a1' < 'a2', the resulting relation will have all values except the maximum. To get the max simply find the difference between your original relation: 
 
 Then use the   operator to reduce down to a single column as  Tobi Lehman suggests in the comment below. 
 Writing this in relational algebra notation would be (if I remember correctly). Note the final rename (i.e. ρ) is just to end up with an attribute that has the same name as in the original relation: 
 ρ a/a1 (π a1 ((A x A) - σ a1 < a2  (ρ a1/a (A) x ρ a2/a (A)))) 
 
 Just my two cents as I was trying to solve this today myself. 
 Lets say we have A = 1,2,3  
 If you use  
 
 you will not get the single max value rather two columns like 1|1, 2|1,3|2,3|1,3|2,3|3 
 the way to get just 3 is  
 
 At least that is what I had to do in a similar situation. 
 Hope it helps someone 
 
 lets think we have a relation with an attribute A and values 1,2,3 
 
 so now..  
project A values and rename with A1 
 
 again 
project A values and rename with A2 
 
 join this with    i.e    
so the - Output schema: (A2 integer, A1 integer) 
 
 hear always A2 values will be less than A1 because we   like that( ) 
 now project A2 the output is like below 
 
 now diff with original attribute  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Output is  
which is maximum value

 I've forgotten most of the  relational algebra  syntax now. A query just using  ,  ,   and   would be 
 
 Hopefully you can translate! 
 
 I know this is old, but here is a hand-written formula which might be handy!  
 
 Relation A: 1,2,3,4 
 
 
 **Find the MAX:**

 
 Strategy: 
 
 Find those   that are not the  . 
 
 Rename   relation as   so that we can compare each     with all others. 
 
 Use   to find those     that were not found in the earlier step.  
 
 The query is:
