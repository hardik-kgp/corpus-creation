*** how-can-i-get-column-names-from-a-table-in-oracle ***

 I need to query the database to get the  column names , not to be confused with data in the table.  For example, if I have a table named   that contains  ,  ,  , and  , then I would want to retrieve those field names from the query and nothing else. 
 I found how to do this in: 
 
 Microsoft SQL Server 
 MySQL 
 PostgreSQL 
 
 But I need to know:  **how can this be done in **
**Oracle**
**?**

 
 You can query the USER_TAB_COLUMNS table for table column metadata. 
 
 
 In SQL Server... 
 
 Type = 'V' for views
Type = 'U' for tables 
 
 You can do this: 
 
 or 
 
 Note: only applicable if you know the table name and specifically for Oracle. 
 
 For SQL Server 2008, we can use information_schema.columns for getting column information 
 
 
 For SQLite I believe you can use something like the following:  
 
 Explanation from sqlite.org: 
 This pragma returns one row for each column in the named table. Columns in the result set include the column name, data type, whether or not the column can be NULL, and the default value for the column. The "pk" column in the result set is zero for columns that are not part of the primary key, and is the index of the column in the primary key for columns that are part of the primary key. 
 See also:  Sqlite.org Pragma Table Info 
 
 That information is stored in the   system table: 
 
 Or you could   the table if you are using SQL*PLUS: 
 
 
 The other answers sufficiently answer the question, but I thought I would share some additional information. Others describe the "DESCRIBE table" syntax in order to get the table information. If you want to get the information in the same format, but without using DESCRIBE, you could do: 
 
 Probably doesn't matter much, but I wrote it up earlier and it seems to fit. 
 
 
 
 For Oracle 
 
 
 
 In your case : 
 
 
 For MySQL, use  
 
 
 For SQL Server: 
 
 
 Even this is also one of the way we can use it 
 
 
 
 
 You could also try this, but it might be more information than you need: 
 
 
 Mysql 
 
 This will return a result something like this: 
 
 Then to pull out the values you can simply 
 
 This is also great for passing input dynamically since the REGEXP needs the '|' for multiple inputs, but is also a way to keeps data separated and easy to store/pass to classes/functions. 
 Try throwing in dummy data as well for security when sending it out and compare what was returned when receiving any errors.  
 
 In Oracle, there is two views that describe columns: 
 
 DBA_TAB_COLUMNS describes the columns of all tables, views, and
clusters in the database. 
 USER_TAB_COLUMNS describes the columns of the tables, views, and 
clusters owned by the current user. This view does not display the 
OWNER column. 
 
 
 The answer is here:  http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-list-fields.php 
I'd use the following code in your case: 
 
 
 
 
 **you can run this query**

 
 
 Just select first row from the table , for oracle :  
 
 Came across this question looking for access to column names on Teradata, so I'll add the answer for their 'flavour' of SQL: 
 
 The info is stored in the DBC dbase. 
 Getting data types is a little bit more involved: 
 Get column type using teradata system tables 
 
 Try this 
 
 
 I did it like this 
 
 It works even in  http://data.stackexchange.com  whose service tables I am not aware of!
