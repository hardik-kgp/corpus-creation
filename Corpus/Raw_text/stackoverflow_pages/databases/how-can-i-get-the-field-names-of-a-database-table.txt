 How can I get the field names of an MS Access database table? 
 Is there an SQL query I can use, or is there C# code to do this? 
 
 this will work on sql server 2005 and up: 
 
 
 Use  IDataReader.GetSchemaTable() 
 Here's an actual example that accesses the table schema and prints it plain and in XML (just to see what information you get): 
 
 **Points of interest:**

 
 Don't return any data by giving a where clause that always evaluates to false. Of course this only applies if you're not interested in the data :-). 
 Use IDataReader.GetSchemaTable() to get a DataTable with detailed info about the actual table. 
 
 **For my test table the output was:**

 
 
 Run this query: 
 
 and then walk the list fields (and returned values) in the result set to get the field names. 
 
 Are you asking how you can get the column names of a table in a Database? 
 If so it completely depends on the Database Server you are using. 
 In SQL 2005 you can select from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Columns View 
 
 IN SQL 2000 you can join SysObjects to SysColumns to get the info 
 
 
 Use the DAO automation classes. You may already have an interop library for it in your Visual Studio installation. If not, it's easy enough to create one; just add a reference to the DAO COM library. 
 
 This is just as easy as querying a system table (which I've found to be problematic in Access), and you can get a lot of additional information this way. 
 **EDIT:**

I've modified the code from what I posted yesterday, which I had just translated from VB.NET, and which was missing a couple of pieces. I've rewritten it and tested it in C# in VS2008. 
 
 This Code will print all column name of a table as a class with   property of all column names which can be then used in   code 
 
 **Output:**

 
 
 Depending on the DB engine your using you can easily query the DB system tables for that information 
 For access i can't find the answer i know you  can see the sys tables  in access and from there you could try and determine where that information is but im not really sure how to do this part. tried using an example but got nowwhere 
 
 for microsoft SQL in c# you can do the following: 
 
 thus creates a map of column name into its index which can be used as follows: 
 
 
 I have had good luck with the GetSchema property of the OleDb.Connection: 
 A class to provide column data. This returns ALL columns in the database. The resulting DataTable can then be filtered by column names which correspond (mostly) to those found in a standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA (which MS Access does NOT provide for us): 
 
 Then, Consuming the class in a rather crude and not-so-elegant example, and filtering on TABLE_NAME: 
 
 Note that I do not pretend that this is all well-though out code. It is only an example. But I have used something like this on a number of occasions, and in fact even created an application to script out an entire MS Access database (contraints and all) using similar methods.  
 While I have seen others in this thread mention the get Schema, it seem slike some of the implementation was overly complicated . . . 
 Hope that helps!
