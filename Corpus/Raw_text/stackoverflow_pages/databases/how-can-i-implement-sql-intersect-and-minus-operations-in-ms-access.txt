*** how-can-i-implement-sql-intersect-and-minus-operations-in-ms-access ***

 I have researched and haven't found a way to run INTERSECT and MINUS operations in MS Access. Does any way exist 
 
 INTERSECT is an inner join.  MINUS is an outer join, where you choose only the records that don't exist in the other table.
 
 INTERSECT 
 
 
 MINUS 
 
 If you edit your original question and post some sample data then an example can be given. 
 EDIT: Forgot to add in the distinct to the queries. 
 
 INTERSECT is NOT an INNER JOIN.  They're different.  An INNER JOIN will give you duplicate rows in cases where INTERSECT WILL not.  You can get equivalent results by: 
 
 Note that PK must be the primary key column or columns.  If there is no PK on the table (BAD!), you must write it like so: 
 
 With MINUS, you can do the same thing, but with a LEFT JOIN, and a WHERE condition checking for null on one of table b's non-nullable columns (preferably the primary key). 
 
 That should do it.    
 
 They're done through JOINs.  The old fashioned way :) 
 For INTERSECT, you can use an INNER JOIN. Pretty straightforward. Just need to use a GROUP BY or DISTINCT if you have don't have a pure one-to-one relationship going on. Otherwise, as others had mentioned, you can get more results than you'd expect. 
 For MINUS, you can use a LEFT JOIN and use the WHERE to limit it so you're only getting back rows from your main table that don't have a match with the LEFT JOINed table. 
 Easy peasy. 
 
 Unfortunately MINUS is not supported in MS Access - one workaround would be to create three queries, one with the full dataset, one that pulls the rows you want to filter out, and a third that left joins the two tables and only pulls records that only exist in your full dataset. 
 Same thing goes for INTERSECT, except you would be doing it via an inner join and only returning records that exist in both. 
 
 I believe this one does the MINUS
