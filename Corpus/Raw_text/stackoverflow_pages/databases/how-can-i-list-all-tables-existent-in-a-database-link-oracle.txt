*** how-can-i-list-all-tables-existent-in-a-database-link-oracle ***

 Basically I have a Database link (Oracle) called  mylink.domain , in this link we can access foundation information like name of them members and other general information. 
 I would like to list all table's name in this link but i don't know how to do that. 
 Thanks in advance 
 
 You can access the   view through the dblink: 
 
 
 Selecting the content of ALL_TABLES dictionary view will list you all tables your user has access to. Generally, it is not always possible to get a list of tables you dont have permissions for - they just do not show up. If your user has the SELECT ANY DICTIONARY priviledge, you can select the content of DBA_TABLES, which will always list all tables existing in the database. 
 
 select table_name from all_tables@dblinkname; 
 This shows all tables your linked user has access to.
