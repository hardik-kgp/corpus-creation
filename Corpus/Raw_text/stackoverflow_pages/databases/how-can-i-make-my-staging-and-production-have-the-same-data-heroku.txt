*** how-can-i-make-my-staging-and-production-have-the-same-data-heroku ***

 I've looked at Heroku's Taps project ( http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/taps )
but there's a huge constraint on foreign keys, so I'm uncomfortable with using this. 
 All I want to do is get my production data safely and put it on my staging app so the two are more closely matched. Advice? 
 
 Thoughtbot posted this a few weeks ago: 
 You need the pgbackups addon (free), and use this to transfer from production to staging

 Edit: Make sure you have your git branches "staging" and "production" pointing to the heroku apps. 
 
 
 If your staging app is using Postgre SQL as well, you can export your data as a backup using pgbackup (http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups#exporting_via_a_backup) and then just copy it into your db folder. If not, you may have to use a conversion tool.
