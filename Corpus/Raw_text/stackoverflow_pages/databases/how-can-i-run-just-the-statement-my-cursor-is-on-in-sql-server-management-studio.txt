*** how-can-i-run-just-the-statement-my-cursor-is-on-in-sql-server-management-studio ***

 As a long time Toad for Oracle user, I have gotten used to hitting Ctrl+Enter and having just the statement under the cursor be executed. 
 In SQL Server Management Studio, hitting F5 runs the entire script. To run just the current statement, I have to manually highlight the statement I want, and then hit F5. 
 That is really annoying to me. Does anyone know of a tool with a keyboard shortcut to run just the current statement on a SQL Server? I would change tools just for this one feature. 
 Note: Oddly enough, even the free  Toad for SQL Server  does not let you run just the statement under the cursor. 
 
 You can check out this add-in for SSMS 2012. Place the cursor within the statement you want to execute and press  CTRL + SHIFT + E 
 SSMS Executor - https://github.com/devvcat/ssms-executor/releases 
 **Update:**

Project moved to github and the addin re-written to support SSMS 2014, SSMS 2016. (Previously, the project lived on codeplex, at  SSMS Executor - http://ssmsexecutor.codeplex.com/ .) 
 
 Use  Ctrl + KU  to select a line.
Then use  F5  to run it. 
 Although it only works for single line selection, still I find it quite useful. 
 Hope it helps!! 
 
 Ok, so what I'm getting from all these answers is "No, that is not possible." 
 **Edit:**

 Here is how I was able to do this: 
 1 - Download  SQL Developer 
 2 - Download the  jTDS driver 
 3 - Follow  these instructions  to add that driver to SQL Developer 
 4 - Connect to SQL Server using SQL Developer (cool!) 
 5 - Run it and life is good 
 
 Somebody suggested this features  on Devart dbForge SQL Complete (addon for Management Studio) , and  it's still in the development stage. Let's hope that it's finished and doesn't get abandoned halfway through development. 
 
 
 Note: Oddly enough, even the free Toad
  for SQL Server does not let you run
  just the statement under the cursor. 
 
 It is really annoying that TOAD does not hold to what it promises: 
 From TOAD help:  [F9 to execute] a portion of a statement, which can contain one or more statements. You can select the portion of the statement by placing the cursor within or adjacent to the statement, or by selecting the statement. 
Note: Toad considers "adjacent" all statements (including comments) separated from the cursor or from each other by fewer than two blank lines. If an error occurs during statement execution, an error message displays, allowing you to either ignore the error and continue or to abort execution. 
 I tried it million times but it simply executes the whole script. I wanted to search for it in the user support group (toadss(at)yahoogroups.com) but yahoo has the stupidest search facility ever! It can't even find the keyword "toad" in the toad mail group, DOH!  
 I think TOAD is the best querying tool ever, but the lack of this feature really annoys me too.  
 **UPDATE: SOLUTION FOUND!**

I asked this issue in toadss mail group and got the answer. Unlike Oracle, you have to separate statements in SQL Server with the keyword  **GO**
 after each statement. Only if you do that the F9 button works as expected, executing the current statement. 
 
 Above answer helped me to create a shortcut to Execute current Statement without selecting the query 
 1 - Click on  **Tools**
 >  **Options**
 >  **Environment**
 >  **Keyboard**

 2 - For  **Show commands**
 containing, set it to  **SqlComplete10.Common_ExecuteCurrentStatement**

 3 - For Use new shortcut in, set it to  **SQL Query Editor**

 4 - For Press shortcut keys(desired shortcut key), perform the Ctrl-Enter combination. 
 5 - Click on  **Assign**
. Click on OK. 
 
 I use a workaround: I comment queries I'm not using. You can use CTRL-K, CTRL-C to comment the SQL you've highlighted. Use CTRL-K, CTRL-U to uncomment. That way, you can comment all other queries, and execute the one you're interested in with F5. 
 
 I don't think this is possible to do using just the management studio.
BUT you can use keyboard shortcut software (e.g.  http://www.autohotkey.com/ ) to have a special sequence recorded and assigned to a hotkey.
In your case you need: 
 
 This will select the current line and execute it. 
 
 In Toad for SQL Server the following default hot-keys can be used for execution: 
 
 F5: Execute all SQL statements in editor 
 F9: Execute SQL statement at current cursor position 
 Shift-F9: Execute all SQL statements from cursor, including the current at cursor position 
 
 However, like 'ercan' wrote, you need to seperate/follow each statement with 'GO'. 
 
 
 If it's the having to move your hand to the mouse part that bothers you, you can hold the Ctrl down while hitting an up or down arrow key to select a line at once.   
 
 Hit  Ctrl - E  while text is highlighted. 
 
 SQL Complete Express edition has this built in. But you don't get it without the custom intellisense. 
 (I got this from Salamander2007's post) 
 
 If the executor add-on solution (in the top posted answer) isn't working properly, i got it to work for me (SSMS v17.8.1):
The add-on adds a command under tools:  **Tools > Execute Inner Statement**
. 
 You can assign a custom keyboard shortcut key to it by going to  **Tools > Options > Keyboard**
 then search for "execute" in the 'Show commands containing:' and selecting  **Tools.ExecuteInnerStatement**
. 
Then just assign your desired keystroke(s) in the 'Press shortcut keys:' field and hit the Assign button. 
 
 I used this work around; when code is not commented out   
 
 Ctrl + K + U 
 
 (this command highlight current query line) and then  
 
 Ctrl + E 
 
 (this run highlighted query). 
 It is useful when you want to run a single line query between some other lines like : 
 
 
 This feature is present in  SSMSBoost  add-in for SSMS (I am the developer of this add-in): 
 **Shift-F5**
 will select the current statement (which allows you to review what you are currently going to execute). Then you press  **F5**
 and execute it.  
 
 you could always use the command line tools sqlcmd and osql.  I did a lot of sybase all at the unix command line using a wrapper function that passed my command string into the equivalent (which i think was isql?).  I used vi to, so maybe I was just crazy then ;-) 
 
 Just select (highlight) the single statement you want to run and hit F5. 
 
 You can combine the two Tools as follow : SQL Complete from dbForce and AuhotHotkey. 
 With SQL Complete: you can execute the current statement at the cursor, by pressing the combination Ctrl Shift E 
 The reason that I used the AutoHotkey is to make life easier :-) by using just F6 to execute the current statement, by setting the following code in AutoHotkey script: 
 
 And voilÃ  you can execute any current statement at the cursor by just pressing F6 
 But sometimes, again my big problem is I mistakely press F5 instead of F6 :D 
 
 Redgate's SQL Prompt extension for SSMS can do this. 
 It's not free but in my experience it's well worth having.  Better intellisense than the SSMS out of the box version, tab colouring, tab history (so valuable!), snippets, single statement (not just a single line) execution, and lots more. 
 
 To run just a section of a larger script, try this .. 
 Steps: 
 
 Collapse the SQL statement you want to run by clicking the minus sign in the left margin next to the statement. That will show only the first line (with an ellipsis "..." to indicate more code not shown) and the ending ";" for the statement. 
 Highlight the line. 
 Press [F5] key.  
 
 That will run just the highlighted statement. If you want to run more than the one
statement at a time, collapse each statement and highlight all that you want to run, then click [F5]. 
It's a work-around, but still much easier than having to drag and highlight numerous lines of code every time. 
 
 Easiest way to do this is assignment for   +   combination for action  **Query.Execute**
 in  . 
 
 Open   menu. 
 Select   page in left pane. 
 Find   action and select it. 
 Set   in   dropdown list. 
 Now type   combination in   textbox. 
 Click the   button. 
 Change   to  
 Click  .  . 
 
 
 The following works for me ... I use SSMS 2012 
 1 - Click on Tools > Options > Environment Keyboard 
 2 - For  **Show commands containing**
, set it to  **Query.Execute**
  
 3 - For  **Use new shortcut in**
, set it to  **SQL Query Editor**

 4 - For  **Press shortcut keys**
, perform the Ctrl-Enter combination. 
 5 - Click on Assign.  Click on OK.
