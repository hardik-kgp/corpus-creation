*** how-can-i-set-default-storage-engine-used-by-mysql ***

 I've been working on writing SQL to create a MySQL database with several default options, including character set and collation.  Is it possible to set the default storage engine for tables in this database to InnoDB?  
 I've been looking through the MySQL 5.1 manual and I've found the statement   which would be appended to a   statement, but I haven't found anything related to a   statement.   
 Is there a normal way to do this as part of the database creation, or does it need to be specified on a table-by-table basis? 
 
 Quoting the Reference Manual ( Setting the Storage Engine ): 
 
 If you omit the   option, the default storage engine is used. Normally, this is MyISAM, but you can change it by using the   server startup option, or by setting the   option in the   configuration file. 
 
 The default-storage-engine option must be part of the mysqld section in  **my.cnf**
; 
 
 You may also want to change the default storage engine just for the current session. You can do this by setting the   variable: 
 
 
 you need to specify the default storage engine when starting mysqld. for example:
