*** how-can-i-stop-the-movement-of-the-nodes-in-neo4j ***

 I'm using Neo4j with webadmin interface.  
 When I run a query I display the nodes and relationships graphically. 
However, whenever I move a node, the other nodes connected to it move too.
How can I stop this " force-attraction " effect? 
 Thank you very much 
 
 There's no way to turn off this behaviour specifically within the browser although when you manually move a node, it becomes "pinned" to that location so will then not move when its neighbours do. 
 If you think you would find more control over the node movements useful, you could always raise an issue or pull request on GitHub.
