*** how-can-i-tell-where-mongodb-is-storing-data-its-not-in-the-default-data-db ***

 My host came with a mongodb instance and there is no /db directory so now I am wondering what I can do to find out where the data is actually being stored. 
 
  defaults the database location to  . 
 If you run   and you don't see a   which explicitly tells   to look at that parameter for the db location and you don't have a   in your  , then the default location will be:   and you should look there. 
 
 What does your configuration file say? 
 
 If it is not correct, try this, your database files will be present on the list: 
 
 It's   on my default installation (Ubuntu 11.04). 
 Note that there is also a   file holding   PID for convenience, however it is located in the data directory - which we are looking for... 
 
 In the newer version of mongodb v2.6.4 try: 
 
 It will give you something like this: 
 
 And that is where it stores the data. 
 
 While this question is targeted for Linux/Unix instances of Mongo, it's one of the first search results regardless of the operating system used, so for future Windows users that find this: 
 If MongoDB is set up as a Windows Service in the default manner, you can usually find it by looking at the 'Path to executable' entry in the MongoDB Service's Properties: 
 
 
 From my experience the default location is   after I do 
 
 
 I find   the most robust way to find actual path if you can connect to the server. The "parsed.storage.dbPath" contains the path your server is currently using and is available both when it's taken from the config or from the command line arguments.  
 Also in my case it was important to make sure that the config value reflects the actual value (i.e. config didn't change after the last restart), which isn't guaranteed by the solutions offered here. 
 
 Example output: 
 
 
 I found mine here on a OSX system
/usr/local/var/mongodb 
 
 For windows Go inside MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin folder and open mongod.cfg file in any text editor. Then locate the line that specifies the dbPath param. The line looks something similar 
 
 dbPath: D:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\data 
 
 
 Found it just by poking around in  .  Thanks for the help though--I am sure these answers apply to other systems (e.g. Ubuntu) and will help others! 
 
 If you could somehow locate mongod.log and the do a grep over it 
 
 The value for dbpath is the data location for mongodb!! 
All the best :) 
 
 Actually, the default directory where the mongod instance stores its data is 
  on Linux and OS X,  
  on Windows 
 If you  **installed MongoDB using a package management system**
, check the   file provided by your packages to see the directory is specified. 
 The   setting is available only for  . 
 The Linux package init scripts do not expect   to change from the defaults. If you use the Linux packages and change  , you will have to use your own init scripts and disable the built-in scripts. 
 
 When you start it up it shows you.  But I don't know if it is something you can do or not on your host.  If you have access to the command line and can restart the service, you will get something like:
