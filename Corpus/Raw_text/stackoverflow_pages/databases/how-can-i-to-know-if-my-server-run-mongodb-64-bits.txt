*** how-can-i-to-know-if-my-server-run-mongodb-64-bits ***

 I have a remote server in linode with ubuntu lucid 10.04 64 bits. 
 I have installed mongodb from mongodb repo: 
 If I write mongo in console I get: 
 
 I want to know if my database mongodb is 64 bits. I can not use 32 bits mongodb database. I need use 64 bits mongodb database. 
 **How or where can I check it?**

 **If my database mongodb is not 64 bits, how can I install mongodb 64 bits in ubuntu lucid 10.04 64bits?**

 Thank you! 
 
 You can use the buildInfo command to find out what build your server is. Look for the value fo the bits field to see if you are using a 64-bit build. 
 
 
 As of v2.4.6, my mongo client displays the following as soon as it connects to  , if the server is 32-bit. I don't even need to run a command.
