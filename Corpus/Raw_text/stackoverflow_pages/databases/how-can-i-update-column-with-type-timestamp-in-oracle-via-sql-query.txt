*** how-can-i-update-column-with-type-timestamp-in-oracle-via-sql-query ***

 But I have no idea how I can do it. 
 Could you help me, please?

 If you want the current time (including the timestamp precision), you could use either systimestamp or current_timestamp 
 
 If you just set the value to sysdate, the fractional seconds part of the timestamp is zeroed out as the date is implicitly converted to timestamp.
