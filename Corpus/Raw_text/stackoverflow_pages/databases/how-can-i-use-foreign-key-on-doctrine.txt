*** how-can-i-use-foreign-key-on-doctrine ***

 I am making the lesson administration system on symfony2 and doctrine 
 I am confused to use foreign key in doctrine. 
 /Entity/User.php 
 
 /Entity/Lesson.php 
 
 Each 'Lesson' has one teacher registered in User.php. 
 How can I write annotation for this purpose?  
 I am also planning that each Lesson has multiple students from /Entity/User.
How can I write annotation for this purpose? (ManyToMany?) 
 I have researched ,but I couldn't find good documents for doctrine annotation. 
 thanks a lot 
 
 Here some cheat sheets for doctrine annotations :  link 
 For your problem, you need to define your variables in each side of your associations.  
 In Lesson.php :  
 
 In User.php : 
 
 And yes, ManyToMany is good for the purpose your are looking for :)
