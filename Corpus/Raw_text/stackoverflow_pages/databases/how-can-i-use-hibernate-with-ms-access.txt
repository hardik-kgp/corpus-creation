*** how-can-i-use-hibernate-with-ms-access ***

 I want to use hibernate with MS Access. Which dialect should I use and can you give me a sample hibernate configuration file with MS Access? 
 
 For MS Access, you'll need the dialect from  HXTT . You'll need to use the  hibernate support package  provided by HXTT. There is also a  sample project  that you can check for a fully working example.  
 Below, a sample minimal configuration: 
 
 PS: If MS Access is not a written in stone requirement, maybe you should consider using something else like... well, anything. 
 
 **Actual solution here!**
  
 After spending 1 day trying out different solutions ODBC, HXTT, etc. I found this beauty :)  http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html .  
 It couldn't be any simpler: just add the jars from the site to your project libs and.  
 **META-INF/persistence.xml**

 
 **Spring config:**

 
 And you're good to go. ;) 
 
 You can use an other strategy and a free strategy to resolve this problem (HXTT is not free) :

 Personaly I got an exception when I try to reverse engineering the ms database (org.hibernate.exception.GenericJDBCException: Error while reading primary key meta data), yet it works for many people. 
 
 As a late note (commenting is not available for me): UCanAccess surely works, although I don't (yet) have experience with writing data. Anyways, regarding the dialect to use, I run with 
 
 because UCanAccess use HSQLDB, and I suppose that dialect is the best match. There isn't any sql actually hitting ms-access in the picture here, jackcess reads and writes directly to the access mdb-file, there is no microsoft code interpreting any sql anywhere, as far as I can understand, and therefore using SQLServerDialect will only confuse HSQLDB code trying to understand it. 
 
 @Firstthumb. Sorry, this is not really an answer but just expressing a comment. I was in the same boat - considering using MS Access to develop a local tipping competition for the Football World Cup 2010. I could access MS Access directly using the Oledb but as a training exercise to reskill a bunch of Java developers moving to .NET, I wanted to show the usage of nHibernate as the DAO layer.  
 After investigating the non-availability of a robust and supported dialect from JBoss/Hibernate team and other considerations, I decided to forego the exercise on using MSAccess. I downloaded the free SQL Express 2008 instead.  
 For those who still want to use MSAccess in .NET, please see  this link )
