*** how-can-i-use-sqlbulkcopy-with-binary-data-byte-in-a-datatable ***

 I'm trying to use SqlBulkCopy to import a bunch of data to our website. In most of the other areas we're using Entity model which uses byte arrays to represent binary data in SQL. However, SqlBulkCopy seems to be confusing byte[] with string. Everything seems to be working fine except for this one binary column which throws an exception: "The given value of type String from the data source cannot be converted to type binary of the specified target column."

 This uses a test database with a   table which has a single   column named  . 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated 
 
 Instead of: 
 
 Add the "Data" column as a binary:
