*** how-do-categories-and-subcategories-for-woocommerce-are-saved-in-db ***

 I have a problem with categories and subcategories in WordPress plugin - WooCommerce.
I'm creating a script which would create a categories and subcategories, the problem is that I don't fully understand how all this works in WooCommerce DB structure. 
 That's what I was able to do: 
 In "wp_terms": 
 
 In "wp_term_taxonomy": 
 
 And that's working, but why the hell this don't: 
 In "wp_term_taxonomy": 
 
 
 
 
 You have to look into table wp_options for option_name "product_cat_children", there is serialized category hierarchy. 
 
 Maybe because one is the parent and the other the child, so if you define this relation, it's right that the opposite shouldn't work. 
 
 You need one more step :  add your catoegory to the right products in : wp_term_relationships
