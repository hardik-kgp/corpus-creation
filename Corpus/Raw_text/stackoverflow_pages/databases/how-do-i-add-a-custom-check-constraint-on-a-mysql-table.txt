*** how-do-i-add-a-custom-check-constraint-on-a-mysql-table ***

 I am having trouble with this table 
 
 I want to have a foreign key constraint, and that works. Then, I also want to add a constraint to the attribute   so it can only take the values 'a', 'd' and 'u'. It is not possible for me to set the field as   or  . 
 Can anyone tell me why this code does not work in MySQL? 
 
  constraints are not supported by MySQL. You can define them, but they do nothing (as of MySQL 5.7).  
 From the  manual : 
 
 The   clause is parsed but ignored by all storage engines. 
 
 The workaround is to create  triggers , but they aren't the easiest thing to work with. 
 If you want an open-source RDBMS that supports   constraints, try  PostgreSQL . It's actually a very good database. 
 
 I don't understand why nobody here has mentioned that  **VIEW WITH CHECK OPTION**
 can be a good alternative to the  **CHECK CONSTRAINT**
 in MySQL: 
 
 There is a doc on the MySQL site:  The View WITH CHECK OPTION Clause 
 
 **P.S.:**
 Keep in mind that your view should be updatable! See  MySQL Updatable Views 
(thanks Romeo Sierra for clarification in comments). 
 
 Beside triggers, for simple constraints like the one you have: 
 
 you could use a   from   to a Reference table (  with 3 rows:   ): 
 
 
 As I explained in  this article , starting with version 8.0.16, MySQL has added support for CHECK constraints: 
 
 Previously, this was only available using BEFORE INSERT and BEFORE UPDATE triggers: 
 
 For more details about emulating CHECK constraints using database triggers for MySQL versions prior to 8.0.16, then check out  this article . 
 
 Here is a way of getting the checks you wanted quickly and easily:
