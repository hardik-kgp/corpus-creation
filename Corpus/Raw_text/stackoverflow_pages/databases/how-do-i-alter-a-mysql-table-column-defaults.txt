*** how-do-i-alter-a-mysql-table-column-defaults ***

 I have a table with a column of type   which defaults   and updates to   on every update. 
 I want to remove the "on update" feature on this column.  How do I write the alter statement? 
 I tried the following:   
 
 but this didn't work. 
 
 Pete was almost correct but used the wrong syntax for 'change': 
 
 Notice that you must repeat the column name.  Also, make sure you are using backticks instead of single quotes to escape the column name time, which prevents it from being interpreted as the mysql column type of time. 
 By specifying the DEFAULT of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, MySQL will no longer automatically update the column.  From the  MySQL Manual : 
 
 With a DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP clause and no ON UPDATE clause, the column has the current timestamp for its default value but is not automatically updated. 
 
 
 You can't AFAIK use functions such as NOW() as a default. 
 Try 
 
 (Edited to add escaping and second use of field name)
