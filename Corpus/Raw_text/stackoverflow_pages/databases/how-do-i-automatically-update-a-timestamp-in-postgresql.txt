*** how-do-i-automatically-update-a-timestamp-in-postgresql ***

 I want the code to be able to automatically update the time stamp when a new row is inserted as I can do in MySQL using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. 
 How will I be able to achieve this in PostgreSQL? 
 
 
 To populate the column during insert, use a   value: 
 
 Note that the value for that column can explicitly be overwritten by supplying a value in the   statement. If you want to prevent that you do need a  trigger .  
 You also need a trigger if you need to update that column whenever the row is updated (as  mentioned by E.J. Brennan ) 
 Note that using reserved words for column names is usually not a good idea. You should find a different name than  
 
 You'll need to write an insert trigger, and possible an update trigger if you want it to change when the record is changed. This article explains it quite nicely:

 Apply the trigger like this: 
 
 
 
 Updating timestamp, only if the values changed 
 Based on E.J's link and add a if statement from this link ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/3084254/1526023 ) 
 
 
 Using 'now()' as default value automatically generates time-stamp.
