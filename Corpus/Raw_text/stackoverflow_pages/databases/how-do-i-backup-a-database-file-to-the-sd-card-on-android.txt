*** how-do-i-backup-a-database-file-to-the-sd-card-on-android ***

 I'd like to add a feature to my Android app that automatically backs up the  SQLite  database to the  SD card . 
 What's the best way to go about this? Are any examples or tutorials available? 
 
 SQLite databases are completely self-contained files and are portable â€” you can just copy the entire file straight to the SD card. 
 Though first I'd check whether an SD card is installed in the device, and what its path is (using  ). 
 
 This code works for me! 
 
 Does anyone know if this will work on non-root phones? I have only tried it on a rooted G1. 
 
 
 That works as opposed to the above examples in which the "/" are "\" wasted 20 minutes of my life figuring that out, but I really should have seen that sooner. The   will tell you where the file has been place or tell you what's wrong when it doesn't work. 
 
 I  answered  a question similar to this with a method you can place in your  .  It is as simple as copying the db file from some kind of external storage, to the internal application storage.  There is also some extra code that opens and reads the db file to make sure it is in the proper state for Android to make database calls to it. 
 
 
 
 You have to give the permission   in your application. It works fine on unrooted devices. 
 
 I don't know what happens if the phone is rooted or not but you should write your files to: 
 
 This will work whether it's rooted or not. 
 
 You find your Database Name in the Database Adapter if you are new into this. 
 Note that you can do this for SharedPreferences too but keep in mind to change your Context.MODE_PRIVATE to Context.MODE_MULTI_PROCESS. 
 SharedPreferences_name should look like this =  
 
 For export 
 
 For import 
 
 
 @skeniver's code  works for me. I just want to add the following: 
 Use: 
 
 It will give you your database path. It is better to use that instead of hardcoding the path, like:
