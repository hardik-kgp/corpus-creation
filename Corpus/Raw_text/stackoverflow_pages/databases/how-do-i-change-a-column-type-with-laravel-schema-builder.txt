 I need to change two fields from integer to foreign key. How do I build my migration to do so? 
 
 I'll change   to  ,   to   and   to  . 
 
 Don't think too much about it, I'm using following code. Here I change the data type from varchar to text. 
 
 
 I came across a similar problem needing to change a column type from string to integer. I managed this using two separate migrations (with a RAW sql statement in each) to get the solution. 
 In addition this works with Postgres and MySQL because we were in the middle of a transfer. 
 **The first migration:**

 
 **The second migration:**

 
 Thinking on this now it could be simplified to a single migration. 
 
 If you want to change the column type or modifying length etc, just call the   method 
 
 and to rename the column 
 
 
 I've just come across the same issue and the quickest solution is to simply change the column structure on the database and then also alter the original migration to reflect the change made on the DB.  
 This way if the migration is ever rolled back and then up again the correct fields will be created. I can't see any downside to this as long as you make sure to accurately alter the migration. 
 
 I had a similar issue trying to change column type from text to binary. I was getting an error when trying to run the migrate command.
I ended up solving it this way: 
 
 
 You can try to rename column to something temporary with   then create new column with standard creation line for foreign key, and finally copy data from  temporary column to the new one with controller function. 
Should work, but I didnt try it, didnt have a need. 
 
 I would just drop it and then re-add it as a different type. 
 
 In Laravel 5, you can use a closure such as below. That should do it in a database-agnostic way, so no need to have if-statements checking for database types. 
 (Note that you may need to  **composer require doctrine/dbal**
 to do this.) 
 
 
 you can change column name by using change() function.here i have mentioned one schema table  as a example
