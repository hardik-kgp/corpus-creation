*** how-do-i-change-a-mysql-table-to-utf-8 ***

 I know there are many settings for a language for a table and a database. 
 I already created the database.  I believe when I created it, it was default/LATIN.  I want to change everything-I mean... **both the table and the database, to UTF-8**
.   
 How can I do that? thanks. 
 
 
 
 Have a look at  Using alter command to change character set . 
 Another useful link:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-table.html 
 The general form is 
 
 and for a specific column in a table

 aioobe's answer tells how to change the character set of a database, table or column. You should keep in mind that 
 
 setting the character set for a table just specifies the default character set for new columns in that table. It doesn't change the character set for preexisting columns; you have to do those columns individually, OR if you want to change every single string-type column in the table to the same character set there's a command you can use to do that: "alter table ... convert to character set" (  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html  ) 
 if you already have data that is stored mis-encoded in a column, then using "alter table ... modify" to change the column will not quite solve the problem. For example, if you're been storing UTF-8 data in a Latin1 column and you change the character set directly from Latin1 to UTF-8, it'll still be mis-encoded afterwards. This can be worked around by converting from Latin-1 to UTF-8 via binary. 
 
 
 1) Database default character set and collation: 
 
 Altered via:  
 2) Table default character set and collation: 
 
 Altered via:  
 3) Column character set and collation: 
 
 Altered via:  
 The third one requires that you disable foreign key checks for the data conversion. So putting this all together:

 Add to your my.cnf this: 
 
 And restart mysqld deamon.
