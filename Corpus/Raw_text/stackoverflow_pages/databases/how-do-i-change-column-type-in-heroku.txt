*** how-do-i-change-column-type-in-heroku ***

 I am trying to rake the db:migrations into my heorku instance and I get an error.  The FAQ described my error as below: 
 
 Cannot change column type 
 Example: PGError: ERROR: column
  “verified_at” cannot be cast to type
  “date” 
 Cause: PostgreSQL doesn’t know how to
  cast all the rows in that table to the
  specified type. Most likely it means
  you have an integer or a string in
  that column. 
 Solution: Inspect your records and
  make sure they can be converted to the
  new type. Sometimes it’s easier to
  just avoid using change_column,
  renaming/creating a new column
  instead. 
 
 How do I change this migration now.  This is the problem that I have.  For my Contacts table, I created the following: 
 
 In a later migration, I do the following: 
 
 This change_column appears to be the problem. 
 Should I...change by hand that migration?  Is there a way I can clean the data in my tables (I didn't know Heroku would recognize the data in the table because I'm doing a rake). 
 I obviously need to change this value and it is used throughout my application.  Thanks. 
 **This is what I am trying...thoughts?**

 
 
 Do the following: 
 
 rename the column A 
 create the new column B as date 
 move the data from A to B 
 remove A 
 
 In other words
