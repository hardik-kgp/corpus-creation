*** how-do-i-change-db-schema-to-dbo ***

 I imported a bunch of tables from an old sql server (2000) to my 2008 database.  All the imported tables are prefixed with my username, for example:  .  In the table   it lists   as the db schema.  When I write stored procedures I now have to include   in front of all the table names which is confusing. 
 How do I change all my tables to be dbo instead of jonathan?

 See  ALTER SCHEMA . 
 **Generalized Syntax:**
  
 
 
 You can run the following, which will generate a set of ALTER sCHEMA statements for all your talbes: 
 
 You then have to copy and run the statements in query analyzer. 
 Here's an older script that will do that for you, too, I think by changing the object owner. Haven't tried it on 2008, though. 
 
 Got it from  this site . 
 It also talks about doing the same for stored procs if you need to.

 I just posted this to a similar question:  In sql server 2005, how do I change the "schema" of a table without losing any data? 
 
 A  **slight**
 improvement to sAeid's excellent answer... 
 I added an exec to have this code self-execute, and I added a union at the top so that I could change the schema of both tables AND stored procedures: 
 
 I too had to restore a dbdump, and found that the schema wasn't dbo - I spent hours trying to get Sql Server management studio or visual studio data transfers to alter the destination schema...  I ended up just running this against the restored dump on the new server to get things the way I wanted. 
 
 You can batch change schemas of multiple database objects as described in this post:

 Way to do it for an individual thing: 
 alter schema dbo transfer jonathan.MovieData 
 
 I had a similar issue but my schema had a backslash in it. In this case, include the brackets around the schema.

 ALTER SCHEMA schema_name TRANSFER securable_name 
 
 Open SQL server as SA account and click on new query past the blow queries 
 than click on execute, it will rollback all owned schema back to SA account
