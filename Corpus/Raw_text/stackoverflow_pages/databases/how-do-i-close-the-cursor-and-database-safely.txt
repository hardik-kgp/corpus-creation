*** how-do-i-close-the-cursor-and-database-safely ***

 I've fetched the records from Database using Cursor. It's work perfect. But, I've some errors in Logcat while i'm using this code  
 
 My logcat is - 
 
 I refered something from  here . They told that use getReadableDatabase(). I'm using that method also. And, i've also use this method,  
 
 after that having error like -  
 
 After, also i've this errors in my Database. So anyone tell me How do I acquire the safety close for Cursor and Database after fetching the records.  
 
 **EDIT:**
 If you return a cursor that is already closed, you can't use it. Open the database before calling the method, then close the cursor and then the database after calling the method. 
 You can close the cursor after you're done with it like this: 
 
 Or if you're using the cursor from an activity, and need to requery (when the activity is restarted, stopped...) you can use this: 
 
 To close database (after closing the cursor, or if inside an activity in   preferably): 
 
 
 In your class which extends ContentProvider, if you are opening the database connection
and setting the helper as an instance variable in onCreate, you can close the
database connection in shutdown. 
 
 
 Better practice would be- open it in onResume() and close it in onPause().  
 
 every time when you call this method database will open in read mode you but you didn't close the database that's why getting this error. open just once like from onCreate() method and close in destroy() 
 while you can close the cursor after fetching the rows and when there is no more need for cursor then close and set to null 
 
 You can also refer to this  answer  (suggests where you should close cursors/db objects connections depending on the state of Activity) or  this one  (suggests how to close SQLiteDatabase object). No need to elaborate when it's already written once. Despite that, below is idea for the coding part.     
 
 
 Try passing SQLiteDatabase as a parameter to your fetchAll method:
