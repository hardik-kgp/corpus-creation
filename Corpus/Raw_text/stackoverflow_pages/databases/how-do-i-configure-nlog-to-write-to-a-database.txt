*** how-do-i-configure-nlog-to-write-to-a-database ***

 I'm trying to get NLog to write to a database, however with my current code it throws an exception when I attempt to debug, the exception is: The type initializer for 'NotifyIcon.Program' threw an exception. 
 my NLog configuration file code is below, as this seems to be causing the issue as it's the only code I've changed. 
 
 any and all help would be greatly appreciated =]
