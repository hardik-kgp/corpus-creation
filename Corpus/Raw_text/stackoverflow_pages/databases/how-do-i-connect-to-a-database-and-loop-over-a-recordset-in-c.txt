 What's the simplest way to connect and query a database for a set of records in C#? 
 
 @Goyuix -- that's excellent for something written from memory.
tested it here -- found the connection wasn't opened. Otherwise very nice. 
 
 
 Very roughly and from memory since I don't have code on this laptop: 
 
 
 That's definitely a good way to do it.  But you if you happen to be using a database that supports LINQ to SQL, it can be a lot more fun.  It can look something like this: 
 
 
 This is an alternative way (DataReader is faster than this one): 
 
 
 If you are intending on reading a large number of columns or records it's also worth caching the ordinals and accessing the strongly-typed methods, e.g. 
 
 
 If you are querying a SQL Server database (Version 7 and up) you should replace the OleDb classes with corresponding classes in the  System.Data.SqlClient  namespace ( SqlConnection ,  SqlCommand  and  SqlDataReader ) as those classes have been optimized to work with SQL Server. 
 Another thing to note is that you should 'never' select all as this might lead to unexpected results later on if you add or remove columns to this table. 
 
 I guess, you can try entity framework. 
 
 
 Charge the libraries
