 Im trying to conennect to an sql database that its already created an that its located on a server. How can I connect to this database using python. Ive tried using java but I cant seem to get working either. 
 
 Well depending on what sql database you are using you can pip install pymssql for microsoft sql (mssql), psycopg2 for postgres (psql) or mysqldb for mysql databases
Here are a few examples of using it 
 Microsoft sql 
 
 Postgres 
 
 mysql
