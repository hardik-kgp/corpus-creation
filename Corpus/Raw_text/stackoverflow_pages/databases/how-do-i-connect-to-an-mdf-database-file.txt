*** how-do-i-connect-to-an-mdf-database-file ***

 I'm experimenting in connecting a C# app to an MDF database for the first time, and I need a little help .. 
 I made a small MDF database file in Visual Studio 2010, then created another project and imported the file into the project itself. 
 I am not trying to connect to the MDF file via code. Here the code I'm using: 
 
 When I run the application, I get an exception at the line where I define the connection string, and the exception has this message at the top of the stack: 
 
 Can someone point me in the right direction ? 
 
 Add space between  
 
 
 Go to server explorer > Your Database > Right Click > properties > ConnectionString and copy the connection string and past the copied to connectiongstring code :)  
 
 
 The filepath should have  **|DataDirectory|**
 which actually links to "current project directory\App_Data\" or "current project directory" and get the .mdf file.....Place the .mdf in either of these places and should work in visual studio 2010.And when you use the standalone application on production system, then the current path where the executable file is, should have the .mdf file. 
 
 For Visual Studio 2015 the connection string is: 
 
 
 
 
 
 this is working for me... Is there any way to short the path? like 
 
 
 Alternative solution, where you can have the database in the folder you want inside the solution. That worked for me:
