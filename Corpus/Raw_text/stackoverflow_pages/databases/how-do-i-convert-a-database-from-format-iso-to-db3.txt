 How do I export a database from  Isis  to  SQL ? 
 I can export the database from Isis to iso. I believe that I could convert iso to  dBase 3  and then  dBase 3  to  SQL , but I haven't found a way to do this yet.  
 
 1) Use one of the following two lines - the 2nd (MODE) if you have repeatable subfields: 
 
 2) Save this format and use it to print to a file through the standard PRINT option (Menu database -> print) 
 3) Choose “Output to: ASCII file (Windows)” and select the correct print format from the list. Then click “Print”. 
 4) Give a name to the TXT file and click OK. 
 5) Either: 
 A) Run MS Excel and open the TXT file. Then  import the data from Excel to SQL Server , OR 
 B) Load the flat file  directly into SQL Server
