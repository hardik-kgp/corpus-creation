*** how-do-i-convert-a-latitude-longitude-pair-into-a-postgis-geography-type ***

 I'm trying to load a bunch of latitude/longitude pairs into a PostGIS geography type so as to be able to query by location.  
 In particular I have a table with float latitude and longitude columns and a   column. I would like to do 
 
 The documentation appears to suggest that the following should work: 
 
 It doesn't. I don't know what it's interpreting this point as meaning, but it only allows the longitude to lie between -90 and 90, so it's clearly not a longitude.  
 So, what do I do?  
 
 ...sigh. Stupidity on my part. Apparently the correct order is longitude, latitude. I was fooled into thinking that both coordinates had the same range (-180 to 180) so thought something more subtle was going on.  
 
 Here are some ways to make geography types: 
 
 Convert numeric   and   columns to a   geography type: 
 
 Convert a   geometry column ( SRID=4326 ) to a   geography type using a simple cast: 
 
 Transform a projected   geometry column to a   geography type: 
 
 
 Note that the last two examples work on any geometry type. Also, the conversion from geometry to geography is often implicit, and these examples work without  , however explicit casts are usually a good practice for these things. 
 
 To perform exchange between lat and lng you may use: 
 
 with or without srid.
