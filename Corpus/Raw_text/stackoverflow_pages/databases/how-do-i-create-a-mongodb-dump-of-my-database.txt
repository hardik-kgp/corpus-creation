 To dump your database for backup you call this command on your terminal  
 
 To import your backup file to mongodb you can use the following command on your terminal 
 
 
 You can also use   for taking backup of one collection and compressing the backup on the fly: 
 
 or with a date in the file name: 
 
 **Update:**

Backup all collections of a database in a date folder. The files are gziped: 
 
 Or for a single archive: 
 
 Or when mongodb is running inside docker: 
 
 
 This command will make a dump of given database in json and bson format. 
 
 
 There is a utility called : mongodump 
On the mongo command line you can type : 
 
 The above will create a dump of all the databases on your localhost. To make dump of a single collection use: 
 
 Have a look at :  mongodump 
 
 You need to open command prompt as an administrator in a folder where your Mongo is installed (in my case: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin).
If you want to dump your whole database, you can just use:  
 
 You also have posibilities to dump only certain collection(s), or to dump all but certain collection(s).  
 If you want to dump only one collection (for example users): 
 
 If you want to dump all but users collection: 
 
 It is also possible to output the dump to an archive file: 
 
 
 Backup/Restore Mongodb with timing.  
 **Backup:**

 
  argument for databse name 
  argument for path of output 
 **Restore:**

 
  argument for drop databse before restore 
 **Timing:**

 You can use  **crontab**
 for timing backup: 
 
 It opens with editor(e.g. nano) 
 
 backup every day at 03:03 AM 
 
 Depending on your MongoDB database sizes you may soon run out of disk
  space with too many backups. That's why it's also recommended to clean
  the old backups regularly or to compress them. For example, to delete
  all the backups older than 7 days you can use the following bash
  command: 
 
 
 delete all the backups older than 7 days 
 Good Luck.

 Below command will work to take dump of mongo db . 
 
 mongodump -d  -o  
 
 On Windows : try this one where c:\mongodump is dump file location ,
It will create metadata in json, and backup in bson format 
 
 C:\MongoDB\bin>mongodump -d  -o c:\mongodump 
 
 
 Or you can make backup script on Windows, remember to add Winrar to %PATH% 
 
 
 Mongo dump and restore with uri to local 
 mongodump --uri "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_OR_URL:PORT/DB_NAME" --collection COLLECTION_NAME -o LOCAL_URL 
 If you do not specify --colletion COLLECTION_NAME, it will dump entire DB. 
 
 take mongodb backup for particular db and delete 7 days old backup using bin        sh command :- 
 
 
 
 
 use  **"path"**
 for windows. Else it gives the error as:   **positional arguments not allowed**

 
 mongodump -h hostname -u dbusername -p dbpassword --db dbname --port portnumber --out /path/folder 
 mongodump -h hostname -u dbusername -p dbpassword --db dbname --port portnumber --out /path/folder.gz
