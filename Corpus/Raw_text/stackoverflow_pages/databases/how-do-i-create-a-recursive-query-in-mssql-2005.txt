 You can't do recursion in SQL without stored procedures. The way to solve this is using Nested Sets, they basically model a tree in SQL as a set. 
 Notice that this will require a change to the current data model or possibly figuring out how to create a view on the original model. 
 Postgresql example (using very few postgresql extensions, just SERIAL and ON COMMIT DROP, most RDBMSes will have similar functionality): 
 Setup: 
 
 Adding a child: 
 
 Display a trail from bottom to top: 
 
 Display the entire tree: 
 
 Select everything down from a certain element of the tree: 
 
 
 Unless I'm missing something, recursion isn't necessary...
