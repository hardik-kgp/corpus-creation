*** how-do-i-create-and-query-linked-database-servers-in-sql-server ***

 I need to do a join across two different database servers (IPs 10.0.0.50 and 10.0.0.51). What's the best way? 
 
 You need to use sp_linkedserver to create a linked server. 
 
 More information available on  MSDN . 
 
 The solution I found: 
 1) Run a  stored proc 
 
 2) Verify that the servers were linked (lists linked servers) 
 
 3) Run the query using the format 
 
 
 I know that the answers above are good, but wanted to share some details that I hope others will find helpful. Worth to mention is the user access part, which I think people will need help with. 
 **set up the link:**

 
 **set up the access for remote user, example below:**

 
 **see the linked servers and user logins:**

 
 
 
 **run the remote query:**

 
 **drop the linked server and the created login users (adm/pwd)**

 
 **resources:**

 sp_addlinkedserver 
 sp_dropserver 
 sp_addlinkedsrvlogin 
 sp_droplinkedsrvlogin 
 
 You can, as mentioned, use sp_addlinkedserver. However, you may also do this via Enterprise Manager (2000) or SQL Server Management Studio (2005). Under the "Security" node, there is a "Linked Servers" node, which you can use to add and configure Linked Servers. You can specify security settings, impersonation, etc.
