 This is my document: 
 
 What is the query to find all documents that do not have user 11 in "blocked"? 
 
 You can use  **$in**
 or  **$nin**
 for "not in"  
 Example ... 
 
 I put a bunch more examples here:  http://learnmongo.com/posts/being-part-of-the-in-crowd/ 
 
 Since you are comparing against a single value, your example actually doesn't need a NOT IN operation. This is because Mongo will apply its search criteria to every element of an array subdocument. You can use the NOT EQUALS operator, $ne, to get what you want as it takes the value that cannot turn up in the search: 
 
 However if you have many things that it cannot equal, that is when you  would use the NOT IN operator, which is $nin. It takes an array of values that cannot turn up in the search: 
 
 
 Try the following: 
 
 This worked for me. 
 
 See  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/nin/#op._S_nin 
 
 
 This query will
  select all documents in the inventory collection where the qty field
  value does not equal 5 nor 15. The selected documents will include
  those documents that do not contain the qty field. 
 If the field holds an array, then the $nin operator selects the
  documents whose field holds an array with no element equal to a value
  in the specified array (e.g. , , etc.).
