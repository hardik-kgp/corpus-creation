*** how-do-i-do-database-transactions-with-psycopg2-python-db-api ***

 Im fiddling with psycopg2 , and while there's a .commit() and .rollback() there's no .begin() or similar to start a transaction , or so it seems ?
I'd expect to be able to do  
 
 So, how do transactions work with psycopg2 ? 
How would I set/change the isolation level ? 
 
 Use  , assuming   is your connection object. As Federico wrote  here , the meaning of   is: 
 
 As documented  here ,   gives you symbolic constants for the purpose: 
 
 
 The   with python standard DB API is always implicit. When you start working with the database the driver issues a   and after any   or   another   is issued. A python DB API compliant with the specification should always work this way (not only the postgresql). 
 You can change this setting the isolation level to autocommit with   as pointed by Alex Martelli. 
 As Tebas said the begin is implicit but not executed until an SQL is executed, so if you don't execute any SQL, the session is not in a transaction. 
 
 I prefer to explicitly see where my transactions are :  
 
 cursor.execute("BEGIN") 
 cursor.execute("COMMIT")
