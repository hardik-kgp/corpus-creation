*** how-do-i-find-out-my-mysql-url-host-port-and-username ***

 I need to find my MySQL username. When I open the MySQL command line client, it only asks me for my password. I don't remember my username. And for connectivity with JDBC, I need the URL, host and port number. Where do I find all of these? 
 
 If you're already logged into the command line client try this: 
 
 It will output something similar to this: 
 
 In my example above, I was logged in as   from  . 
 To find port number and other interesting settings use this command: 
 
 
 If you want to know the  **port number of your local host on which Mysql**
 is running you can use this query on MySQL Command line client --

 If you want to know the  **username of your Mysql**

 For Example in my case :   is the host name of the box where my mysql is running. And it my local PC host name.   
 If it is romote box than you can ping that host directly if, If you are in network with that box you should be able to ping that host. 
 If it   in terminal to check the host name.
if it is windows you can see same value in    you can see ( i.e System Properties)
