*** how-do-i-fix-incorrect-syntax-near-go-errors-in-scripts-generated-with-microso ***

 I've been searching for a "definitive" solution to this for a couple of hours now and can't find out exactly what the problem is so am hoping someone can point me in the right direction. 
 I'm trying to create a script for a database (an MDF file DB) on a remote machine and use it to create the same database locally. I've got Visual Studio 2010 on both machines so used the Database Publishing Wizard to generate the script. 
 I next created a blank DB in Visual Studio locally (another MDF file DB) and selected to create a new query. I've pasted the copied script in but when I try and run it I get dozens of "incorrect syntax near GO" errors. I'm not sure how many in total as the alert pop-up goes off the bottom of my screen. It would seem to be a lot though. 
 I trimmed off all but the very top of the script and I still get the same errors with it. It now looks like this: 
 
 I still get the "incorrect syntax near GO" error with this. 
 Is there something inherently wrong with the scripts this tool generates or am I doing something wrong with it? 
 The remote DB is 2008 R2 and my local is just plain 2008, hence why I don't just copy the MDF file across. 
 If anyone has any suggestions, they would be most welcome. 
 
 From the docs: 
 
 GO is not a Transact-SQL statement; it
  is a command recognized by the sqlcmd
  and osql utilities and SQL Server
  Management Studio Code editor. 
 
 Either use such a tool to execute the script or omit the GO commands. 
 
 I ran into the same problem recently and found the right answer to it (I think). 
 If you create a query in some random editor other than SQL Server Management Studio Code editor at the end of a line you may get a  **CARRIAGE RETURN (\r)**
 character instead of a  **CARRIAGE RETURN + LINE FEED (\r\n)**
. And even if you hit the DEL key at the end of the line and then Enter it doesn't change.  
 Use Notepad++ to replace CR (\r) for CRLF (\r\n) - keep the order, it's important!
