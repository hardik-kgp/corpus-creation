*** how-do-i-get-the-id-of-multiple-inserted-rows-in-mysql ***

 I am inserting some words into a two-column table with this command: 
 
 
 How can I get the ID (Primary Key) of the row in which each word is inserted. I mean returning a value like "55,56,57" after executing  . Does MySQL have such a response? 
 The term column is  . If a term already exists, MySQL will not insert it. Is it possible to return the reference for this duplication (i.e. the ID of the row in which the term exists)? A response like "55, **12**
,56". 
 
 
 
 You get it via   or via having your framework/MySQL library (in whatever language) call  . 
 That won't work. There you have to query the IDs after inserting. 
 
 
 Why not just: 
 
 
 First, to get the id just inserted, you can make something like : 
 
 Care, this will work only after your last   query and it will return the  **first ID only**
 if you have a multiple insert! 
 Then, with the   option, I don't think that it is possible to get the lines that were not inserted. When you make an  , you just tell MySQL to ignore the lines that would have to create a duplicate entry. 
 If you don't put this option, the   will be stopped and you will have the line concerned by the duplication.
