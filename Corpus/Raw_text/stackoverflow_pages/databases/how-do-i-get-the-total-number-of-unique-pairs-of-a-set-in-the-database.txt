 4 items: 
 
 6 unique pairs possible: 
 
 What if I have 100 starting items? How many unique pairs are there? Is there a formula I can throw this into? 
 
 What you're looking for is  n choose k .  Basically: 
 
 For every pair of 100 items, you'd have 4,950  combinations  - provided order doesn't matter (AB and BA are considered a single combination) and you don't want to repeat (AA is not a valid pair). 
 
 TLDR; The formula is   where   is the number of items in the set. 
 **Explanation:**

 To find the number of unique pairs in a set, where the pairs are subject to the  commutative property   , you can calculate the  summation  of   where   is the number of items in the set. 
 The reasoning is as follows, say you have 4 items: 
 
 The number of items that can be paired with   is 3, or  : 
 
 It follows that the number of items that can be paired with   is   (because   has already been paired with  ): 
 
 and so on... 
 
 which is the same as 
 
 or 
 
 
 This is how you can approach these problems in general on your own: 
 The first of the pair can be picked in N (=100) ways. You don't want to pick this item again, so the second of the pair can be picked in N-1 (=99) ways. In total you can pick 2 items out of N in N(N-1) (= 100*99=9900) different ways. 
 But hold on, this way you count also different orderings: AB and BA are both counted. Since every pair is counted twice you have to divide N(N-1) by two (the number of ways that you can order a list of two items). The number of subsets of two that you can make with a set of N is then N(N-1)/2 (= 9900/2 = 4950). 
 
 I was solving this  algorithm  and get stuck with the pairs part.

 So to calculate the sum of series of numbers: 
 
 But you need to calculate this 
 
 So in order to get this you can use 
 
 that is equal to
