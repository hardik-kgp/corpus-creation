*** how-do-i-import-an-accdb-file-into-python-and-use-the-data ***

 I am trying to figure out a way to create a program that allows me to find the best combination of data based on several different factors.  
 I have a Microsoft Access file with creature data in it. Attack, Defense, Health, Required Battle skill to use and several other bits of info. 
 I am trying to import this .accdb (Access 2013) file and be able to access the stored data.  
 I am going to try to make a program that scans all the data and runs all possible combinations (sets of 5 creatures) to find the strongest combination of creatures for different required battle skills (ex: 100 battle skill would use creature 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 where 125 battle skill would use creature 3, 5, 6, 8, and 10) 
 The main thing I need help with first is being able to import the data base for easy access so I do not have to recreate the data in python and so I can use the same program for new access databases in the future.  
 I have installed  https://code.google.com/p/pypyodbc/  but can't seem to figure out how to get it to load an existing file. 
 **Edit**

 I tried to use the code from Gord's answer, modified to fit my info.  
 
 Was getting an error with the print line so added () around it.  
 I am now getting this error, similar to what I was getting in the past.  
 
 I looked through the pypyodbc.py file at the lines mentioned in the error code, but could not figure it out. I tried to remove the "r" from the beginning of r"Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)};" and tried a space between r and "Driver because I did not know what it was for, But got a different error.  
 **Edit**

 I checked my files as suggested. I believe I am running 64bit. I checked both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions. I have Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb) in the 64 bit but not in the 32 bit. I am using the 2013 version of Microsoft Visual Studios.

 Working now! 
 My final working code in case it helps anyone in the future.  
 
 
 Say you have a database file named "Database1.accdb" with a table named "Creatures" containing the following data: 
 
 A minimalist Python script to read the data via pypyodbc on a Windows machine would look something like this: 
 
 The resulting output is 
 
 **Edit**

 Note that to use the "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)" driver you need to have the Access Database Engine (a.k.a "ACE") installed on your machine. You can check whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Python by running the following script: 
 
 Armed with that information you can download and install the matching (32-bit or 64-bit) version of the Access Database Engine from here 
 Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable
