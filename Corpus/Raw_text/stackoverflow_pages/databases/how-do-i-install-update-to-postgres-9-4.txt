*** how-do-i-install-update-to-postgres-9-4 ***

 I just installeed Postgres, but it seems to have installed 9.3 and I'd like to start with 9.4 
 I simply did  **apt-get install postgresql**
 from a new  **Ubuntu 14.04.1**
 machine. 
 http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/   
 says you can do: 
 
 but when I try that I get:  
 
 Okay, so I try the section below where you add the PostgreSQL Apt Repository but that can't find anything either. 
 Is 9.4 not in the package managers yet? Am I doing something horribly wrong? 
 
 postgresql-9.4 is not available in  14.04 "Trusty" .  It was added in  14.10 "Utopic" .  It may be back ported in the future. 
 The directions on the  PostgreSQL Ubuntu Download page  are missing a command.   Their wiki guide  has the correct procedure.  You must run   before trying to install.  This will cause the system to read changes to the sources. 
 
 You can add it from the instructions in the page 
 http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/ 
 
 Create the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list, and add a line for the repository 
 
deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ trusty-pgdg main
 
 Import the repository signing key, and update the package lists 
 
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4
 
 
 
 If you're trying to install on Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty", you can follow these steps:  
 To check your version: 
 
 1) Create new apt repo file for postgres 
 
 2) Import repository signing key and update packages list 
 
 3) Install Postgres
