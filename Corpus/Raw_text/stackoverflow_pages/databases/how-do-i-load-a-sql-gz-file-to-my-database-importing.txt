*** how-do-i-load-a-sql-gz-file-to-my-database-importing ***

 is this right? 
 
 
 No, it isn't. The right way would be 
 
 Note there can be no space between the   and   if using the -p syntax, refer  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-command-options.html#option_mysql_password 
 
 Use the following command: 
 
 
 tar -xzf myfile.tar.gz  
 Check the extracted sql files using: ls 
 mysql -u root -p password database < myfile.sql 
 
 You have to follow below steps: 
 
 First check Mysql service should be running.  
 Then if you have    compressed file, decompress it first. 
 Then you    will find .sql file    after decompressing.  
 Then find    import data in    left corner in Mysql.     
 Select option    import from    self-contained    file and select
your .sql    file    and specify a new    schema name.  
 Then    click    on import data.  
 After    importing you    will see    your new schema       in
available schema    list.
