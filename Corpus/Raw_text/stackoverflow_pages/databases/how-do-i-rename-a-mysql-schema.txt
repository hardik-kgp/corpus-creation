 how does one rename a schema in MySQL   
 
 Is there a MySQL statement for renaming a schema? I know about  , but that statement "was found to be dangerous and was removed in MySQL 5.1.23" (as they mention in  here ). 
 I was also trying to do it using MySQL Workbench. I tried right clicking on the schema, and then alter schema. But they don't let you change its name in there. 
 So how do people rename databases? 
 
 If you're on the Model Overview page you get a tab with the schema. If you rightclick on that tab you get an option to "edit schema". From there you can rename the schema by adding a new name, then click outside the field. This goes for MySQL Workbench 5.2.30 CE 
 Edit: On the model overview it's under Physical Schemata
