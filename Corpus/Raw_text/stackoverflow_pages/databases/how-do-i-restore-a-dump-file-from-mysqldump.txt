*** how-do-i-restore-a-dump-file-from-mysqldump ***

 I was given a MySQL database file that I need to restore as a database on my Windows Server 2008 machine. 
 I tried using MySQL Administrator, but I got the following error: 
 
 The selected file was generated by
  mysqldump and cannot be restored by
  this application. 
 
 How do I get this working? 
 
 It should be as simple as running this:  
 
 If the dump is of a single database you may have to add a line at the top of the file: 
 
 If it was a dump of many databases, the use statements are already in there. 
 To run these commands, open up a command prompt (in Windows) and   to the directory where the   executable is (you may have to look around a bit for it, it'll depend on how you installed mysql, i.e. standalone or as part of a package like WAMP).  Once you're in that directory, you should be able to just type the command as I have it above. 
 
 If the database you want to restore doesn't already exist, you need to create it first. 
 On the command-line, if you're in the same directory that contains the dumped file, use these commands (with appropriate substitutions): 
 
 
 You simply need to run this: 
 
 If the dump contains multiple databases you should omit the database name: 
 
 To run these commands, open up a command prompt (in Windows) and   to the directory where the   executable is (you may have to look around a bit for it, it'll depend on how you installed mysql, i.e. standalone or as part of a package like WAMP). Once you're in that directory, you should be able to just type the command. 
 
 
 look  here - step 3 : this way you dont need the USE statement 
 
 When we make a dump file with  , what it contains is a big SQL script for recreating the databse contents. So we restore it by using starting up MySQLâ€™s command-line client: 
 
 (where   is our admin user name for MySQL), and once connected to the database we need commands to create the database and read the file in to it: 
 
 Details will vary according to which options were used when creating the dump file. 
 
 Run the command to enter into the DB   
 
 Enter the password for the user Then Create a New DB  
 
 And make exit.Afetr that.Run this Command 
 
 Then enter into the db and type 
 
 Thats it ........ Your dump will be restored from one DB to another DB 
 **Or else there is an Alternate way for dump restore**

 
 Then enter into the db and type 
 
 
 I got it to work following these stepsâ€¦ 
 
 Open MySQL Administrator and connect to server 
 Select "Catalogs" on the left 
 Right click in the lower-left box and choose "Create New Schema"

 Change directory to MySQL installation folder 
 Execute command: 
 
 â€¦where "root" is the name of the user, "dbn" is the database name, and "C:\dbn_20080912.dump" is the path/filename of the mysqldump .dump file

 You can try  SQLyog  'Execute SQL script' tool to import sql/dump files.  
 
 
 If you want to view the progress of the dump try this: 
 
 You'll of course need 'pv' installed. This command works only on *nix. 
 
 
 
 As a specific example of a previous answer: 
 I needed to restore a backup so I could import/migrate it into SQL Server.  I installed MySql only, but did not register it as a service or add it to my path as I don't have the need to keep it running.   
 I used windows explorer to put my dump file in C:\code\dump.sql.  Then opened MySql from the start menu item. Created the DB, then ran the source command with the full path like so: 
 
 
 Using a 200MB dump file created on Linux to restore on Windows w/ mysql 5.5 , I had more success with the 
 
 approach from the mysql prompt than with the 
 
 approach on the command line, that caused some Error 2006 "server has gone away" (on windows) 
 Weirdly, the service created during (mysql) install refers to a my.ini file that did not exist. I copied the "large" example file to my.ini 
which I already had modified with the advised increases.  
 My values are 
 
 
 You cannot use the Restore menu in MySQL Admin if the backup / dump wasn't created from there. It's worth a shot though. If you choose to "ignore errors" with the checkbox for that, it will say it completed successfully, although it clearly exits with only a fraction of rows imported...this is with a dump, mind you.

 You can also use the restore menu in MySQL Administrator. You just have to open the back-up file, and then click the restore button. 
 
 Assuming you already have the blank database created, you can also restore a database from the command line like this:

 You can run the drop and create commands in a query tab. 
 **Drop the Schema if it Currently Exists**

 
 **Create a New Schema**

 
 **Open Your Dump File**

 
 
 Click the  **Open an SQL script in a new query tab**
 icon and choose your db dump file. 
 Then Click  **Run SQL Script...**

 It will then let you preview the first lines of the SQL dump script. 
 You will then choose the  **Default Schema Name**

 Next choose the  **Default Character Set**
 utf8 is normally a safe bet, but you may be able to discern it from looking at the preview lines for something like  **character_set**
. 
 Click  **Run**

 Be patient for large DB restore scripts and watch as your drive space melts away! ðŸŽ‰
