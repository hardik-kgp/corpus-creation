*** how-do-i-restore-one-database-from-a-mysqldump-containing-multiple-databases ***

 I have a mysql dump with 5 databases and would like to know if there is a way to import just one of those (using mysqldump or other).  
 Suggestions appreciated. 
 
 You can pipe the dumped SQL through   and have it extract the database for you.  Something like: 
 
 The two   commands: 
 
 Only print the lines matching between the   lines (including both   lines), and 
 Delete the  last    line from the output since we don't want mysqld to create a second database. 
 
 If your dump does not contain the   lines, you can also match against the   lines. 
 
 You can use the mysql command line --one-database option. 
 
 Of course be careful when you do this. 
 You can also use a  mysql dumpsplitter .
