*** how-do-i-set-up-the-database-yml-file-in-rails ***

 I'm doing this tutorial (http://dmix.ca/2008/09/how-to-scrape-websites-in-ruby-on-rails-using-scrubyt/) and step 4 before I begin is to set up the database.yml file. Not sure what that means. Could someone please explain? 
 
 At first I would use  http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ .  
 And database.yml is place where you put setup for database your application use - username, password, host - for each database. With new application you dont need to change anything - simply use default sqlite setup. 
 
 The database.yml is the file where you set up all the information to connect to the database. It differs depending on the kind of DB you use. You can find more information about this in the  Rails Guide  or any tutorial explaining how to setup a rails project. 
 The information in the database.yml file is scoped by environment, allowing you to get a different setting for testing, development or production. It is important that you keep those distinct if you don't want the data you use for development deleted by mistake while running your test suite. 
 Regarding source control, you should not commit this file but instead create a template file for other developers (called  ). When deploying, the convention is to create this database.yml file in   directly on the server. 
 With SVN:  
 With Git: Add   to the .gitignore file or with  git-extra   
 
 ... and now, some examples: 
 **SQLite**

 
 **MYSQL**

 
 **MongoDB with MongoID (called mongoid.yml, but basically the same thing)**

 
 
 The   is a file that is created with new rails applications in   and defines the database configurations that your application will use in different environments.  Read this for details. 
 Example database.yml:
