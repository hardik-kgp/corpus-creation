*** how-do-i-to-insert-data-into-an-sql-table-using-c-sharp-as-well-as-implement-an ***

 Below is the code I am working with to try to insert data into my 'ArticlesTBL' table. I also want to upload an image file to mt computer. Previously I was working in Visual Studio just with the data controls within my .aspx file to insert data, so trying to do this in C# is new to me. Any help would really be appreciated. Thanks. 
 I am getting an error reading: Incorrect syntax near 'UploadedUserFiles'. 
 
 
 You should use parameters in your query to prevent attacks, like if someone entered    as one of the values.
