*** how-do-i-turn-mongodb-query-into-a-json ***

 
 In my Django/Python code, I can't return a JSON from a mongo query because of "ObjectID". The error says that "ObjectID" is not serializable. 
 What do I have to do?
A hacky way would be to loop through: 
 
 
 The  **json**
 module won't work due to things like the ObjectID.  
 Luckily  PyMongo  provides  json_util  which ... 
 
 ... allow[s] for specialized encoding and
  decoding of BSON documents into Mongo
  Extended JSON's Strict mode. This lets
  you encode / decode BSON documents to
  JSON even when they use special BSON
  types. 
 
 
 Here is a simple sample, using pymongo 2.2.1 
 
 
 It's pretty easy to write a custom serializer which copes with the ObjectIds. Django already includes one which handles decimals and dates, so you can extend that: 
 
 Now you can just tell   to use your custom serializer: 
 
 
 Something even simpler which works for me on Python 3.6 using
motor==1.1
pymongo==3.4.0
