 Suppose I have a model like this: 
 
 Can I create a dictionary, and then insert or update the model using it? 
 
 
 Here's an example of create using your dictionary d: 
 
 To update an existing model, you will need to use the QuerySet   method.  Assuming you know the   of the Book you want to update: 
 
 
 If you know you want to create it: 
 
 Assuming you need to check for an existing instance, you can find it with get or create: 
 
 As mentioned in another answer, you can also use the   function on the queryset manager, but i believe that will not send any signals out (which may not matter to you if you aren't using them). However, you probably shouldn't use it to alter a single object: 
 
 
 Use   for creating a new model. Loop through the dictionary and use   in order to update an existing model.

 Adding on top of other answers, here's a bit more secure version to prevent messing up with related fields: 
 
 It checks, that field you're trying to update is editable, is not primary key and is not one of related fields. 
 Example usage: 
 
 The luxury DRF serializers   and   methods have is that there is limited and validated set of fields, which is not the case for manual update.
