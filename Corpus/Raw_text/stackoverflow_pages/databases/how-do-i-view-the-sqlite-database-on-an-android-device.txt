 I have a set of data in an SQLite database. I need to view the database on a device. How do I do that? 
 I have checked in ddms mode. The data in file explorer is empty. 
 
 Here are step-by-step instructions (mostly taken from a combination of the other answers). This works even on devices that are not rooted. 
 
 Connect your device and launch the application in debug mode. 
 You may want to use   to see what the database filename is. 
 
 **Notice:**
   is your application package name. You can get it from the manifest file. 
 
 Copy the database file from your application folder to your SD card. 
 
 
 **Notice:**
 filename.sqlite is your database name you used when you created the database 
 
 Pull the database files to your machine: 
 
 
 This will copy the database from the SD card to the place where your ADB exist. 
 
 Install Firefox SQLite Manager:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/ 
 Open Firefox SQLite Manager (Tools->SQLite Manager) and open your database file from step 3 above. 
 Enjoy! 
 
 
 Taken from  here , you can try: 
 
 Facebook's open source  Stetho library   
 
 In build.gradle: 
 
 Initialize the library in the application object: 
 
 And you can view you database in Chrome from    
 
 Another option is  this plugin  (not free) 
 And the last one is this free/open source library to see db contents in the browser  https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/Android-Debug-Database 
 
 
 The best way I found so far is using the Android-Debug-Database tool. 
 Its incredibly simple to use and setup, just add the dependence and connect to the device database's interface via web. No need to root the phone or adding activities or whatsoever. Here are the steps: 
 **STEP 1**

 Add the following dependency to your app's Gradle file and run the application. 
 
 **STEP 2**

 Open your browser and visit your phone's IP address on port 8080. The URL should be like:  . You will be presented with the following: 
 NOTE: You can also always get the debug address URL from your code by calling the method  
 
 To get my phone's IP I currently use Ping Tools, but there are a lot of alternatives. 
 **STEP 3**

 That's it! 
 
 More details in the official documentation: 
 https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/Android-Debug-Database 
 
 The best way to view and manage your Android app database is to use the library  DatabaseManager_For_Android . 
 It's a single Java activity file; just add it to your source folder.
You can view the tables in your app database, update, delete, insert rows to you table. Everything from inside your app. 
 When the development is done remove the Java file from your src folder. That's it. 
 You can view the 5 minute demo,  Database Manager for Android SQLite Database  . 
 
 You can do this: 
 
 
 
 
 In the   prompt, type  . This will give you all the tables in the database.db file. 
 
 
 
 If you are using a real device, and it is not rooted, then it is not possible to see your database in  , because, due to some  security reason, that folder is locked in the Android system. And if you are using it in an emulator you will find it in  ,  **/data/data/your package name/databases/yourdatabse.db**
. 
 
 Try  **AndroidDBvieweR**
! 
 
 No need for your device to be ROOTED 
 No need to import the database file of the application 
 Few configurations and you are good to go! 
 
 
 
 I have been using  SQLite Database Browser  to see the content SQLite DB in Android development. You have to pull the database file from the device first, then open it in SQLite DB Browser. 
 
 Although this doesn't view the database on your device directly, I've published a simple shell script for dumping databases to your local machine: 
 
 https://github.com/Pixplicity/dbdump 
 
 It performs two distinct methods described here: 
 
 First, it tries to make the file accessible for other users, and attempting to pull it from the device. 
 If that fails, it streams the contents of the file over the terminal to the local machine. It performs an additional trick to remove   characters that some devices output to the shell. 
 
 From here you can use a variety of CLI or GUI SQLite applications, such as   or  , to browse the contents of the database. 
 
 Follow these steps  
 **1**
>Download the *.jar file from  here  . 
 **2**
>Put the *.jar file into the folder eclipse/dropins/ and Restart eclipse. 
 **3**
>In the top right of eclipse, click the DDMS icon. 
 **4**
>Select the proper emulator in the left panel. 
 **5**
In the File Explorer tab on the main panel, go to     /data/data/[YOUR.APP.NAMESPACE]/databases. 
 **6**
>Underneath the DDMS icon, there should be a new blue icon of a Database light up when you select your database. Click it and you will see a Questoid Sqlite Manager tab open up to view your data. 
 *Note: If the database doesn't light up, it may be because your database doesn't have a *.db file extension. Be sure your database is called [DATABASE_NAME].db 
 *Note: if you want to use a DB without .db-Extension: 
 -Download this Questoid SqLiteBrowser:  Download fro here . 
 -Unzip and put it into eclipse/dropins (not Plugins). 
 -Check this for more information

 try facebook Stetho. 
 Stetho is a debug bridge for Android applications, enabling the powerful Chrome Developer Tools and much more.

 **step 1**

 Copy this class in your package 
 **step 2**

  put the following code in your class which extends SQLiteOpenHelper. 
 
 **step 3**

  register in manifest 
 
 **step 4**

 
 
 This works with Android 6.0 (debuggable apps at least): 
 
 Then you simply can view the DB with  aSQLiteManager  for instance. 
 
 You can try  SQLiteOnWeb . It manages your SQLite database in the browser. 
 
 Hope this helps you 
 Using Terminal First point your location where andriod sdk is loacted  
 
 then check the list of devices attached Using 
 
 and then run this command to copy the file from device to your system 
 
 You can find the database file in this path  
 
 
 There is TKlerx's  Android SQLite browser for Eclipse , and it's fully functional alongside Android Studio. I'll recommend it, because it is immensely practical.  
 To install it on Device Monitor, just place the JAR file in  . 
 
 Using file explorer, you can locate your database file like this: 
 
 Then you can use any SQLite fronted to explore your database. I use the SQLite Manager Firefox addon. It's nice, small, and fast. 
 
 I found very simple library stetho to browse sqlite db of app in chrome,   see   
 
 First post ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/21151598/4244605 ) does not working for me.     
 I wrote own script for get DB file from device. Without root. Working OK. 
 
 Copy script to directory with adb (e.g.: ). 
 Device have to be connected to PC. 
 Use   for get name of databases. 
 
 Usage:   for get DB file to this (where script is executed) directory. 
 I recommend you set filename of DB as *.sqlite and open it with Firefox addon: SQLite Manager. 
 (It's a long time, when i have written something in Bash. You can edit this code.)
