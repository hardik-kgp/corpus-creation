 Is there a system stored procedure to get the version #? 
 
 Try  
 
 or for SQL Server 2000 and above the following is easier to parse :)

 SELECT @@VERSION 
 
 I know this is an older post but I updated the code found in the  link  (which is dead as of 2013-12-03) mentioned in the  answer  posted by  Matt Rogish : 
 
 
 For SQL Server 2000 and above, I prefer the following parsing of Joe's answer: 
 
 Gives results as follows: 
 
 Result   Server Version 
8.00     SQL 2000
9.00     SQL 2005
10.00    SQL 2008
10.50    SQL 2008R2
11.00    SQL 2012
12.00    SQL 2014
 
 Basic list of version numbers  here , or exhaustive list from Microsoft  here .

 The KB article linked in  Joe's post  is great for determining which service packs have been installed for any version.  Along those same lines,  this KB article  maps version numbers to specific hotfixes and cumulative updates, but it only applies to SQL05 SP2 and up. 
 
 Try this: 
 
 
 
 
 Getting only the major SQL Server version in a single select: 
 
 Returns   for SQL 2000,   for SQL 2005 and so on (tested up to 2012). 
 
 Try 
 
 For more information see:  Querying for version/edition info

 This code gracefully handles the extra spaces and tabs for various versions of SQL Server.
