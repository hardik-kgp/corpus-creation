*** how-do-you-clone-duplicate-a-mongodb-object-in-a-collection-of-the-same-db ***

 I need to duplicate (clone) an object in the collection via dbshell. Having something like this : 
 
 where user1 select a complex object in  **users**
 collection, how can I duplicate the object then change (rename) user1 field in userX ? 
 
 **Code**
  
 
 **Description**

 You need to find user object and put it into the variable. Than you need to modify the property you want and than you need to insert the whole object as new one. To achieve that you need to delete   property that the object already has. And than just use   to create the new one. 
 
 Do not delete the   property; for some reason some values lose their  type . For example, integers are converted to doubles. 
 Use  this solution : 
 
 
 The _id field is a required field and we can't delete it like that. What I do is call toJSON() to the returned object and then delete the _id.
