 Suppose I want to use code like this: 
 
 How do you do this in SQL Server? 
 thank you! 
 
 
 Wrap the names in square brackets. 
 It is , however, best to avoid spaces in names if possible.  It just creates more work for you down the road... 
 
 
 This will work for table names as well, and is also a good practice if your field name is a reserved word or similar, such as   or  
 A better practice is to avoid those entirely... 
 
 I understand the need for creating columns with spaces in them, especially for reports that users will interact with, it's not very user-friendly to have a column heading labeled as 'Client_Response_Status_Code'. 
 Certainly the previous answers were all technically correct, however I would suggest rather than create columns with spaces in their names, create views and change the column names there instead... 
 For Example: 
 
 ... 
 This way you don't have to deal with those "friendly" column names everywhere in your code, but where you do need to use the friendly column names you can use the view instead... 
 
 Generally in sql you dont do it. you do response_status_code , if you have to use spaces i would try escaping them with \ or using [Response Status Code] or something  
 
 You can have columns with spaces, but it is usually avoided.  You need to wrap your column in brackets to select it:
