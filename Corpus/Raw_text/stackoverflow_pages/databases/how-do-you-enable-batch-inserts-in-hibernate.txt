*** how-do-you-enable-batch-inserts-in-hibernate ***

 I get the following output: 
 
 And then this: 
 
 never more than   basically. 
 Am I missing a setting? 
 
 To  enable batching for both INSERT and UPDATE statements , you need to sett all the following Hibernate properties: 
 
 If you can use a SEQUENCE, then you should not use IDENTITY generators, since  it disables batch fetching . 
 If you cannot use a SEQUENCE (e.g. MySQL), then try using a separate mechanism to enable batch inserts (e.g. jOOQ) instead of using the  TABLE generator which does not scale and has a high-performance penalty . 
 
 Turns out what was missing in this case was:

Or possibly hibernate.order_inserts. 
 Now I see 
 
 Much more frequently (anything greater than 1 basically means it's successfully doing batch inserts). 
 hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data may also be useful. 
 jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/batch?rewriteBatchedStatements=true type connection strings might also be related somehow.
