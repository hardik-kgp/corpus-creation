 How can I find out the URL and port for an Oracle database? 
 Example: 
 
 "jdbc:oracle:thin:@host:port:dbName","userName", "password"); 
 
 Is there an SQL command or log/configuration file I can look at? 
 
 With oracle, there is a   file which defines database addresses. This file is normally found in   and is used by oracle clients like sqlplus or Toad. Here is a sample tns entry: 
 
 From this entry you can work out that your jdbc connection string would be: 
 
 
 By reading the documentation which came along with the JDBC driver in question. 
 In case of the Oracle JDBC thin driver, you can find it  here . 
 
 **Specifying a Database URL, User Name, and Password**

 The following signature takes the URL, user name, and password as separate parameters: 
 
 Where the URL is of the form: 
 
 The following example connects user scott with password tiger to a database with INSTANCE_NAME orcl through port 1521 of host myhost, using the Thin driver. 
 
 If you want to use the default connection for an OCI driver, specify either: 
 
 or: 
 
 For all JDBC drivers, you can also specify the database with a Oracle Net keyword-value pair. The Oracle Net keyword-value pair substitutes for the TNSNAMES entry. The following example uses the same parameters as the preceding example, but in the keyword-value format: 
 
 or: 
 
 
 
 The URL is simply the server where it is running. 
 If it is running locally, it must be localhost:1521.
1521 is the default port of oracle databases.
