*** how-do-you-force-a-mysql-command-from-the-command-line-to-not-prompt-y-n ***

 I have a shell script that does the following 
 
 However, this brings up a prompt if you're sure you want to do that [Y/N]. I need this in a script so is there a way to force it execute?   option in documentation talks about not stopping for errors. 
 EDIT:   client in fact does not generate prompt. It turns out I had   client call that was generating the prompt. 
 
 It is evident that the shell script is waiting for the Y/N response and not the MySQL client. 
 You should be able to execute the line directly by just copying/pasting 
 
 at the Linux command prompt. 
 If you prefer, where this command appears, simply comment out the Y/N response from the shell script. 
 My next suggestion would be for you look into your my.cnf. 
 See if there is a   or   section with the following: 
 
 or 
 
 Those are real options: See  **safe-updates and i-am-a-dummy**
 in the MySQL Documentation

 My next guess would be the Operating System. Why ??? 
 If you are logged into Linux as   or you executed  , you have unquestioned rights to doing a  . At the OS level, mysqld would attempt to discard the folder for the database.  
 For example, if datadir is   and you execute  , mysqld will attempt to run  . 
 if you are not   or  'd as  , I would expect the OS to echo that message. In fact, I have seen a message from the OS ask to delete a PID file when I was not logged in as root and attempted  .

 **mysqladmin**
 does not cause prompting either, except for passwords. Here are all its options: 
 
 HEY, I STAND CORRECTED 
  does prompt for DROP DATABASE 
 OK I guess you located the culprit. I learned something today because I do not use   to drop databases. 
 
 Might have to pipe the 'yes' into the command.  This site  offers an idea on how to do this. 
 
 But here is another wrinkle via  this post . 
 
 
 In general, you can pass any query to mysql from shell with -e option. 
 
 Or you can Store your password in my.cnf but its less secure.
