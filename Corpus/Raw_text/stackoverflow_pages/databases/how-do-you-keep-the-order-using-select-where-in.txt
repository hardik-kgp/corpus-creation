*** how-do-you-keep-the-order-using-select-where-in ***

 Is there a way to keep the order when using SELECT WHERE IN()? For example, using the following query: 
 
 The results will come back using the default order by id. 1,7,54,55,56 
 When I want to keep the order used in the IN: 56,55,54,1,7 
 Is there a quick way to do this in mySQL or will I be forced to order it after in code.  
 Thanks :) 
 
 Use  FIND_IN_SET : 
 
 
 You can also use FIELD:

 You could do a UNION, that might return the order the same way.  
 BUT: 
 Why not just have your application reorder the results when it receives them, rather than forcing the DB to do it?
