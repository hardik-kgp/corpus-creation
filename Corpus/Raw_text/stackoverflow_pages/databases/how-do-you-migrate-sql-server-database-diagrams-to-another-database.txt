*** how-do-you-migrate-sql-server-database-diagrams-to-another-database ***

 My team recently rebuilt their SQL Server 2005 development database from scratch using the TFS source files. 
 Afterwards, we had a nice clean database that more closely matched our test and production environments. However, we also lost the database diagrams that had been created over the months in the old development database. 
 Does anyone know of a way to export a SQL Server 2005 database diagram from one database to another that contains the same tables and schema objects? 
 UPDATE: 
 Both Valentin and CMS's answers below should work just fine. I accepted Valentin's because it was first and I had already started using it. 
 I ended up creating a temp table called 'robsysdiagrams' and copied all the data into that and used the  Microsoft SQL Server Database Publishing Wizard  to script the data inserts out to disk. I then renamed robsysdiagrams to sysdiagrams in the script and ran it on the destination database. Everything worked fine. 
 
 Rob,
there is a table 'sysdiagrams' which holds the diagram definitions.
Try to create the table and insert the data from old database.
It should work.

 An old but elegant answer I came across while looking to solve the same issue:  
 To extract: 
 
 To import: 
 
 
 Assuming you have access to both databases within a SQL Server instance. 
 **Enable Diagrams in the new database:**

 In the new database click on the "Database Diagrams" folder. Sql Server Management Studio will prompt you to enble diagrams. If you Ok this step, you will have a sysdiagrams table in the database. 
 **Then execute the following:**

 
 
 You can  script  the diagrams  ( archive link ) to a .sql file... 
 
 I think this is the better way : 
 
 
 It's pretty easy, if you have a linked server or when you are still on the same machine: 
 
 
 My issue is that sometimes I need to drop my database and recreate it. I have a full generation script that creates everything except for the diagrams. 
 My workaround is to copy temporarily the diagram to another database, and after my database regeneration copy it back. 
 The funny thing is, one should NOT try to open the copy diagram, because the other database where it is located does not have the table structures of my database, so SQL server automatically upon opening clears all the tables in the diagram q-: 
 
 I did this using MSSMS's Export Data feature. 
 
 Right click on the database. 
 Choose Tasks > Export Data, which starts a wizard.  
 Set up both data sources. I used SQL Server Native Client 11, but others will probably work. Click next. 
 Choose Copy data from one or more tables or views (the default)  
 From the list, choose the sysdiagrams table.  
 Choose Edit Mappings. Make sure 'Enable identity insert' is checked. Hit ok. 
 Click next, then hit Finish to execute. 
 
 Worked like a charm.  
 
 You can directly copy as answered before. If you want to 'backup' only the diagram you can do that, see my answer on other question.
