*** how-do-you-query-for-is-not-null-in-mongo ***

 I would like to execute a following query: 
 
 What should be the correct syntax? 
 
 This will return all documents with a key called "IMAGE URL", but they may still have a null value. 
 
 This will return all documents with both a key called "IMAGE URL"  and  a non-null value. 
 
 Also, according to the docs, $exists currently can't use an index, but $ne can. 
 **Edit: Adding some examples due to interest in this answer**

 Given these inserts: 
 
 This will return all three documents: 
 
 This will return the first and second documents only: 
 
 This will return the first document only: 
 
 This will return the second and third documents only: 
 
 
 One liner is the best : 
 
 Here, 
 **mycollection**
 : place your desired collection name  
 **fieldname**
 : place your desired field name  
 Explaination : 
 **$exists**
 : When  is true, $exists matches the documents that contain the field, including documents where the field value is null. If  is false, the query returns only the documents that do not contain the field. 
 **$ne**
 selects the documents where the value of the field is not equal to the specified value. This includes documents that do not contain the field. 
 So in your provided case following query going to return all the documents with imageurl field exists and having not null value: 
 
 
 In pymongo you can use: 
 
 Because pymongo represents mongo "null" as python "None".  
 
   
 fetch documents that contain this filed_name even it is null. 
 **My proposition:**

 
 You can check on the required attribute's type, it will return all the documents that its field_name queried contains a value because you are checking on the filed's type else if it is null the type condition doesn't match so nothing will be returned. 
 **N.b**
:if the field_name has an empty string which means "", it will be returned.It is the same behavior for 
   
 **Extra validation:**

 Okay, so we are not finished yet we need an extra condition.

 This query worked for us (query executed from  MongoDB compass ): 
 
 
 
 
 An alternative that has not been mentioned, but that may be a more efficient option for some (won't work with NULL entries) is to use a  sparse index  (entries in the index only exist when there is something in the field).  Here is a sample data set: 
 
 Now, create the sparse index on imageUrl field: 
 
 Now, there is always a chance (and in particular with a small data set like my sample) that rather than using an index, MongoDB will use a table scan, even for a potential covered index query.  As it turns out that gives me an easy way to illustrate the difference here: 
 
 OK, so the extra documents with no   are being returned, just empty, not what we wanted.  Just to confirm why, do an explain: 
 
 So, yes, a   equals a table scan, it did not use the index. Let's force the query to use our sparse index with a  : 
 
 And there is the result we were looking for - only documents with the field populated are returned.  This also only uses the index (i.e. it is a covered index query), so only the index needs to be in memory to return the results. 
 This is a specialized use case and can't be used generally (see other answers for those options). In particular it should be noted that as things stand you cannot use   in this way (for my example it will return 6 not 4), so please only use when appropriate. 
 
 In ideal case, you would like to test for all three values, null, "" or empty(field doesnt exist in the record)      
 You can do the following.  
 
 
 the Query Will be  
 
 it will return all documents having "IMAGE URL" as a key ...........
