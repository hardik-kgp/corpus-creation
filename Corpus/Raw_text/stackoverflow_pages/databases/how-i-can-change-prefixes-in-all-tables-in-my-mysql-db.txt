*** how-i-can-change-prefixes-in-all-tables-in-my-mysql-db ***

 My provider installed to my site Drupal CMS. Now I need copy all my data from old site. I have tables without prefixes in my old DB, but in new DB all tables have   prefix. 
 
 zerkms solution didn't work for me. I had to specify the   database to be able to query the   table. 
 
 **Edit:**

 Optimized the query to only call RENAME TABLE once. Something I walked into was the fact that the concatenated output got truncated at 341 characters. This can be solved (if allowed by your server) by setting the MySQL variable   to a higher value: 
 
 
 write a script that will run RENAME TABLE for each table. 
 
 where "test" is expected database name 
 after this you can long query that will add prefixes if you execute it ;-) 
 
 PhpMyAdmin allows you to do this now. At the "Database" level select the Structure tab to see all the tables.  Click 'check all' (below the table listing). On the 'With selected' dropdown choose: 'Replace table prefix'. 
 
 You can simply dump the database, open the dump with a text editor, replace all occurrences of "CREATE TABLE "  with "CREATE TABLE dp_" and restore the database. It takes a couple of minutes to do. 
 
 If there's someone out there yet wondering how to do this (as it did not work form me the other options) you can run this (changing the first three variables for your values, of course): 
 
 And then you will be prompted with a bunch of queries needed in order to change all the tables in your database. You simply have to copy that, run it and voil√°!
