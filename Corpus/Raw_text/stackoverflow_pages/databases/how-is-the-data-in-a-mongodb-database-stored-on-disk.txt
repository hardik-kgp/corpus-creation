*** how-is-the-data-in-a-mongodb-database-stored-on-disk ***

 I know that   accepts and retrieves records as  , but how does it actually store these files on disk? Are they stored as a collection of individual   files or as one large file? I have a hunch as to the latter, since the   docs state that it works best on systems with  , which are better at handling large files. Can anyone confirm? 
 
 A given mongo database is broken up into a series of BSON files on disk, with increasing size up to 2GB.  BSON is its own format, built specifically for MongoDB. 
 These slides should answer all of your questions:

 MongoDB stores the data on the disk as BSON in your data path directory, which is usually  /data/db . There should be two files per collection there,  collection.0 , which stores the data (and that integer is then incremented as needs be) and  collection.ns  which stores the namespacing metadata for the collection. 
 
 Detailed documentation of the BSON format can be found here:  http://bsonspec.org/

If you turn on wiredtiger storage engine in MongoDB 3.0 it will use wiredtiger storage model
