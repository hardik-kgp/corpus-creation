*** how-should-i-structure-my-settings-table-with-mysql ***

 What's the best way to structure a MySQL table for storing admin settings? 
 Like this? 
 
 Or like this? 
 
 Or maybe some other way? 
 
 Table name = 'settings' 
 
 Then you can query like this: 
 
 This option is nice and easy and it will work well with 10, or 10,000 settings. With the other option you'll have to add a new column, which would be a completely pointless waste of time. 
 Edit 
 After your 1st comment you could choose multiple values like this: 
 
 :-) 
 
 Consider the first option ( ,  ) as columns. But also consider adding additional, meta columns as well, such as   (would come in handy if you have alot of ambiguous settings),  ,  ,  , etc. 
 
 Your first example, name-value pairs or EAV, allows for a good deal more flexibility. 
 Check out the  wiki page about EAV modelling in databases . 
 
 As usual, it depends. Solution 1 is simpler. Sol #2 easily integrates with ORMs, but may hit DB row size limitations.
Google for OTLT (as in One True Lookup Table problem)
How much settings do you have(few? dozens? hundreds?) How often will you need them?
