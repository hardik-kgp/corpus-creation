*** how-should-i-tackle-secure-file-priv-in-mysql ***

 I am learning MySQL and tried using a   clause. When I used it as below: 
 
 I got the following error: 
 
 The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement 
 
 How do I tackle this error? 
 I have checked  another question on the same error message , but still canâ€™t find a solution. 
 I am using MySQL 5.6 
 
 It's working as intended. Your MySQL server has been started with  --secure-file-priv  option which basically limits from which directories you can load files using  . 
 You may use   to see the directory that has been configured.  
 You have two options: 
 
 Move your file to the directory specified by  . 
 Disable  . This must be removed from startup and cannot be modified dynamically. To do this check your MySQL start up parameters (depending on platform) and my.ini. 
 
 
 I had the same issue. I finally solved using the   option in the command 
 
 You can find more info here  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html 
 
 If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the
  client host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full
  path name to specify its exact location. If given as a relative path
  name, the name is interpreted relative to the directory in which the
  client program was started. 
 
 
 On Ubuntu 14 and Mysql 5.5.53 this setting seems to be enabled by default. To disable it you need to add   to your my.cnf file under the mysqld config group. eg:- 
 
 
 I'm working on MySQL5.7.11 on Debian, the command that worked for me to see the directory is: 
 
 
 If the file is local to your machine use the  **LOCAL**
 in your command 
 
 
 Here is what worked for me in Windows 7 to disable   (Option #2 from  vhu's answer ): 
 
 Stop the MySQL server service by going into  . 
 Go to   (  was a hidden folder in my case). 
 Open the   file in Notepad. 
 Search for 'secure-file-priv'. 
 Comment the line out by adding '#' at the start of the line. For MySQL Server 5.7.16 and above, commenting won't work.  You have to set it to an empty string like this one -  
 Save the file. 
 Start the MySQL server service by going into  . 
 
 
 @vhu 
 I did the   and it returned   so when I plugged that in, it still didn't work. 
 When I went to the my.ini file directly I discovered that the path is formatted a bit differently:  
 Then when I ran it with that, it worked.  The only difference being the direction of the slashes. 
 
 I had the same problem with 'secure-file-priv'. Commenting in the .ini file didn't work and neither did moving file in directory specified by 'secure-file-priv'.  
 Finally, as dbc suggested, making 'secure-file-priv' equal to an empty string worked. So if anyone is stuck after trying answers above, hopefully doing this will help. 
 
 The thing that worked for me: 
 
 Put your file inside of the folder specified in  . 
 
 To find that type: 
 
 mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";   
 
 
 
 Check if you have  . 
 
 Do that typing: 
 
 mysql> show variables like "local_infile"; 
 
 If you get: 
 
 Then set it to one typing: 
 
 mysql> set global local_infile = 1; 
 
   
 
 Specify the full path for your file. In my case: 
 
 
 mysql> load data infile "C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/file.txt" into table test; 
 
 
 I had all sorts of problems with this. I was changing my.cnf and all sorts of crazy things that other versions of this problem tried to show. 
 What worked for me: 
 The error I was getting 
 
 I was able to fix it by opening /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server and changing the following line: 
 
 to 
 
 
 If you're running on Ubuntu, you may also need to configure Apparmor to allow MySQL to write to your folder, e.g. here's my configuration: 
 Add this line to file /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld : 
 
 Then add these 2 config lines to /etc/mysql/my.cnf sections: 
 
 Here's my SQL: 
 
 It worked for me. Good luck! 
 
 I had this problem on windows 10. "--secure-file-priv in MySQL" To solve this I did the following.  
 
 In windows search (bottom left) I typed "powershell".  
 Right clicked on powershell and ran as admin.   
 Navigated to the server bin file. (C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin);  
 Typed ./mysqld 
 Hit "enter" 
 
 The server started up as expected.  
 
 MySQL use this system variable to control where you can import you files 
 
 So problem is how to change system variables such as  . 
 
 shutdown  
 
 
 now you may see like this: 
 
 
 For mysql 8.0 version you can do this: 
 
 mysql.server stop 
 mysql.server start --secure-file-priv='' 
 
 It worked for me on Mac High Sierra
