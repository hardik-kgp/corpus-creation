*** how-the-cdc-retention-value-can-be-changed-for-the-cleanup-job ***

 I'm implementing a logging feature on a asp.net mvc2 application, that uses SqlServer2008 as a database and Entity Framework as a data model. 
 I enabled CDC feature of SqlServer and it's logging changes well, but I just noticed that some of the old logging data is erased. 
 Does anyone know what's default period CDC keeps records, and does anyone know how could I set it to indefinite value. 
 
 I just discovered that the default retention value is 4320 minutes = 72 hours = 3 days. 
 It should be configurable by using 
 
 
 The maximum value is 52494800 (100 years). If specified, the value must be a positive integer. Retention is valid only for cleanup jobs. 
 
 Here's the  link to the more detail explanation  of sp_cdc_change_job procedure 
 Hope this will help someone else, too :D. 
 
 If you want to retain the CDC data indefinitly, you can simply  disable the CDC cleanup job : 
 
 Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your database server 
 In the object explorer, expand “<instance> | SQL Server Agent | Jobs” 
 Find the job for cleanup named “cdc.<database name>_cleanup”. 
 Right-click the job and select "disable" 
 
 Here is a sample picture of where to find the option: 
 
 After you disabled the cleanup job, the CDC data will no longer get removed after a certain time interval. 
 
 By default it deletes anything older than 3 days, to change the default value to 14 days  use the following script
