*** how-to-access-ssis-package-variables-inside-script-component ***

 How can I access variables inside my C# code which I've used in Data Flow -> Script Component - > My c# Script with my SSIS package? 
 I have tried with which is also not working 
 
 
 Accessing package variables in a Script  **Component**
 (of a Data Flow Task) is not the same as accessing package variables in a Script  **Task**
. For a Script Component, you first need to open the  Script Transformation Editor  (right-click on the component and select "Edit..."). In the Custom Properties section of the Script tab, you can enter (or select) the properties you want to make available to the script, either on a read-only or read-write basis:
 
Then, within the script itself, the variables will be available as strongly-typed properties of the Variables object: 
 
 One important caveat: if you need to  **write**
 to a package variable, you can only do so in the PostExecute() method. 
 Regarding the code snippet: 
 
  is initialized to null and never set to a valid value. Thus,  **any**
 attempt to dereference it will fail. 
 
 First List the Variable that you want to use them in Script task at ReadOnlyVariables in the Script task editor and Edit the Script 
 To use your ReadOnlyVariables in script code  
 
 this line of code will treat the ssis package variable as a string. 
 
 I had the same problem as the OP except I remembered to declare the ReadOnlyVariables.  
 After some playing around, I discovered it was the name of my variable that was the issue. "File_Path" in SSIS somehow got converted to "FilePath". C# does not play nicely with underscores in variable names. 
 So to access the variable, I type 
 
 In the PreExecute() method of the Script Component. 
 
 
 On the front properties page of the variable script, amend the ReadOnlyVariables (or ReadWriteVariables) property and select the variables you are interested in.  This will enable the selected variables within the script task 
 Within code you will now have access to read the variable as  
 string myString = Variables.MyVariableName.ToString(); 
 
 
 Strongly typed var don't seem to be available, I have to do the following in order to get access to them: 
 
 
 This should work:  
 
 Your initial code lacks call of the GetVariables() method.
