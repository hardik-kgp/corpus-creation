*** how-to-add-auto-increment-to-column-in-mysql-database-using-phpmyadmin ***

 I've been trying to add auto-increment to one of my columns (basically an ID) but I can't find the auto-increment option for my column. Any idea where it is? 
 
 You can add it like this 
 
 
 To use the GUI: 
 Click the   tab to see the list of existing fields 
 To set a field as the  , click the gold key -- it will turn silver. 
 To set a field (usually the same field) as auto-increment: 
a. Click   for that field 
b. Look to the far right and checkmark the   box 
c. Click   button 
 
 A couple quick points based on recent experience: 
 
 To the original question, how to select auto-increment with phpmyadmin, it's the small AI check box on the change screen for a field name. 
 When I tried the "ALTER TABLE tablew_name CHANGE id id BIGINT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;" solution above, phpmyadmin gave me an error message saying the field had to have a key. I selected a Unique key and the error message went away and the field now auto increments. 
 
 
 This wont work if there are any foreign keys defined, and that is very likely for id fields. 
 use: 
 
 instead 
 
 The SQL script is correct 
 
 but if you try so make before in the visual mode, with the mysql version 4.7.4, in the struct of the table  
 Appear when you create the table one option to  say "A_I" , if you put your mouse appear message with AUTO_INCREMENT (The version of the foto is in Spanish version)
