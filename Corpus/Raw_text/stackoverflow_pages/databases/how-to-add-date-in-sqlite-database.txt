 How to add date value in this database?

 Now when you want to insert date to database, you can use this code. 
 
 In database insert the string 'date' 
 The date format in sqlite should be of following format:

 You cannot store date in SQLite directly. For example, you can store it as integer value: 
 
 In this case your date field must be declared as integer: 
 
 From SQLite docs: 
SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values: 
 
 **TEXT**
 as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"). 
 **REAL**
 as Julian
day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November
24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.  
 **INTEGER**

as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these
formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date
and time functions.

 The best way to put a date into a database would be using the long value of it. I tried to do what you were doing, and it had a similar error. Instead of a string, put in a numerical value. It can take the long value, which I believe is the millisecond value of some sort. It can then be reconverted when you pull it out.
