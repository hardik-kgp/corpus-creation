*** how-to-add-default-value-in-sqlite ***

 I had a table modified to add status column to it in this fashion 
 
 However SQLite doesnt seem to add N to the column for any new ITEM created. Is the syntax wrong or is there any issue with SQLite and its support for defaults. 
 I am using SQLite 3.6.22 
 
 Looks good to me.   Here are the Docs . 
 
 **Dump your schema and verify**
 that your table structure is there after calling ALTER TABLE but before the INSERT.  If it's in a transaction,  **make sure to COMMIT the transaction**
 before the insert.
