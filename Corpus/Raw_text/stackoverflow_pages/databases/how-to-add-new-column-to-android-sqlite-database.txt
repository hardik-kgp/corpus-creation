*** how-to-add-new-column-to-android-sqlite-database ***

 I have one problem with Android   database. 
 I have one table which contains one field.StudentFname
and that application is working fine with Android 2.3.1 and now if I add another field then my application is not working properly.  
 Can anyone help me who knows database very well, 
 
 you can use   function on your   method, like this: 
 
 Obviously, the SQLite will differ depending on the column definition. 
 
 I came across this thread when needing help on my own app, but saw issues with many of the answers. I would recommend doing the following: 
 
 You want to make sure the code will work when users upgrade more than 1 version and that the update statement only runs the one upgrade it is needed. For a bit more on this, check out this  blog . 
 
 The easiest way to do this is to add some   method in your  . Something like: 
 
 
 Perhaps a slightly more elegant approach using switch instead of if/then that will upgrade from any schema to the most recent schema... 
 Here's also a decent page on the syntax for altering a table:  http://alvinalexander.com/android/sqlite-alter-table-syntax-examples 
 
 
 @Aamirkhan.i think you would have solved the problem you mentioned in the comments long back ago.i think you didn't increase the data base version. or else the answers here are straight forward.i am writing this because it might help anyone who hasn't increased or changed their data base version number when they are altering a table. 
 
 I think we should not check condition like that 
 
 because if we use this , it means every time when we increase the database version then onUpdrade()  will call and condition will be true , so we should check like that   
 
 so in this case if old version is  2 then condition will be false and user with old version 2 will not update the database(which user wants only for version 1), because for those users database had already updated . 
 
 I have done the following approach, it is resovled for me 
 **if DB version : 6**

 
 **When you upgrade to : 7**
 ( I am adding 1 new column in the 3 tables) 
 
 Where : "DATABASE_ALTER_ADD_PAPER_PAID" is query. 
 
 After above two operation it will works fine for the fresh install user and app upgrade user 
 
 To add a new column to the table you need to use  . In android you can add the new column inside the  . 
 You may be wonder, how   will add the new column? 
 When you implementing a subclass of  , you need to call superclass constructor:   in your class constructor. There I have passed   for version. 
 When I changed the version   to above(  or greater),   will invoked. And perform the SQL modifications which I intend to do.
My class constructor after changed the version: 
 
 SQL modifications checks like this, superclass constructor compares the version of the stored SQLite db file with the version that I passed to  . If these(previous and now) version numbers are different   gets invoked. 
 Code should look like this: 
 
 
 Simply change in your code  
 
 private  final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1; 
 
 to  
 
 private static final int DATABASE_VERSION =2; 
 
 
 I came across link while searching for the same issue. It explains how to use upgrade. 
 https://thebhwgroup.com/blog/how-android-sqlite-onupgrade 
 it explains why to use this below code 
 
 
 The easiest way to create a new column on a table is add some SQL to the onUpgrade() method in SQLiteOpenHelper class. Like:
