*** how-to-add-new-schema-to-existing-visual-studio-database-project ***

 I'd like to add new schema (like dbo but with different name, ex. Fruit) to database. I'm using database project in Visual Studio 2013. I have an existing database project with tables, schemas, stored procedures, pre and post deployment scripts, etc. Database project is version controlled. I'd like generating publish scripts to work nicely as it did before I added a new schema. 
 Creating Fruit.schema.sql in  SchemaObjects/Database Level Objects/Security/Schemas  with content 
 
 will create schema but won't add Fruit schema folder sub tree in  Schema Objects/Schemas  folder like dbo schema has. Should I create that subtree manually? I suspect there is smarter way to achive this. 
 
 Yes, create the folder manually. There's no smarter way to do this :-) 
 
 In Visual Studio 2017, I can add item => search for schema, and that creates a sql file that includes the line:  . 
 Then, I can reference  that schema when creating other database objects. 
 
 I know this is pretty old, but I thought whoever is looking at this and scratching his/her head - how do I create all these folders automatically? can benefit from this link -  copy folders 
 so to create a new schema named "mh" you could do 
robocopy .\dbo .\mh /e /xf  .
