 You can only add one column at a time. Split it into two   statements and you should be fine. 
 
 
 The right way to add new column to DB, for example in version 2, would be: 
 
 It covers all pitfalls, including major issue: if a user goes from version 1 to 3 they will miss the upgrade query completely! These users will be in an awkward limbo where they are missing a few of the intermediate updates and do not have the expected sql schema. 
 Also don't forget to alter the create statement adding new column.
