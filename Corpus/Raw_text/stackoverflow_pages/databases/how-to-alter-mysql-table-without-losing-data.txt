*** how-to-alter-mysql-table-without-losing-data ***

 In my application, I make some changes and upload them to a testing server. Because I have no access to the server database I run   commands to make changes on it. 
 Using a method I ran the following command on server: 
 
 After that, I found that the  **all the data**
 of the table has been removed. Now the table is blank. 
 So I need to alter the table  **without**
 removing his data. Is there any way to do that? 
 
 Your question is quite obvious. You're adding a new column to the table, and setting it to  . 
To make things clearer, I will explain the reaction of the server when you run the command: 
 
 You add a new column, so  **every row**
 of the table has to set a value for that column. 
 As you don't declare any  default value , all the rows set   for this new column. 
 The server notices that the rows of the table have a   value on a column that doesn't allow  s. This is illegal. 
 To solve the conflict, the invalid rows are  **deleted**
. 
 
 There are some good fixes for this issue: 
 
 Set a  **default value**
 (recommended) for the column you're creating. 
 Create the column  **without**
 the  , set the appropiate values, and then make the column  . 
 
 
 You can create a temp table, pass all the information from the table you want to alter, and then return the info to the altered table.
