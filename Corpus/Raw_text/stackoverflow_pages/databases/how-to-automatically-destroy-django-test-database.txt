*** how-to-automatically-destroy-django-test-database ***

 I'm currently trying to automate django tests using hudson, and am struggling to find an option that will automatically destroy the test database if it already exists (typically it will ask for confirmation to destroy it, which the automatic testing obviously cannot provide for). 
 Any suggestions would be much appreciated! 
 Cheers,
R 
 
 Use --help to see the docs of the test command: 
 
 And use --noinput which defaults to destroying the test db;)
