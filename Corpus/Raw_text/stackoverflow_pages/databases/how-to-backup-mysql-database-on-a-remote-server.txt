*** how-to-backup-mysql-database-on-a-remote-server ***

 I have a MySQL database existing on a remote server. I only have  sql  connection privilege. I don't have FTP access to the server, and I need to do a complete dump of the database. I have tried  , but the issue is that it is creating the output on the server and as I don't have FTP I can not get the output from the server. 
 How can I do a clean backup and get the dump in my local machine(of course, the backup should be restored in my local machine)? 
 
 You can specify the server name as an option to  : 
 
 
 
 Normally the remote port of MySQL is 3306. Here is an example: 
 
 
 You can use the MySQL workbench  http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/ , which can backup directly to a local folder through a user-friendly interface 
 
 I use SQLyog for this where we can connect to the remote server and take a back up with this tool. 
 
 If the server admits PHP, you can upload and try  Adminer . I like it as a PHPMyAdmin replacer, and you can create backups with it! 
 
  locks tables by default, so other SQL actions are not possible during a dump. Without locking any tables, use the following syntax to backup a complete remote db and dump everything on your local machine: 
 
 Change   into your own username, change   into the remote ip address, and   to the actual database you want to backup. This will prompt you for your password. Once provided, the dump starts.
