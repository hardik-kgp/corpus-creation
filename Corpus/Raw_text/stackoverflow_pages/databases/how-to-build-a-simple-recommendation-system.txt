 How to build a simple recommendation system? I have seen some algorithms but it is so difficult to implement I wish their is practical description to implement the most simple algorithm? 
 i have these three tables 
 
 and 
 
 and 
 
 so I want to be able recommend items for each of the users depending on the items they purchased and other users' items 
 I knew it should something like calculating the similarites between users and then see their prosucts but how can be this done and stored in a database because this will require a table with something like this 
 
 so how can similarty beween users calculated?
and how could this complex data stored in ad database? (it requires a table with column for every user)?
thanks 
 
 How you want to actually store the recommendations is as a question completely unrelated to how one would actually implement a recommendation engine. I leave that to your database architecture. On to the recommending. 
 You said "simple", so a Pearson correlation coefficient might be the thing you need to read up on. 
 Calculating such a thing is dead simple.  Concept ,  example code . 
 
 Maybe reading  "Programming Collective Intelligence"  will help you.   
 
 The table can be stored in three columns 
 
 
 
 (I have no experience with determining correlation, though) 
 
 You most certainly do not need a column for each user.  You need a correlation matrix, that is true, but an actual database table is unnecessary.  Instead you can imiplement it as 
 
 
 I saw this in one of Joe Celko's books. I believe it's this one  Here . I don't have access to mine at the moment. Try heading over to a near by Barnes & Noble or Borders and check it out. I'll dig mine as soon as I have access and follow up.
