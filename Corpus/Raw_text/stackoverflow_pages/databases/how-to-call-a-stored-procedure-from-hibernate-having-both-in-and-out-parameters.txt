*** how-to-call-a-stored-procedure-from-hibernate-having-both-in-and-out-parameters ***

 I want to call a Stored Procedure from Hibernate which returns an out value. Here is my Stored Procedure. 
 
 I am trying this to call my procedure   
 
 I tried everything but no luck. Can you help me please?
If i try the above it says:  
 
 **Incorrect number of arguments for PROCEDURE myProcedure; expected 2, got 1**

 
 I tried to add an out parameter like 
 
 but then it says  
 
 **Not all named parameters have been set:**

 
 I don't know how out parameter will be set? Is it like the following? 
 
 Any help is appreciated :) 
 
 The easiest way to do that is return the out parameter as part of the returning parameters
(relevant only if you have access to the store procedures). 
jest add a store procedure like the following one 
 
 after done that it quite simple to use it with Hibernet in the following way 
 
 The result contains the out parameter,
if you want return multiply parameters you can add it by doing 
select @parm1,@parm2,... ,@parmn 
 
Hope it helped
