*** how-to-change-a-value-of-a-field-using-mysql-workbench ***

 I have installed  **MySQL Workbench**
 and I have the following problem. 
 I perform this simple select query: 
 
 that returns a list of rows. 
 So, in the output area, I select a field of a specific row and I try to change its value. But I can't do it.  
 Seems that is is impossible insert a new value for a specific field of a specific row. 
 Why? How can I use this tool to change a value? 
 Tnx 
 
 You can do easy with MySql Workbench this way : 
 in menu database simply connect  
 then  select the database you need and then the table.  
 Positioning the mouse over the table name  in table schemas explore  and so you can see on the rightside  a table icon.  
 Selecting/clicking this icon you can see the date in tabular form (like Toad).  
 With this tabular form you can edit and apply the change  
 Applying the change MySq Wworkbench show you the sql code and ask for confirm 
 
 Leif Neland's comment on @scaisEdge's answer is the real solution (as indicated by the huge comment-upvote count), so here it is as an answer, to increase its visibility: 
 Given that: 
 
 your query selects from just one table (no join) 
 the table has a unique primary key 
 your DB user has permission to UPDATE 
 
 Then, in the  Result Grid , you can edit a field by one of the following: 
 
 Click a field once to select it (the cursor changes into text cursor), and click a second time to start editing in-place in the Result Grid, or 
 Right click on a the field and select the "Open Value in Editor" option 
 
 After editing the value, you need to apply it: 
 
 The [apply] and [revert] buttons are at the lower right corner of the table.
