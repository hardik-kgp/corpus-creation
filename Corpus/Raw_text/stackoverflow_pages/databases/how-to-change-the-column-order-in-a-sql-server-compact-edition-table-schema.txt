*** how-to-change-the-column-order-in-a-sql-server-compact-edition-table-schema ***

 I'm using Visual Studio 2008 to design a  **SQL Server Compact Edition**
 database (*.sdf). I had to change the schema of one of my tables adding a new column.  
 I want to  **"move" that new column**
 from the bottom to a different position in the field list. How can I do this in the Visual Studio designer? 
 EDIT: I know that from a pure technical view point the order of the columns doesn't matter. I'm prototyping an application, so I have to change the schema a couple of times. If, for example I have to change the primary key, it would be "ugly" having the most important column at the end. Other developers looking at the code would be confused, I think. It's a matter of esthetics. 
 
 you can't just move it in the designer.  You'll have to create a new column, drop the old one, generate the script and edit the script where it inserts into the temp table from the old table, making the old column value (in the select) go into the new column. 
 
 I agree with Pax. If, for a specific reason, you need to return fields in a specific order in your query, just alter the query putting the field in the place where you need it. 
 If, for whatever reason, you need  **at all costs**
 to move that field, you can do it with a script like the following, which makes  FIELD3  the first column in a table called  TestTable : 
 
 However, I insist that probably your problem could be solved with a different approach which doesn't require restructuring table. 
 
 Follow these steps: 
 
 Remove all foreign keys and primary key of the original table 
 Rename the original table 
 Using CTAS create the original table in the order you want  
 Drop the old table. 
 Apply all constraints back to the original table
