*** how-to-change-the-default-port-of-mysql-from-3306-to-3360 ***

 I want to change the default port number of MySQL server presently it is 3306. I want to change it to 3360. 
 I have tried: 
 
 But things are not working for me. Please provide query to change port not any configuration. I am using Windows 8 64 bit.  
 
 You need to edit your   file and make sure you have the port set as in the following line: 
 
 Then restart your MySQL service and you should be good to go.  There is no query you can run to make this change because the   is not a dynamic variable (q.v.  here for MySQL documentation  showing a table of all system variables). 
 
 If you're on Windows, you may find the config file   it in this directory 
 
 You open this file in a text editor and look for this section: 
 
 Then you change the number of the port, save the file.
Find the service MYSQL57 under Task Manager > Services and restart it. 
 
 Go to installed mysql path and find bin folder,open my.ini and search 3306 after that change 3306 to 3360 
 
 Actually, you can just run the service using  , it would force mysql to run on the specified port without change the cnf/ini file.  
 I just cought a case that cnf didn't work. It was weired... so I just use the cmd line as the shortcut and it works! 
 
 When server first starts the   may not be created where everyone has stated.  I was able to find mine in   
 This location has the defaults for every setting.   
 
 
 The best way to do this is take backup of required database and reconfigure the server. 
 **Creating A Backup**

 The mysqldump command is used to create textfile “dumps” of databases managed by MySQL. These dumps are just files with all the SQL commands needed to recreate the database from scratch. The process is quick and easy. 
 If you want to back up a single database, you merely create the dump and send the output into a file, like so: 
 
 Multiple databases can be backed up at the same time: 
 
 In the code above, database_one is the name of the first database to be backed up, and database_two is the name of the second. 
 It is also simple to back up all of the databases on a server: 
 
 After taking the backup, remove mysql and reinstall it. After reinstalling with the desired port number. 
 **Restoring a Backup**

 Since the dump files are just SQL commands, you can restore the database backup by telling mysql to run the commands in it and put the data into the proper database. 
 
 In the code above, database_name is the name of the database you want to restore, and database_name.sql is the name of the backup file to be restored.. 
 If you are trying to restore a single database from dump of all the databases, you have to let mysql know like this: 
 
 
 In  **Windows 8.1 x64 bit**
 os, Currently I am using   version : 
 
 For changing your   port number, Go to installation directory, my installation directory is :  
 
 open the    Configuration Setting  file in any text editor. 
 search the line in the configuration file. 
 
 replace it with : 
 
 like my self changed to : 
 
 **To apply the changes don't forget to immediate either restart the MySQL Server or your OS**
. 
 Hope this would help many one. 
 
 On newer (for example 8.0.0) the simplest solution is (good choice for a scripted start-up for example):
