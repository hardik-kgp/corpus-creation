*** how-to-change-the-ownership-of-a-table-in-database ***

 I Have a database rndb and created a new table myname_record which is created with owner "postgres" by default. In my program i should have change the owner to "rndb" but i missed it. Now i need to do it in console so i am login with command  
 
 and then changing the owner with following query 
 
 but it is saying you must be owner to do this changes. I can understood because i am login through rndb it is giving this error. But how to make this changes actually. 
 
 Select a role with superuser permission and try to change the owner of your table. 
 
 
 You must connect as the  current  table owner, not the user you wish to change the table ownership to. Since that's  : 
 
 or  
 
 as required. 
 (Also, a superuser can always change table ownerships from anything to anything).
