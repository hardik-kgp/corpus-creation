*** how-to-check-if-mysql-database-exists ***

 Is it possible to check if a (MySQL) database exists after having made a connection. 
 I know how to check if a table exists in a DB, but I need to check if the DB exists. If not I have to call another piece of code to create it and populate it. 
 I know this all sounds somewhat inelegant - this is a quick and dirty app. 
 
 
 If you just need to know if a db exists so you won't get an error when you try to create it, simply use (From  here ): 
 
 
 A simple way to check if a database exists is: 
 
 If database with the name 'dbname' doesn't exist, you get an empty set. If it does exist, you get one row. 
 
 If you are looking for a php script see below. 
 
 
 From the shell like bash 
 
 
 Here is a bash function for checking if a database exists:
 
 
 Another alternative is to just try to use the database. Note that this checks permission as well: 
 
 
 A great way to check if a database exists in PHP is: 
 
 That is the method that I always use. 
 
 A very simple BASH-one-liner: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For those who use php with mysqli then this is my solution. I know the answer has already been answered, but I thought it would be helpful to have the answer as a mysqli prepared statement too. 
 
 
 Using bash: 
 
 
 Long winded and convoluted (but bear with me!), here is a class system I made to check if a DB exists and also to create the tables required: 
 
 In this you can replace the database name   with any database name you like and also change the creator script to anything at all and (hopefully!) it won't break it. If anyone can improve this, let me know! 
 **Note**

If you don't use Visual Studio with PHP tools, don't worry about the regions, they are they for code folding :P 
 
 Rails Code: 
 
 => entos_development exist , entos_development1 not exist 
 
 
 If you are using MSSQL instead of MySQL, see this  answer from a similar thread . 
 
 I am using simply the following query: 
 
 Then check if the result is FALSE.
Otherwise, there might be an access denied error, but I cannot know that.
So, in case of privileges involved, one can use: 
 
 as already mentioned earlier. 
 
 With this Script you can get Yes or No database exists, in case it does not exist it does not throw Exception. 
 
 
 Following solution worked for me:
