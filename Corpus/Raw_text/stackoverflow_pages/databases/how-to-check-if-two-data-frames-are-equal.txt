 Say I have large datasets in R and I just want to know whether two of them they are the same. I use this often when I'm experimenting different algorithms to achieve the same result. For example, say we have the following datasets: 
 
 So this is what I do to compare them: 
 
 Which works great when the datasets have no NAs: 
 
 But not so much when they have NAs: 
 
 In the example, it's easy to dismiss the   as not a problem since we know that both dataframes  are  equal. The problem is that   yields  , so whenever one of the datasets has an  , it doesn't matter what the other one has on that same position, the result is always going to be  . 
 So using   to compare datasets doesn't seem ideal to me.  **How can I better check if two data frames are identical?**

 P.S.: Note this is not a duplicate of  R - comparing several datasets ,  Comparing 2 datasets in R  or  Compare datasets in R 
 
 Look up all.equal. It has some riders but it might work for you. 
 
 
 As  Metrics  pointed out, one could also use   to compare the datasets. The difference between this approach and that of  Codoremifa  is that   will just yield   of  , depending whether the objects being compared are identical or not, whereas   will either return   or hints about the differences between the objects. For instance, consider the following: 
 
 Moreover, from what I've tested   seems to run much faster than  .
