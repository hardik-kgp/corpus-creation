*** how-to-compare-dates-in-datetime-fields-in-postgresql ***

 I have been facing a strange scenario when comparing between dates in postgresql(version 9.2.4 in windows). I have a column in my table say update_date with type 'timestamp without timezone'. Client can search over this field with only date (i.e: 2013-05-03) or date with time (i.e: 2013-05-03 12:20:00). This column has the value as timestamp for all rows currently and have the same date part(2013-05-03) but difference in time part. 
 When I'm comparing over this column, I'm getting different results. Like the followings: 
 
 My question is how can I make the first query possible to get results, I mean why the 3rd query is working but not the first one? 
 Can anybody help me with this? Thanks in advance. 
 
 @Nicolai is correct about casting and why the condition is false for any data.  i guess you prefer the first form because you want to avoid date manipulation on the input string, correct?  you don't need to be afraid: 
 
 
 When you compare   postgres casts values to the same type to compare values. So your '2013-05-03' was casted to '2013-05-03 00:00:00'.  
 So for update_date = '2013-05-03 14:45:00' your expression will be that: 
 
 This is always  
 To solve this problem cast update_date to  : 
 
 
 Use the   type. If the user enter a date: 
 
 If the user enters timestamps then you don't need the   part

 Use Date convert to compare with date:
