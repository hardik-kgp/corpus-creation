*** how-to-completely-dump-the-data-for-django-cms ***

 I have an instance of Django-CMS already running in a production environment.  I would like to dump all the data related to the CMS (PAGES and PLUGINS) so that I may load it back into my development environment.

 Your   command only dumps the data for the   app, but each plugin ( ,  , etc.) is its own app, and so needs to be added to the command line.
