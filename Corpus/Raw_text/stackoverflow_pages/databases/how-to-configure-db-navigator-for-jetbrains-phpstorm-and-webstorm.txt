*** how-to-configure-db-navigator-for-jetbrains-phpstorm-and-webstorm ***

 I need to set up a connection in the DB Navigator plugin for PHPStorm in a mac (snow leopard). It asks me for the route of a library that implements the java.sql.Driver class. I just don't have any idea of where is it. Any advice? 
 
 
 Instructions 
 
 
 Install DB Navigator Plugin via menubar >> Settings >> Plugins >>
Available-Tab 
 Download MySQL jdbc connector from here >>
 http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ 
 Unpack MySQL jdbc connector to a directory of your choice 
 Restart PHPStorm / WebStorm  
 Add a DB via menubar >> DB Navigator >> Settings >> Connection-Tab >> Plus-Button 
 Enter the parameters for your connection (see below for possible entries for a local MySQL DB) 
 
 
 Possible parameters for a local MySQL DB 
 
 
 Name: name of choice (localhost) 
 Description: additional info of choice (dbname) 
 Driver Library: path to the .jar file (that is the directory used in step 3) 
 Driver: preferred driver (most likely the standard driver will do >> com.mysql.jdbc.Driver) 
 URL: connection URL with a jdbc reference (e.g.:  **jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/**
) 
 UserName: db username of choice (root) 
 Password: db password of choice (root) 
 
 
 Just make sure you added  **jdbc:mysql://**
 before hostname. That solved my problem. 
 
 
 First of all, you don't need to install third-party DB Navigator plug-in, as database functionality is available in PhpStorm out of the box, see   |  . 
 Add new data source, it will allow to choose the database and the driver, and will download the required database drivers automatically. 
 
 Installed unpacked MySQL Connector J files here >
c:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Connector J 
 And there need to us >
mysql-connector-java-5.1.28-bin.jar 
 Copy to >
c:\Documents and Settings[YOUR_COMP].WebIde70\config\jdbc-drivers\ 
 In MySQL Database connection choose
Drivers >> MySQL >> click on PLUS and select 
 
 >
  c:\Documents and Settings[YOUR_COMP]\.WebIde70\config\jdbc-drivers\mysql-connector-java-5.1.28-bin.jar 
 
 Also need Database Support plug-in turn ON! (Settings >> IDE Settings >> Plugins) 
 p.s. Actually for PHPStorm 7 
 
 Download  **mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar**
 file and set Driver Library path for that jar file. 
 Then the Intellij idea will automatically load the Driver which is  **com.mysql.jdbc.Driver**
. 
 Then set URL as  **jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/**

 Finally enter valid user name and a password. 
 
 Clearly view this picture. I hope it may help you a little bit. 
 
 There is a driver files missing error at below of this image, click this  it will download required driver for you. 
 Database: your database name. 
 User : your database user name and password. 
 Then click test connection.I hope it will give you successful message.
