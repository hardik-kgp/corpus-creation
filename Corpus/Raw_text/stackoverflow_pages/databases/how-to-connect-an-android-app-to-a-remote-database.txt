 I've been doing my own research but to no avail. I am doing an android app which contains listviews and it needs to query data from a remote database. I would really appreciate it if someone could share good tutorial links that teach that kind of stuff. Sorry, I know this isn't a proper question but I really need some help. Thanks. 
 
 You can refer to this  tutorial 
 Or refer to this  
 
 To communicate with the remote databse, you require web service which can fetch data from or suit data to remote database. 
 I am not sure about which web platforms are you using currently but I would suggest you to go with REST with JSON. 
 
 How about a simple web service in the middle? 
 It helps to prevent you putting database username/pw directly in the app too. 
 App -> Http requests -> Web service -> Database 
 The Http requests can be done via Android  HttpClient 
 The web service can be in  php for example . (There is a lot example for php to database on google.) 
 
 This is the typical case of   with it you can use the remote database from your content provider as a regular DB. 
 I have done it and it works well with only few complexities.
