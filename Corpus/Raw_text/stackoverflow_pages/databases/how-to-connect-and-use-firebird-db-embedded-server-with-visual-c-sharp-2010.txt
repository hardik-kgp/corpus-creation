*** how-to-connect-and-use-firebird-db-embedded-server-with-visual-c-sharp-2010 ***

 I was trying to use Firebird embedded server with Microsoft Visual C# 2010.
so here is what I done till now: 
 
 Downloaded  **Firebird .Net Data Provider**
 ( Firebird Client v2.5.2 ). 
 Downloaded  **Firebird Embedded server**
 ( Firebird Embedded Server v2.5.0 ). 
 Added a  **reference to FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient.dll**
 to my project. 
 Extracted and Copied  **fbembed.dll file to my application's**
 directory. 
 Added my FDB file  **"TEST.FDB" to my application's**
 directory. 
 Added " **using FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient;**
" statement. 
 
 So far so good (I suppose)... 
 Now when I try to  **connect to my FDB file**
 using the following code: 
 
 I always get the messagebox which means the code is not connecting to my DB file properly.
am I doing something wrong? I'm really still noob with C# and I have no idea how to do this or fix it and I hope someone will help me with this. 
 thanks :) 
 EDIT: here is what I get in the exception: 
 
 FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient.FbException

  network request to host "127.0.0.1".

 I finally I found the solution after 6 hours of work :) 
 most of answers on google are either wrong or so old. 
all of them say that I only need to include fbembed.dll file to my project.. 
 after some investigations I made. I found that I also need to add  **firebird.msg, firebird.conf, icudt30.dll, icuin30.dll, icuuc30.dll and ib_util.dll**
 to  **my project**
 files and to the  **output folder**
.. 
 **important notice**
: never use compact .Net data provider. because they made it for Normal and super firebird servers only. it won't work with embedded servers. 
 
 With Firebird 2.5 embedded, I copy all this files to the application directory : 
 
 In the connection string, I specify that the server is embedded wih serverType=1: 
 
 I forgot also IDPLicense.txt and IPLicense.txt, I think we have to also distribute them with the application for license issue ? 
 
 I put the Firebird DLLs in a dir in the project called Firebird.   Added a Post Build event to copy the files.
