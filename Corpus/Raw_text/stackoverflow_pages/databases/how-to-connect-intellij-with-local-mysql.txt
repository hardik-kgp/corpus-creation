*** how-to-connect-intellij-with-local-mysql ***

 I have been struggling to learn how the localhost mysql and the intellij to connect and programme a database related task.Is that possible?if yes how it achieve? 
 
 Connecting to a local instance is essentially the same as connecting to a remote instance of MySQL. Just substitute either localhost, or 127.0.0.1 in place of the IP address you would use normally. 
 To add a new database connection (called a data source in IntelliJ), open the Database window  **View**
 ->  **Tool Windows**
 ->  **Databases**
, then click the  **+**
 sign and select  **Data Source**
 and then  **MySQL**
 from the sub-menu. The defaults for the MySQL connection should for a local install of MySQL. 
 To open a connection, right click on your new data source and select  **Open Console**
.

 As of Community version 2017.2, the DB Browser does not come bundled with the   (at least not on my last two installations). In order to activate it, you should navigate in the   in   and select   from the dropdown menu. From there you can install the Database Navigator. After the installation has been successful, you should restart the  . Then you can select  . 
 
 In recent versions of Idea Community (about 2017.3, but I am not sure) there is no Database tool available anymore, only in Idea Ultimate [1]. Yet worse, the plugin Database Navigator that would fit here to solve this problem is not compatible anymore, at least not with 2018.3 [2]. 
 Uninstalling Idea right now, unfortunately.

 if you want to add JDBC and connect other database vendor like workbench projects (instead of using intelliJ Consol) just follow the steps bellow :  
 **Using JDBC drivers #**

 Create a connection to a database with a JDBC driver #
If you cannot find a name of a database vendor in the list of data sources, download a JDBC driver for the database management system (DBMS), and create a connection in IntelliJ IDEA. With the JDBC driver, you can connect to DBMS and start working. 
 
 In the  **Database**
 tool window ( **View | Tool Windows | Database**
), click the  **Data Source Properties**
 icon. 
 In the  **Data Sources and Drivers**
 dialog, click the  **Add**

 Navigate to the JAR file of the JDBC driver, select it, and click
 **OK**
. 
 In the  **Class**
 field, specify the value that you want to use for the
driver. 
 Click  **Apply**
. 
 Return to the created data source connection. 
 Specify database connection details. Alternatively, paste the JDBC URL in the  **URL**
 field.
 To set an empty password, right-click the  **Password**

 To ensure that the connection to the data source is successful,
