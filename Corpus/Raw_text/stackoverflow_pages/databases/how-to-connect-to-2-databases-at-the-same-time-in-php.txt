*** how-to-connect-to-2-databases-at-the-same-time-in-php ***

 I am trying to connect to 2 databases on the same instance of MySQL from 1 PHP script. 
 At the moment the only way I've figured out is to connect to both databases with a different user for each. 
 I am using this in a migration script where I am grabbing data from the original database and inserting it into the new one, so I am looping through large lists of results. 
 Connecting to 1 database and then trying to initiate a second connection with the same user just changes the current database to the new one. 
 Any other ideas? 
 
 You'll need to pass a boolean true as the optional fourth argument to mysql_connect(). See  PHP's mysql_connect() documentation  for more info. 
 
 If your database user has access to both databases and they are on the same server, you can use one connection and just specify the database you want to work with before the table name. Example: 
 
 Depending on what you need to do, you might be able to do an   and save a bunch of processing time. 
 
 
 Lucas is correct. I assume that both the databases are hosted on the same host. 
 Alternatively, you can create only 1 db connection and keep swapping the databases as required. Here is pseudo code. 
 
 
 I would suggest using two connection handlers 
 
 
 If it's an option, use PDO: you can have as many database connections open as you like. 
 Plus, assuming your executing the same queries over and over, you can use prepared statements. 
 
 You can easily use 2 databases in same time with following Codes: 
 
 
 First Connect Two Database 
 
 Now Select The Database  
 
 Now if we want to run query then specify database Name at the end like,
