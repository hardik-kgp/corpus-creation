*** how-to-connect-to-amazon-rds-via-ssl ***

 I'm trying to set up an SSL connection to a MySQL database hosted via Amazon RDS. I'm confused as to how to connect. 
 According to Amazon's  documentation , I need to download a CA certificate called "rds-ca-2015-root.pem" and use it in my SSL connection.  **I set the database user that I am connecting with to require SSL.**

 In PHP, I include the code below to initiate the connection: 
 
 **However, no matter which path I specify as the third parameter in ssl_set() (even if the path is invalid), an SSL connection is successfully established. The third parameter just can't be set to NULL.**

 I verify this by running this query:  . The output verifies that the connection is encrypted (Ssl_cipher => AES256-SHA). 
 Could someone please explain to me how this works? I am confused as to why the connection continues to work successfully when the path is incorrect. How is the RDS server being verified? 
 
 The RDS documentation actually explains why this is happening, and suggests that you don't even need the CA cert: 
 
 Amazon RDS began updating the SSL certificates on all DB instances on
  March 23, 2015, but did not initiate a reboot of the instances. No
  operational impact or downtime is incurred when these updates are
  performed, and in many situations we will perform the update in your
  maintenance window. Amazon RDS will not update the certificate for
  your instances if you have already performed the update. Also note
  that Amazon RDS is not updating the certificates in AWS GovCloud (US)
  and the China (Beijing) regions. 
 Regardless of whether you manually update the certificate or Amazon
  RDS updated the certificate, the DB instance must be rebooted for the
  new certificate to take effect. You can decide when you want to
  manually reboot the DB instance, but you must update the certificate
  and reboot the instance before the old certificate (rds-ca-2010)
  expires on April 3, 2015. 
 You can check the certificate authority (CA) being used by your DB
  instance using the Amazon RDS console. The CA is listed under the
  Security and Network section of your DB instance details. If your
  instance shows rds-ca-2015, then the new certificate has been
  successfully applied. You still need to reboot your database instance
  and update your client application to use the new SSL certificate. 
 If the Amazon RDS console shows your instance CA as rds-ca-2010, then
  the new certificate has not been applied to your database instance
  yet. Use the instructions following to update the SSL certificate on
  your database instances. 
 
 The 3rd parameter is essentially being ignored by the client. I'm betting by setting the 3rd param to  , there is no point in calling   if all the params are null. 
 Try removing that function call altogether.
