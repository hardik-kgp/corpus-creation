*** how-to-connect-to-mysql-database ***

 I'm very new to C# programming but would like to be able to access MySQL Databases (do not have the money for MS SQL) 
 However I have one question; I know you are required to have "MySQL connector/NET" and "MySQL for Visual Studio" for developing the C# application, but does the person who installs the application also require them? (Is it possible I can just release the connector DLL with the program?) 
 Thanks 
 EDIT: Are both of them required for the end-user or just the connector? Is there anything else they would need? 
 
 Install Oracle's   NuGet package. 
 
 Example: 
 
 
 you can use Package Manager to add it as package and it is the easiest way to do. You don't need anything else to work with mysql database.  
 Or you can run below command in  Package Manager Console 
 
 **NUGET Mysql.Data**

 
 You must to download MySQLConnection NET from  here . 
 Then you need add   to MSVisualStudio like this: 
 
 Open menu project 
 Add  
 Reference 
 Browse to  
 Add MySql.Data.dll

 To use in the code you must import the library:

 Looking at the code below, I tried it and found:
Instead of writing   you should put   (That worked for me) 
 and instead of   you should put   (it's missing the d)
