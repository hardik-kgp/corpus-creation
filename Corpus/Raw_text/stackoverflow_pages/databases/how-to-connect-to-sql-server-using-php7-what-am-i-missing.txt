*** how-to-connect-to-sql-server-using-php7-what-am-i-missing ***

 Here's the phpinfo output:   version.php 
 Here's the code: 
 
 Nothing is written to the log file.  Even if I hard code text in the fwrite($myfile3, "hard coded text"); place, nothing is written out. 
 Here's the extensions section in the php.ini file 
 
 Lastly, I know I don't need all of these, but these are 4 dlls I have in the ext folder.

 First you need to isolate your problem - is this something wrong with your file writing or something wrong with connecting to SQL server, or something wrong with your PHP setup? 
 **Troubleshooting SQL Server**

 You may wish to use the   flag when calling   for as much detail as possible, and use a   or simply  /  the result to the screen (instead of writing to a file) so you can see if there's something wrong there - have a look at the examples on the   documentation page. 
 Next I would try to make sure that you're specifying the port correctly, e.g.: 
 
 Or specify the SQL Server instance, e.g.: 
 
 Also make sure that your user, password and database name are all correct, and that the user you've specified has the correct permissions on that database. And of course that it's running on port 1433 (or change the above to whatever port you have it running on). 
 After that, I would consider adding these properties  prior  to your   call to elevate as much as possible into errors coming back for troubleshooting the connection: 
 
 See if that turns up anything more useful from SQL server directly. 
 **Troubleshooting file-writing**

 
 you need to have a look at your   - you can use   mode instead of   to make sure that the file isn't truncated when you open it 
 You should also check to see whether or not the returned   is   as per  the documentation , in case the file open itself is failing. 

 
 If it is, then you may have a permissions problem in the directory that you're trying to create the file. If the file is already created ahead of time for you (no need to worry about creating it) you also may not have write permissions on that file. If the open is failing it should generate an   (which should display on the page since your   configuration is set to  , but you could also check the PHP error logfile). You can also use   and   to help check permissions.  
 When you say hard-coding a write value doesn't do any writes, this leads me to think that this is the actual problem. 
 
 I would also consider using different log files for each part (not   in both cases) 
 
 **Troubleshooting your PHP**

 Have a look at the  Microsoft documentation  to ensure that your DLLs match the right PHP7 dll you're using on your version of Windows, although that doesn't specify the Operating system requirements for v4.0 of the driver: they  may  not support Windows server 2008, although I would be surprised. They also don't show which versions of SQL server they support connecting to, so if you're on an old version of SQL server that might be a problem as well. 
 
 From the docs, this would give you more information:   http://php.net/manual/en/function.sqlsrv-connect.php   
 
 If that doesn't give you an error maybe you can't write to the file due to permissions? 
 
 As an alternative you could try to install   driver instead. This is an example for connecting to SQL-Server using Windows authentication.
