*** how-to-connect-to-two-databases-in-one-connection-string-in-c ***

 Normally, when I need to connect to a database using C#, I would use the following command routines below: 
- define a mysql connection. 
- open a mysql connection. 
- define a sql statement / query. 
- use MySqlCommand to execute the query.     
 Sample codes:   
 
 My problem above is on the part where I use the MySqlCommand command because it is where a database connection is indicated so that it will now which database to query to like   
 
 where sql is a sql statement and con is a connection to be used for the query. 
 How do I query two databases in one sql statement? 
Consider the following: (I'm using MySQL) 
 
 Or is there another way for this kind of problem?... 
 
 
 sql statement: 
 
 You can query multiple database at a time. 
 
 **Update**

 I think the only option is create 2 connections at the same time and pass the data between the 2 server through C#. 
 
 What you are looking for is the  Federated Storage Enginge 
 On one of the server (or even both), you can create a placeholder table that is transparently routed by the MySQL server to the other MySQL server. 
 It allows you to run your query on just one server and your server will contact the other server for the data it needs.
