*** how-to-convert-a-postgres-database-to-sqlite ***

 We're working on a website, and when we develop locally (one of us from Windows), we use sqlite3, but on the server (linux) we use postgres.  We'd like to be able to import the production database into our development process, so I'm wondering if there is a way to convert from a postgres database dump to something sqlite3 can understand (just feeding it the postgres's dumped SQL gave many, many errors).  Or would it be easier just to install postgres on windows?  Thanks. 
 
 There are some converter tools around:

 Probably, and doing so is very straightforward. 
 
 I found  this blog entry  which guides you to do these steps: 
 
 Create a dump of the PostgreSQL database.  
 
 Remove/modify the dump. 
 
 Remove the lines starting with  
 Remove the lines starting with  
 Replace true for ‘ ’ 
 Replace false for ‘ ’ 
 
 Add   as first line and   as last line 
 Recreate an empty development database.  
 Import the dump. 
 
 
 Of course connecting via ssh and creating a new db using rake are optional 
 
 STEP1: make a dump of your database structure and data 
 
 STEP2: delete everything except CREATE TABLES and INSERT statements out of myPgDump.sql (using text editor) 
 STEP3: initialize your SQLite database passing structure and data of your Postgres dump 
 
 STEP4: use your database ;) 
 
 In case one needs a more automatized solution, here's a head start: 
 
 
 It was VERY easy for me to do using the taps gem as described here:

 And I've started using the Postgres.app on my Mac (no install needed, drop the app in your Applications directory, although might have to add one line to your PATH envirnment variable as described in the documentation), with Induction.app as a GUI tool to view/query the database.
