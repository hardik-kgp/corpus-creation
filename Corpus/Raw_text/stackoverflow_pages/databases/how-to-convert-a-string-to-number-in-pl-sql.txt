*** how-to-convert-a-string-to-number-in-pl-sql ***

 I have 5 character string which can have numbers, decimal points, alphabets and spaces. I wanted to convert this string to a number (integer) if all the characters in string are numbers. i.e. 
 
 No decimal points allowed 
 No +/- sign allowed 
 Spaces are not allowed in between but they can be allowed at extremes 
 
 Thanks in advance. 
 
 Use  To_Number Function  in PL/SQL to convert a string into number, see below for example. 
 
 EDIT: 
 In PL/SQL you can check whether a string consists of numeric characters or not by using  LENGTH ,  TRIM  and  TRANSLATE  functions. 
 
 
  function converts a string to a number. 
 
 
 
 Did you try CAST(var AS NUMBER)? 
 
 Assuming you are working with a variable  
 
 breaking it down: 
 
 Trim leading and trailing spaces 
 Translate any internal spaces into an 'x' - think of the test case '1234 098' (i.e a simple string breaking the third condition) 
 translate any digits into spaces 
 Trim leading and trailing spaces 
 If everything was numeric you should be left with an empty string, which in Oracle terms is NULL 
 
 
 Also try this instead 
 
 Assume +1234.34 is the input
