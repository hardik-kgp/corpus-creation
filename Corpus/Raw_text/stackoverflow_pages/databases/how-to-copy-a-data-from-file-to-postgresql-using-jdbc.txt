*** how-to-copy-a-data-from-file-to-postgresql-using-jdbc ***

 I want to copy data from file to PostgreSQL DB using JDBC. I was using JDBC statement object to copy the file into DB. It is  very slow. 
 I came to know that we can also use copy out command to copy file to DB. But, how do i do with JDBC. Even good reference material having an example of copy in JDBC would help. 
 PS: thanks in advance 
 
 This works...
