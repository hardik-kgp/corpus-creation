*** how-to-copy-a-database-using-heidisql ***

 I have a local installation of MariaDB on a Windows XP. 
I created an empty database   which I wanted to populate with the tables of the database   which I exported as a dump-file from  a MySQL-instance (with HeidiSQL).  When I imported the dump-file db_x.sql into the the MariaDB instance: 
 
 I got the following: 
 
  remains empty and   from the dump-file was added (db_x is the database name of the original database I exported).  What I have to do to get the desired database name?  I thought I could change the database name in the db_x.sql file but I didn't want to open such a large file.  Can I change the import command above in such a way that it change the database name?  
I'm also interested in this kind of solution: 
 
 Is something like this possible? 
In the net I find the solution RENAME DATABASE which was not recommended and ALTER DATABASE db_x UPGRADE DATA DIRECTORY NAME
but sincerely, I preferred to create a new database with the new name.
Thanks for any help. 
 
 Consider you have two databases:   and  . If you want to  copy  the database contents from   to   you should do as follow in HeidiSQL: 
 
 Right click on   then select:  **Export database as SQL**
. 
 Now change the value of  Output  and select  **Database**
. 
 A select box will appear, select   and that's all. 
 
 
 
 There is an easy way to transfer a database from one instance to another with HeidiSQL: 
 
 Create the database db_y in instance y 
 Click on dump icon (or right click). The instance y should be activated. 
 At "Output" option choose Database 
 At "Database" option choose db_y 
 Select on the left the instance x and database x 
 Export 
 
 
 Try MySQL Workbench. It's made by MySQL and I've found it excellent for backing up a database and restoring it under a different name.

 HeidiSQL's export dialog recently got a new option called "Max INSERT size". This controls the number of rows in bulk/multiple INSERT commands. 
 Also, there is a  documentation  for this export dialog.
