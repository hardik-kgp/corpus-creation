*** how-to-copy-data-between-two-tables-in-sqlite ***

 I have two table with different column like this: 
 
 How can I copy data 'name', 'address' from table1 to table2. 
 And my question have two situation: 
 
 First: table1, table2 in the same database file 
 Second: table1 in data1.db file, table2 in data2.db file 
 
 
 Copying in SQL works like so: 
 
 If the values of the column   are the same, you need to insert and update 
 
 If you need to copy the columns between databases, you first export them into a file (use any format you like, for example CSV) and then merge that file into the second database manually since you can't write an SQL which says "use these sqlite structures".
