*** how-to-correctly-setup-a-database-yml-file-in-rails-4 ***

 I'm curious how to correctly set up my   file in a Rails 4 application. 
 It's not something I have really looked into in great detail as it all seems to just work when deploying to Heroku, but I want to understand it now and have noticed that the format has changed a little from Rails 4.0 to 4.1. For example 
 4.0.2 
 
 4.1.0 
 
 My questions are 
 
 Should I be setting usernames and passwords in ALL environments? 
 I'm using ClearDB on Heroku as my database. Should I be using   for production as the comments suggest? 
 
 
 The second database.yml you posted is actually equivalent to the first, it just copies values from the development block. 
 To answer your other questions: 
 1) Should I be setting usernames and passwords in ALL environments  
 you can if you wish, or you can leave it as you have above where it takes the credentials all from one block. 
 2)If I'm using clear DB with Heroku as my database then should I be uncommenting 
 heroku actually completely disregards this file (which shouldn't be checked into source control in the first place anyway). Heroku has its own mechanism to handle databases which you can read more about here:  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql 
 Essentially, treat "heroku's databases" and local databases that you define in this file completely different.
