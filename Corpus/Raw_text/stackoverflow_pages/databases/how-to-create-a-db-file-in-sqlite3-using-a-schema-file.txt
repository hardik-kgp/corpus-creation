*** how-to-create-a-db-file-in-sqlite3-using-a-schema-file ***

 Our client has provided us with a file named db.schema. Now is there a command which I can use to run this file to create a  **.db**
 file in sqlite3? Can I do this without having to type in all the queries mentioned in the db.schema file? 
 Please help!
Thanks!
