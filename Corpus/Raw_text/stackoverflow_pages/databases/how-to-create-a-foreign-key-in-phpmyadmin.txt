*** how-to-create-a-foreign-key-in-phpmyadmin ***

 I want to make doctorid a foreign key in my patient table. 
 So I have all of my tables created - the main problem is that when I go to the table > structure > relation view only the primary key comes up that I can create a foreign key (and it is already the primary key of the certain table that I want to keep - i.e Patient table patient is enabled to be changed but the doctor Id -I have a doctor table also- is not enabled). 
 I have another table with two composite keys (medicineid and patientid) in relation view it enables me to change both 
 Do I have to chance the index of doctor ID in patient table to something else? both cannot be primary keys as patient ID is the primary for the patient table - doctor is the foreign. 
 
 I hope anyone can help 
 Kind regards 
 
 You can do it the old fashioned way... with an SQL statement that looks something like this 
 
 This assumes the keys already exist in the relevant table 
 
 The key must be indexed to apply foreign key constraint. To do that follow the steps. 
 
 Open table structure. (2nd tab) 
 See the last column action where multiples action options are there. Click on  **Index**
, this will make the column indexed. 
 Open relation view and add foreign key constraint.  
 
 You will be able to assign  **DOCTOR_ID**
 as foreign now. 
 
 When you create table than you can give like follows. 
 
 and when after the table create like this 
 
 Following on example for it. 
 
 To add a foreign key to the products table, you use the following statement: 
 
 For drop the key 
 
 Hope this help to learn FOREIGN keys works 
 
 To be able to create a relation, the table  **Storage Engine**
 must be  InnoDB . You can edit in  Operations  tab.
 
 Then, you need to be sure that the  **id**
 column in your main table has been indexed. It should appear at  Index  section in  Structure  tab. 
 
 Finally, you could see the option  Relations View  in  Structure  tab. When edditing, you will be able to select the parent column in foreign table to create the relation. 
 
 See attachments. I hope this could be useful for anyone.
