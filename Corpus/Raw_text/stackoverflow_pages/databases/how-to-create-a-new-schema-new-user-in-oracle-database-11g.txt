*** how-to-create-a-new-schema-new-user-in-oracle-database-11g ***

 I have applied for an internship in a company and as a question they have asked me to create a schema for their company with certain requirements and mail them the  DDL  file. I have installed Oracle database 11g Express edition, but how do I create a new schema in Oracle database 11g? I have searched in the net for a solution but I could not understand what to do. And after creating a schema, which file should I mail them? 
 
 Generally speaking a schema in oracle is the same as an user. Oracle Database automatically creates a schema when you create a user. A file with the DDL file extension is an SQL Data Definition Language file. 
 **Creating new user (using SQL Plus)**

 Basic SQL Plus commands: 
 
 Open SQL Plus and log: 
 
 The sysdba is a role and is like "root" on unix or "Administrator" on Windows. It sees all, can do all. Internally, if you connect as sysdba, your schema name will appear to be SYS. 
 Create an user: 
 
 View all users and check if the user johny is there: 
 
 If you try to login as johny now you would get an error: 
 
 The user to login needs at least create session priviledge so we have to grant this privileges to the user: 
 
 Now you are able to connect as the user johny: 
 
 To get rid of the user you can drop it: 
 
 
 That was basic example to show how to create an user. It might be more complex. Above we created an user who's objects are stored in the database default tablespace. To have database tidy we should place users objects to his own space (tablespace is an allocation of space in the database that can contain schema objects). 
 Show already created tablespaces: 
 
 Create tablespace: 
 
 Create temporary tablespace (Temporaty tablespace is an allocation of space in the database that can contain transient data that persists only for the duration of a session. This transient data cannot be recovered after process or instance failure.): 
 
 Create the user: 
 
 Grant some privileges: 
 
 Login as johny and check what privileges he has: 
 
 With create table privilege the user can create tables: 
 
 Insert data: 
 
 Select: 
 
 To get DDL data you can use DBMS_METADATA package that "provides a way for you to retrieve metadata from the database dictionary as XML or creation DDL and to submit the XML to re-create the object.".

 SQL Plus commands

 It's a working example: 
 
 
 Let's get you started. Do you have any knowledge in Oracle? 
 First you need to understand what a SCHEMA is. 
A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. A schema is owned by a database user and has the same name as that user. Each user owns a single schema. Schema objects can be created and manipulated with SQL. 
 
 CREATE USER acoder; -- whenever you create a new user in Oracle, a schema with the same name as the username is created where all his objects are stored. 
 GRANT CREATE SESSION TO acoder; -- Failure to do this you cannot do anything. 
 
 To access another user's schema, you need to be granted privileges on specific object on that schema or optionally have SYSDBA role assigned. 
 That should get you started.  
 
 
 
 From oracle Sql developer, execute the below in sql worksheet: 
 
 then right click on "Oracle connection" -> new connection, then make everything lctest from connection name to user name password. Test connection shall pass. Then after connected you will see the schema.
