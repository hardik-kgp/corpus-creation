 You are using the  password validation plugin . By default it only allows 8 characters and longer passwords. Because it can't check the value of a hash, @RiggsFolly is correct that pre-hashing the password will work.

 file : 
 
 in  **[mysqld]**

 
 Save the file and then  **restart**
 the process

 It's possible to entirely disable the password "plugin" that seems overly strict by running the following:
 
 Should you need it again you can turn it back on via:
 
 Optionally, you could disable it, set your password and re-enable it:
