 How do you create a Microsoft Access database file in C# if it does not exist yet? 
 
 The simplest answer is to embed an empty   /   file in your program and write it out to disk. 
 The correct answer is to use COM Interop with the ADOX library: 
 
 Remember to generate your connection strings using  .

 On my computer, Windows 7 sp1 Professional 64-bit, I found Microsoft ADO Ext. 2.8 for DDL and Security in  C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ado\msadox28.dll . 
 It is also found as a reference: 
 
 which is included as  **ADOX**
 in the references 
 
 By default, columns are created as  **text[255]**
.  Here are a few examples to create columns as different datatypes. 
 
 I found this list of datatypes to create and read access database fields 
 
 Access Text = adVarWChar 
 Access Memo = adLongVarWChar 
 Access Numeric Byte = adUnsignedTinyInt 
 Access Numeric Integer = adSmallInt 
 Access Numeric Long Integer = adInteger 
 Access Numeric Single Precision = adSingle 
 Access Numeric Double Precision = adDouble 
 Access Numeric Replicatie-id = adGuid 
 Access Numeric Decimal = adNumeric 
 Access Date / Time = adDate 
 Access Currency = adCurrency 
 Access AutoNumber = adInteger 
 Access Yes / No = adBoolean 
 Access HyperLink = adLongVarWChar 
 
 
 You can use the  CreateDatabase  method in the DAO / ACE library (it's installed with Office, or available for download from  here ). 
 
 Note that depending on the version of Access/Jet you want your database to support, you can use other values from the   enum: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Also note that you can choose to encrypt the database, or select a different collation. 
 NB: If you have a 64-bit machine, and want to run the code as part of a 64-bit program, you'll need the 64-bit version of the engine. If you already have the 32-bit version installed (either via Office, or via the download), you'll have to run the 64-bit installer with the   and   flags; otherwise you'll get a message that you can't install 64-bit components over previously installed 32-bit components.
