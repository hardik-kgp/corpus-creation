*** how-to-create-procedure-in-h2 ***

 This seems to be a duplicate of the other question with the same title, but it actually isn't. 
 We have our business logic implemented mostly as DB2 stored procedures (I see that H2 has a DB2-compatibility mode - nice!). 
 How can we use H2 for in-memory unit testing with these procedures? 
 Unfortunately H2 seems to lack the CREATE PROCEDURE command from its  grammar .  
 I don't want to use Java functions as  stored procedures . It would be best if the very same sql files could be used for testing and production as well... am I asking too much? 
 EDIT: we also use SQL cursors... again, no sign of support :-( 
 
 Unfortunately, the compatibility mode doesn't go as far as supporting SQL prodecures. Currently, the only solution is to use Java functions. SQL cursors are also not supported, sorry. But I will add these feature requests to the roadmap. Patches are welcome of course :-)
