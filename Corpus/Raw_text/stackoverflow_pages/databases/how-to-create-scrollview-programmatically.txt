*** how-to-create-scrollview-programmatically ***

 I have one table "TABLE_SUBJECT" which contain a number of subjects. I need to create 
one horizontal scroll view with Subject. 
 How do I create a ScrollView with database items programmatically? If I enter 1o subject then it will be appear in scroll view as a button. Is it possible? 
 
 you may create it as below: 
 
 
 if you have many elements first you need to wrap-up and add in the Scroll view; for example i need a many text view inside of scrollview, so you need to create ScrollView->LinearLayout->Many textview 
 
 
 this may help you. 
 
 instead of for loop just modify the code as your need(no of records in db). but this the code for creating buttons in dynamically. 
 
 I was doing it like this: 
 
 Create xml with LinearLayout inside the ScrollView 
 Create xml as item in ScrollView 
 In activity set main content as xml with ScrollView 
 Loop through all table elements with adding new View to LinearLayout form main view 
 
 For me works fine.
