*** how-to-create-temporary-procedures-in-mysql ***

 I am currently working on a portal application for a restaurant. The backend database used is Mysql and I am using Spring JDBC support for writing data access logic.  
 Some of my DAOs are cluttered with multiple queries and are getting upto thousand lines of code in size. I think I can reduce the size and complexity by moving some of my logic into a SQL-PSM procedure (Since data binding and glue code in Java is an abomination from hell). 
 However I do not have DDL rights on the Db and hence cannot create the procedure. 
 I was wondering if there is a way to create a discard-able\temporary procedure that you can execute directly like a DML statement without having to create it first. 
 i.e. I want a procedure minus the create keyword, that would do my work, return the result and disappear. 
 Googled it a lot but couldn't find anything. :'( Just wondering if you folks know an elegant solution. 
 
 I guess you are looking for anonymous code blocks / anonymous procedures. Unfortunately it isn't supported in MySQL (it is supported in "big" RDBMSs such as Oracle or Sybase) 
 I would consider using some ORM framework, but I am not a Java developer, so I can't recommend any of them. 
 
 I don't think you can. My recommendation would be to create the "stored procedure" in Java. Write a method that takes your inputs, performs queries and calculations, then returns the dataset.
