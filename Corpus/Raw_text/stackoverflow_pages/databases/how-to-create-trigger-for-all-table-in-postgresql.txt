 This will get you set of strings which are SQL commands like: 
 
 You just need to run them at once (either by   or pgAdmin). 
 Now some explanation: 
 
 I select names of tables in my database using   system table. Because there are data of literally all tables, remember to exclude   and   schemas and toast tables from your  . 
 I use   function which will put string inside double quote signs ( ) if necessary (ie. names with spaces or capital letters require that). 
 When I have list of tables names I just concatenate them with some static strings to get my SQL commands. 
 I write that command using sub-query because I want you to get better idea of what's going on here. You may write a single query by putting   in place of  .
