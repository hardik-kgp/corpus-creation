 I'm totally new to SQL Server, I use version 2012. 
 I have a table with the following structure: 
 
 I need to create a unique constraint based on two columns (  and  ) 
 I'm not sure how to do this. I have created a query and tried this code: 
 
 But when I try to execute it, I receive this error: 
 
 Msg 156, Level 15, State 1, Line 2 
  Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'UNIQUE'. 
 
 **What is the proper way to alter the table using SSMS? Should I create a query each time I want to do so?**

 
 You were almost there. If you use the   keyword you need to provide a name. 
 
 Or alternatively 
 
 also works but then the constraint is auto named 
 
 If you prefer to do it via GUI instead of via   statements, you can also right-click on the table in Object Explorer, select "Design", then right-click somewhere on the empty background, and select "Indexes/Keys". This will open a dialog where you select ""Unique key" as the type. 
 Doing changes via GUI is a fast way for actions you tend to do rarely and hence are not sure about the syntax.  
 Many Management Studio dialogs - but not this one, probably as it is a sub dialog of the table designer dialog - have a "Script" button on the top left, which writes the action you are configuring via GUI to a query window so that you can save them for future similr tasks, or acopy and paste them, should you need similar actions.
