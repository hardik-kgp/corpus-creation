*** how-to-create-unique-index-on-fields-with-possible-null-values-oracle-11g ***

 Here is the sample table with 3 columns (ID, UNIQUE_VALUE, UNIQUE_GROUP_ID) 
 I want below records can be allowed: 
 
 or 
 
 or ( **Note: this condition is not allowed in **
** nor **
) 
 
 and these can't be allowed: 
 
 I created a unique index on last 2 columns, but only the first 2 examples can be allowed.  
 Is it possible to let db check the uniqueness of these 2 columns only when both are not null? 
 
 You want to only enforce uniqueness on the rows where both   and   are not null. To do this, you can use a unique function-based index: 
 
 
 you can use the nvl function to avoid nulls and place a different value instead , 
 
 the disadvantage is that your index will be larger and if you would like to search for null values you will have to use the nvl function in order to avoid table_access_full. 
 also all of the null values will be located under one branch in the index , so make sure your histograms are updated. 
 I Hope this will help you :)
