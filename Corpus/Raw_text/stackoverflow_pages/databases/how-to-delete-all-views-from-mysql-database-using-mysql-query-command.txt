 I need to delete all views from my mysql database. How can I do that using query? 
 Can anyone can help me please? 
 
 Quoting from  MySQL Reference Manual : 
 
  removes one or more views. You must have the   privilege for each view. If any of the views named in the argument list do not exist, MySQL returns an error indicating by name which non-existing views it was unable to drop, but it also drops all of the views in the list that do exist. 
 The   clause prevents an error from occurring for views that don't exist. When this clause is given, a   is generated for each nonexistent view. See  Section 12.7.5.41, “SHOW WARNINGS Syntax” . 
  and  , if given, are parsed and ignored.
