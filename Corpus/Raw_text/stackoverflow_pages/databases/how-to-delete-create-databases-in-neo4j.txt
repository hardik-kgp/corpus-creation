*** how-to-delete-create-databases-in-neo4j ***

 Is it possible to create/delete different databases in the graph database  Neo4j  like in MySQL? Or, at least, how to delete all nodes and relationships of an existing graph to get a clean setup for tests, e.g., using shell commands similar to   or  ? 
 
 You can just remove the entire graph directory with  , because Neo4j is not storing anything outside that: 
 
 Also, you can of course iterate through all nodes and delete their relationships and the nodes themselves, but that might be too costly just for testing ... 
 
 even more simple command to delete all nodes and relationships: 
 
 
 From Neo4j 2.3, 
 We can delete  all nodes with relationships , 
 
 Currently there is no any option to create multiple databases in Noe4j. You need to make multiple stores of Neo4j data. See  reference . 
 
 Creating new Database in Neo4j 
 Before Starting neo4j community  click the browse option  
 
 and choose a different directory  
 
 
 and click start button. 
 
 New database created on that direcory 
 
 quick and dirty way that works fine: 
 
 
 For anyone else who needs a clean graph to run a test suite -  https://github.com/jexp/neo4j-clean-remote-db-addon  is a great extension to allow clearing the db through a REST call. Obviously, though, don't use it in production! 
 
 Run your test code on a different neo4j instance. 
 
 Copy your neo4j directory into a new location. Use this for testing. cd into the new directory. 
 Change the port so that you can run your tests and use it normally simultaneously. To change the port open   and set   to an unused one. 
 Start the test server on setup. Do   and   on teardown. 
 
 For more details see  neo4j: How to Switch Database?  and the  docs . 
 
 In Neo4j 2.0.0 the ? is no longer supported. Use OPTIONAL MATCH instead:   
 
 
 Easiest answer is:  **NO**

 The best way to "start over" is to  
 
 move to another empty data folder  
 
 or  
 
 close Neo4j completely  
 empty the old data folder 
 restart Neo4j and set the empty folder as the data folder 
 
 There is a way to delete all nodes and relationships (as described  here ) 
 
 
 In 2.0.0 -M6 You can execute the following Cypher script to delete all nodes and relations: 
 
 
 As of version 3 I believe it is now possible to create separate database instances and thus their location is slightly different.  
 Referring to: https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/   
 
 The --into retail.db is obviously the target database, which must not contain an existing database. 
 
 On my Ubuntu box the location is in: 
  where I currently see only   which I believe must be the default. 
 
 You can delete your data files and if you want to go through this way, I would recommend delete just your graph.db, for example. Otherwise your are going to mess your authentication info.
