*** how-to-detect-a-sql-server-databases-read-only-status-using-t-sql ***

 I need to know how to interrogate a Microsoft SQL Server, to see if a given database has been set to   or not. 
 Is that possible, using T-SQL? 
 
 The information is stored in  . 
 
 
 Querying   for checking a DB's Read-Only property will  **only**
 give the right information if the database has been  **explicitly**
 set to Read-Only mode. 
 For databases that are in the passive servers (e.g. in AlwaysOn technology Secondary Servers), even though the databases cannot be written into, their Read-Only mode in   would still be set as  . 
 Hence, it is advisable to check the Read-Only mode of databases using the statement: 
 
 
 Here is a  command  to display or set this property.   
 
 **Sample output**
  
 
 
 I was trying to use the p.campbell's answer to check if my Azure SQL DB is the primary one or the read only replica - it didn't work. Both the primary DB and the replica returned had 0 on the is_read_only field. 
 Here's what worked for me: 
 
 the above select statement returns string 'READ_ONLY' or 'READ_WRITE'.
