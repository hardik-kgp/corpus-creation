*** how-to-disable-cascade-delete-for-link-tables-in-ef-code-first ***

 I want to disable cascade deletes for a link table with entity framework code-first.  For example, if many users have many roles, and I try to delete a role, I want that delete to be blocked  unless  there are no users currently associated with that role.  I already remove the cascade delete convention in my  : 
 
 And then I set up the user-role link table: 
 
 Yet when EF creates the database, it creates a delete cascade for the foreign key relationships, eg. 
 
 How can I stop EF generating this delete cascade? 
 
 I got the answer.  :-)  Those cascade deletes were being created because of  .  You need to remove this convention to prevent it from creating cascade deletes for link tables: 
 
 
 I agree with Ebram Khalil that turning it off for a single table is a good option. I like to stick as close to the automatically built migrations as I can, however, so I would set it up in OnModelCreating: 
 
 I believe this preserves the delete going the other direction, so if both needed to be blocked (makes sense in this example) a similar call would need to be made starting with  
 Of course, this comes ages after the question was asked. So it may not have been valid in 2012. 
 
 I believe that turning off   globally is not a wise option. Instead, it's better to turn it off  only for the concerned  table. 
 This can be achieved through editing the generated migration file, for property  . For example:
