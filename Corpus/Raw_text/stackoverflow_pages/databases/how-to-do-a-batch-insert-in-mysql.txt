*** how-to-do-a-batch-insert-in-mysql ***

 I have 1-many number of records that need to be entered into a table.  What is the best way to do this in a query?  Should I just make a loop and insert one record per iteration?  Or is there a better way? 
 
 From the  MySQL manual 
 
 INSERT statements that use VALUES
  syntax can insert multiple rows. To do
  this, include multiple lists of column
  values, each enclosed within
  parentheses and separated by commas.
  Example: 
 
 
 
 Most of the time, you are not working in a MySQL client and you should batch inserts together using the appropriate API.    
 E.g. in JDBC:

 Load data infile query is much better option but some servers like godaddy restrict this option on shared hosting so , only two options left then one is insert record on every iteration or batch insert , but batch insert has its limitaion of characters if your query exceeds this number of characters set in mysql then your query will crash , So I suggest insert data in chunks withs batch insert , this will minimize number of connections established with database.best of luck guys 
 
 mysql allows you to insert multiple rows at once  INSERT manual
