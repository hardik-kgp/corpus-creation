*** how-to-do-an-inner-join-on-multiple-columns ***

 I'm working on a homework project and I'm supposed to perform a database query which finds flights either by the city name or the airport code, but the   table only contains the airport codes so if I want to search by city I have to join on the   table. 
 The airports table has the following columns:  
The flights table has the following columns:  
The columns   and   are the  **from**
 and  **to**
 airport codes. 
The columns   and   are dates of departure and arrival.   
 I came up with a query which first joins the flights on the   column and the   column.  In order for me to match the   I have to perform another join on the previous matches from the first join. 
 
 My query returns the proper results and it will suffice for the purpose of the homework, but I'm wondering if I can   on multiple columns? How would I construct the   clause so it matches the departure and the destination city/code? 
 Below is a "pseudo-query" on what I want to acheive, but I can't get the syntax correctly and i don't know how to represent the   table for the departures and the destinations: 
 
 **Update**

 I also found  this visual representation of SQL Join statements  to be  **very**
 helpful as a general guide on how to construct SQL statements! 
 
 You can JOIN with the same table more than once by giving the joined tables an  alias , as in the following example: 
 
 Note that the   and   are aliases for the first and second copies of the   table. 
 
 something like.... 
 
 
 if mysql is okay for you: 
 
 edit: added example to filter the output for code or city 
 
 Can you just use and in the on clause? 
 For example, something like: 
 
 
 If you want to search on both FROM and TO airports, you'll want to join on the Airports table twice - then you can use both from and to tables in your results set:
