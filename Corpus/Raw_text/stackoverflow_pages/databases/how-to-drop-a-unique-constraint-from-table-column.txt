*** how-to-drop-a-unique-constraint-from-table-column ***

 I have a table 'users' with 'login' column defined as: 
 
 Now I want to remove this unique constraint/index using SQL script. I found its name  **UQ_**
**users**
**_7D78A4E7**
 in my local database but I suppose it has a different name on another database. 
 What is the best way to drop this unique constraint? Or at least any... 
 Thanks. 
 
 SKINDER, your code does not use column name. Correct script is: 
 
 
 
 
 This works mostly. 
 
 
 To drop a UNIQUE constraint, you donâ€™t need the name of the constraint, just the
list of columns that are included in the constraint. 
 The syntax would be: 
 
 
 Use this SQL command to drop a unique constraint: 
 
 
 You can use following script : 
 
 
 This statement works for me 
 
 
 I have stopped on the script like below (as I have only  **one**
 non-clustered unique index in this table): 
 
 Has anyone comments if this solution is acceptable? Any pros and cons? 
 Thanks. 
 
 Expand to database name >> expand to table >> expand to keys >> copy the name of key then execute the below command: 
 
 Here  **UQ__test__3213E83EB607700F**
 is the name of unique key which was created on a particular column on test table. 
 
 I would like to refer a previous question, Because I have faced same problem and solved by this  solution .
First of all a constraint is always built with a   value in it's name. So problem is this   is varies in different Machine or Database. For example   here   is the hash value(8 bit). So I am referring a single script which will be fruitful to all  
 
 It will drop your default constraint. However if you want to create it again you can simply try this   
 
 Finally, just simply run a   command to drop the column.  
 
 I had the same problem. I'm using DB2. What I have done is a bit not too professional solution, but it works in every DBMS: 
 
 Add a column with the same definition without the unique contraint. 
 Copy the values from the original column to the new 
 Drop the original column (so DBMS will remove the constraint as well no matter what its name was) 
 And finally rename the new one to the original 
 And a reorg at the end (only in DB2) 
 
 
 The syntax of the ALTER commands may be different in other DBMS 
 
 FOR SQL to drop a constraint 
 ALTER TABLE [dbo].[tablename] DROP CONSTRAINT [unique key created by sql]
GO 
 alternatively:
go to the keys -- right click on unique key and click on drop constraint in new sql editor window.
The program writes the code for you. 
 Hope this helps.
Avanish. 
 
 If you know the name of your constraint then you can directly use the command like 
 **alter table users drop constraint constraint_name;**

 If you don't know the constraint name, you can get the constraint by using this command 
 **select constraint_name,constraint_type 
from user_constraints
where table_name = 'YOUR TABLE NAME';**
