*** how-to-drop-all-databases-except-few-ones-in-postgres ***

 I want to drop all of the databases except few ones. 
Lets say there are 20 databases and I want to delete 18 out of them but keep 2 as it is the latest ones and are in use. 
 Please suggest.

 As accepted answer kinda demonstrates it, dropping multiple databases was particularly tedious for me, so I wrote an helper script to alleviate this operation :  https://github.com/Kraymer/ezdropdb 
 In short, you enter a pattern that the databases you want to suppress must match then all db names results are listed and there is a final prompt where you can enter which ones of those to drop (cf screenshot on project page) .
