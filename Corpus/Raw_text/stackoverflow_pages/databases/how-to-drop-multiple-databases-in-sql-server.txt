*** how-to-drop-multiple-databases-in-sql-server ***

 Just to clarify, ths isn't really a question, more some help for people like me who were looking for an answer. 
A lot of applications create temp tables and the like, but I was surprised when Team Foundation Server created 80+ databases on my test SQL Server. TFS didn't install correctly, and kindly left me to clear up after it. Since each database had a naming convention, rather than delete each database by hand, I remembered how to use cursors and have written what I view to be the most unwise piece of T-SQL ever: 
 
 It goes without saying that using cursors like this is probably really dangerous, and should be used with extreme caution. This worked for me, and I haven't seen any further damage to my database yet, but I disclaim: use this code at your own risk, and back up your vital data first! 
Also, if this should be deleted because it's not a question, I understand. Just wanted to post this somewhere people would look. 
 
 this is easy... 
 
 
 Why not just do this instead?  
 
 Capture the output of that resultset and then paste it into another query window. Then run that. Why write all this TSQL cursor code?  
 "When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail!".. 
 
 There is no need to use a cursor, and no need to copy and paste SQL statements.  Just run these two lines: 
 DECLARE @Sql as NVARCHAR(MAX) = (SELECT 'DROP DATABASE ['+ name + ']; ' FROM sys.databases WHERE name LIKE 'DBName%' FOR XML PATH('')) 
 EXEC sys.sp_executesql @Sql 
 Of course, any DB matching the criteria will be dropped immediately, so be sure that you know what you are doing.
