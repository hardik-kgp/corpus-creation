*** how-to-drop-partition-without-dropping-data-in-mysql ***

 I have a table like: 
 
 Not exactly like above but similar to that.... 
 Now assume that my table has 200000 rows and now I want to remove partitions on the table and reorganize them in accordance to requirement without MAX VALUE in it. 
 Can any one help me to rearrange partition without dropping data or dropping table and recreating it ?  
 
 
 
 You can reorganize the partition   using the   command. 
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/partitioning-management-range-list.html 
 
 If you intend to change the partitioning of a table without losing data, use ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION 
 
 
 Note that this will not make sense until you actually create several partitions e.g. 
 
 Have a look at  RANGE partitioning in MySQL 
 If your partition   is becoming too large you can split it the same way. 
 
 If you want to rearrange the data while keeping the partitions, 
you can take a look at REORGANIZE PARTITION and COALESCE PARTITION clauses of ALTER TABLE 
command. 
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html 
 
 Rearrange partitions doesn't require drop all existing partitions. You can specified the new partitioning in the   syntax directly, and no data will be lost. 
 
 P.S. Tested with MySQL 5.7.11
