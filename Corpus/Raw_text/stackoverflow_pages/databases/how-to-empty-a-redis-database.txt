*** how-to-empty-a-redis-database ***

 I've been playing with redis (and add some fun with it) during the last fews days and I'd like to know if there is a way to empty the db (remove the sets, the existing key....) easily. 
During my tests, I created several sets with a lot of members, even created sets that I do not remember the name (how can I list those guys though ?). 
Any idea about how to get rid of all of them ? 
 
 You have two options: 
 
 FLUSHDB  - clears currently active database 
 FLUSHALL  - clears all the existing databases 
 
 
 Be careful here. 
 FlushDB deletes all keys in the current database while FlushALL deletes all keys in all databases on the current host.
