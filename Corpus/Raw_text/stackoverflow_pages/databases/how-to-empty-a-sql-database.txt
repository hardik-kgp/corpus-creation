*** how-to-empty-a-sql-database ***

 I'm searching for a simple way to delete all data from a database and keep the structure (table, relationship, etc...).
I using postgreSQL but I think, if there a command to do that, it's not specific to postgres. 
 Thanks,

 Dump the schema using  . drop the database, recreate it and load the schema. 
 Dump you database schema (the -s tag) to a file: 
 
 Delete the database: 
 
 Recreate it: 
 
 Restore the schema only: 
 
 This should work on PostgreSQL; Other DBMS might have their own tools for that. I do no know of any generic tool to do it. 
 **EDIT:**

 Following comments, you might want to skip the   command, and simply create another database with the dumped schema. If all went through well, you can drop the old database: 
 
 At this point, you have the full database at DB-NAME, and an empty schema at DB-NEW-NAME. after you're sure everything is OK, use  . 
 
 You can do something like this: 
 
 It will do what's necessary. 
 Of course these exports are not necessary, but they will make it simpler to run 2 copies of psql without having to givem them all standard -U, -d, and so on, switches. 
 One thing though - using TRUNCATE to do so, while faster than DELETE, has it's drowbacks - for example - it is not being replicated by Slony and any other replication system that works on triggers. Unless you are working on PostgreSQL 8.4, and your replication knows how to use triggers on TRUNCATE. 
 
 I'm not a Postgres guy, but one option would be to iterate through the tables and issue a  Truncate  command against each one.  You'll have to take otable relationships into account, though - you will not be able to delete reference data before data that refers to it, for example. 
 
 In pgAdmin you can do: 
 
 Right-click database -> backup, select "Schema only" 
 Drop the database 
 Create a new database and name it like the former 
 Right-click the new database -> restore -> select the backup, select "Schema only" 
 
 
 your can delete all records of your database without restriction of foreign keys by following three steps 
 
 Take script of your Database

 
 Right Click on your database (your DB Name)   
 click on task  and then "Generate script" 
 Specify location  
 
 Delete your database base  
 recreate a database with the same name and run you generated script  
 
 This way you can empty all of your database
