*** how-to-enforce-unique-constraint-in-mysql ***

 I have a MySQL table defined: 
 
 
I've read here that MySQL doesn't support a   with a   condition. For each  customerId  we'd have only one  primaryImage = 1 .  
 So what else can I do to enforce this constraint? 
 
  perfectly supports unique constraints. 
 It does not support partial constraints/indexes, though, so you would need to mark non-primary images with a   instead of  . 
 
 You can insert arbitrary number of   values into   but only one non-null value per customer.
