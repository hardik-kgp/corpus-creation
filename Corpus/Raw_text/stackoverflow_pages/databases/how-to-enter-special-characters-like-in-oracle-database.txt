 If I try to run this query I am getting a popup and it asks me to enter value for  .  
 How can I enter special characters like   in the insert statement for oracle db? 
 
 If you are in SQL*Plus or SQL Developer, you want to run 
 
 before executing the SQL statement.  That turns of the checking for substitution variables. 
 SET directives like this are instructions for the client tool (SQL*Plus or SQL Developer).  They have session scope, so you would have to issue the directive every time you connect (you can put the directive in your client machine's glogin.sql if you want to change the default to have DEFINE set to OFF).  There is no risk that you would impact any other user or session in the database. 
 
 Try  
 
 Justin's answer is the way to go, but also as an FYI you can use the chr() function with the ascii value of the character you want to insert.  For this example it would be: 
 
 
 you can simply escape & by following a dot. try this: 
 
 
 To Insert values which has got '&' in it. Use the folloiwng code. 
 
 And Press F5 from Oracle or Toad Editors. 
 
 We can use another way as well
for example to insert the value with special characters 'Java_22 & Oracle_14' into db we can use the following format..  
 'Java_22 '||'&'||' Oracle_14' 
 Though it consider as 3 different tokens we dont have any option as the handling of escape sequence provided in the oracle documentation is incorrect. 
 
 If an escape character is to be added at the beginning or the end like  , then use: 
 
 
 For special character set, you need to check UNICODE Charts. After choose your character, you can use sql statement below, 
 
 -- 
 d **≈ç**
TTTT 
 
 Also you can use concat like this :D 
 
 
 There are 3 ways to do so : 
 1) Simply do SET DEFINE OFF; and then execute the insert stmt. 
 2) Simply by concatenating reserved word within single quotes and concatenating it.
E.g. Select 'Java_22 ' || '& '|| ':' || ' Oracle_14' from dual --(:) is an optional. 
 3) By using CHR function along with concatenation.
E.g. Select 'Java_22 ' || chr(38)||' Oracle_14' from dual 
 Hope this help !!!  
 
 strAdd=strAdd.replace("&","'||'&'||'"); 
 
 In my case I need to insert a row with text 'Please dial *001 for help'.
In this case the special character is an asterisk. 
 By using direct insert using sqlPlus it failed with error "SP2-0734: unknown command beginning ... " 
 I tryed set escape without success. 
 To achieve, I created a file insert.sql on filesystem with  
 
 Then from sqlPlus I executed  
 
 And row was inserted. 
 
 You can either use the backslash character to escape a single character or symbol  
 
 'Java_22 \& Oracle_14' 
 
 or braces to escape a string of characters or symbols  
 
 '{Java_22 & Oracle_14}'
