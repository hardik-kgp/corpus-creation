*** how-to-execute-multiple-queries-using-psql-command-from-bash-shell ***

 Currently I can execute single query like this: 
 
 When I tried to execute multiple queries as below, but only the last query got executed. 
 
 Can anyone help me and tell me the proper way to do it?

 The   parameter executes a file's content 
 
 All the output will be sent to standard output

 at least from 9.6.2 this approach works as well: 
 
 psql -c "select now()" -c "select version()" -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1 
 
 **              now**
