 Does anyone know how to export HSQLDB to   file or something on a computer and restore on other computer. 
 
 To get a dump of the hsqldb file using either the embedded or file/server mode. 
 In an sql tools dialog use: 
 
 This will not work with spaces in the path 
 Please see the  hsqldb docs 
 
 I was trying to export an HSQLDB database, out of an ODB file no less, and found it was very unintuitive. Oddly, I rarely found any tutorials or docs on just a simple export (the kind that is often done with, say, SQLite). I figured the included SqlTool was the right answer, but found nothing obvious ("You might use SCRIPT" is not helpful, sorry). Because this wasn't a database I knew anything about, I couldn't specify schema/table names, nor could I figure out a way to discover those. 
 In the end, I used an eval copy of RazorSQL (http://razorsql.com). I had to rename the database files to be .script, etc., according to RazorSQL's docs. I set up a Connection Profile that used the "JDBC (HSQLDB embedded)" connection type, selecting the script file that I found in the ODB database. Then I selected DB Tools from the menu, then Export Data, and selected the options that seemed appropriate (CSV file, in my case). 
 Hope this helps someone else.
