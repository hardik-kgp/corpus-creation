*** how-to-export-collection-to-csv-in-mongodb ***

 How do you export all the records in a MongoDB collection to a   file? 
 
 This asks me to specify name of the fields I need to export. Can I just export all the fields without specifying the names of fields? 
 
 @karoly-horvath has it right. Fields are required for csv. 
 According to this bug in the MongoDB issue tracker  https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-4224   **you MUST provide the fields when exporting to a csv**
. The docs are not clear on it. That is the reason for the error. 
 Try this: 
 
 **UPDATE:**

 This commit:  https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools/commit/586c00ef09c32c77907bd20d722049ed23065398  fixes the docs for 3.0.0-rc10 and later. It changes 
 
 to 
 
 **VERSION 3.0 AND ABOVE:**

 You should use   instead of   since it has been deprecated. 
 More details:  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoexport/#export-in-csv-format 
 Full command: 
 
 
 Also, you are not allowed spaces between comma separated field names.

 GOOD:
 
 
 
 You have to manually specify it and if you think about it, it makes perfect sense. MongoDB is schemaless; CSV, on the other hand, has a fixed layout for columns. Without knowing what fields are used in different documents it's impossible to output the CSV dump. 
 If you have a fixed schema perhaps you could retrieve one document, harvest the field names from it with a script and pass it to mongoexport. 
 
 If you want, you can export all collections to csv without specifying   (will export all fields). 
 From  http://drzon.net/export-mongodb-collections-to-csv-without-specifying-fields/  run this bash script 
 
 
 I could not get mongoexport to do this for me. I found that,to get an exhaustive list of all the fields, you need to loop through the entire collection once. Use this to generate the headers. Then loop through the collection again to populate these headers for each document. 
 I've written a script to do just this. Converting MongoDB docs to csv irrespective of schema differences between individual documents.

 Also if you want to export inner json fields use dot (. operator).  
 JSON record: 
 
 **mongoexport command with dot operator (using mongo version 3.4.7):**

 
 ./mongoexport --host localhost --db myDB --collection myColl
  --type=csv --out out.csv --fields  **value.deviceId,value.userIds**

 
 Output csv: 
 
 **Note: Make sure you do not export an array. It would corrupt the CSV format like field userIds shown above**
  
 
 Below command used to export collection to CSV format. 
 Note:   is database,   is a collection.
