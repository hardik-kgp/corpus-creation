*** how-to-export-database-with-adminer ***

 It's the first time i use ADMINER. 
 I want to export the database and i'm not sure to set correctly the parameters. 
 The database is in production and i don't want to make any mistakes. 
 See screenshot : 
 
 What are the correct parameters for : 
 1) Database : Use, drop + create, Create, Create + alter 
 2) Table : drop + create, Create, Create + alter 
 3) Datas : Truncate + insert, insert, insert+ update 
 
 Per your comment on or original question: 
 
 You want to recreate the database and data in a new environment and you are exporting SQL. Therefore, you will want to create tables where none exist, or discard and overwrite data if it does exist. 
 To accomplish this, you want to select the following options: 
 Database: Drop + Create - this will cause DROP statements to appear in the exported SQL before CREATE statements. This means that any existing databases with the same name will be dropped and all tables discarded. This is what you want to do if you want a clean test environment that matches production. 
 Tables: Drop + Create - for the same reason as above 
 Data: Insert - this will insert all data from your production database into your test copy database.
