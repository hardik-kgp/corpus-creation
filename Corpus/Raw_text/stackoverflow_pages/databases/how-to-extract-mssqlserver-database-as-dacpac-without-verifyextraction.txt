*** how-to-extract-mssqlserver-database-as-dacpac-without-verifyextraction ***

 I want to extract a database schema of a MSSQLServer database with Server Management Studio. I use the Extract command "Extract Data-tier Application.." 
 In the database are several references to another database. Because of this I get the following error. 
 **Error extracting database: Validation of the schema model for data package failed.
Error SQL71562: Error validating element [dbo].[x] has an unresolved reference to object [dbo].[y]. External references are not supported when creating a package from this platform.**

 The problem is, that SSMS uses the SQLPackage.exe with parameter  **/p:VerifyExtraction=True**
. When I use the console and call SQLPackage.exe without this Parameter, it uses  **/p:VerifyExtraction=False**
 by default and I can create the .dacpac file. 
 Is there a way to configure SSMS to disable verification? 
 
 I wasn't able to find a method that works in SSMS (2008 R2 or 2012), either, but Visual Studio (2013) with SSDT seems to work:  Within VS, go to SQL Server Object Explorer, connect to the server in question, right click the database in question, Extract Data-tier Application, and then adjust the Extract Settings, one of which is "Verify extraction".  I don't know why MS doesn't just build that into SSMS.  
 One somewhat-odd thing I noticed from doing, this, though, is that VS will only extract a .DacPac via this method.  Even when you choose to add data to the extract, the extension is still .DacPac.  I was under the impression that .DacPacs were solely for Schema Only, while .BacPacs were for Schema + Data.  Regardless, after VS created the .DacPac (Schema + Data) file, SSMS was able to import it fine using "Deploy Data-tier Application..." wizard.    
 
 If you cannot use Visual Studio you can use the command line   application to extract the schema from the database. By default, this  **does not**
 verify the schema (no, I don't know why SSMS and the command line offering have different defaults!).   can be found in  . 
 For example, the following extracts the schema for   from the local SQL Server instance and outputs it to a   file on the local filesystem: 
 
 If you want to include schema verification at a later stage, you can set the flag explicitly by adding   to the command line.
