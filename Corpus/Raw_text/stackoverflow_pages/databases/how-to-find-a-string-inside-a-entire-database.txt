*** how-to-find-a-string-inside-a-entire-database ***

 I have one specific string, such as "123abcd" for example but I don't know the name of the table or even the name of the column inside the table on my SQL Server Database. I want to find it with a select and show all columns of the related string, so I was wondering something like: 
 
 For obvious reasons it doens't work, but there is a simple way to create a select statement to do something like this? 
 
 This will work: 
 
 A couple caveats, though. First,  **this is outrageously slow and non-optimized**
. All values are being converted to   simply so that they can be compared without error.  You may run into problems with values like   not converting as expected and therefore not being matched when they should be (false negatives). 
 The   is there to make building the   clause easier. If there are not matches you won't get any rows back. 
 
 Here are couple more free tools that can be used for this. Both work as SSMS addins. 
 ApexSQL Search  – 100% free - searches both schema and data in tables. Has couple more useful options such as dependency tracking… 
 SSMS Tools pack  – free for all versions except SQL 2012 – doesn’t look as advanced as previous one but has a lot of other cool features.  
 
 I think you have to options: 
 
 Build a dynamic SQL using   and   to perform the search ( example here ). 
 Use any program that have this function. An example of this is  SQL Workbench  (free). 
 
 
 
 
 In oracle you can use the following sql command to generate the sql commands you need: 
 
 
 SQL Locator  (free) has worked great for me. It comes with a lot of options and it's fairly easy to use. 
 
 I usually use   and  , although like @yuck said,   and   are shorter to type. 
 In a loop, concatenate these 
 
 Then execute the resulting sql.  
 
 Common Resource Grep (crgrep) will search for string matches in tables/columns by name or content and supports a number of DBs, including SQLServer, Oracle and others. Full wild-carding and other useful options. 
 It's opensource (I'm the author).

 Sorry for the late answer, but I just had this question as well and ended up resolving it using another approach that is probably more generic to all databases.  
 
 create a database dump.  
 From there you should be able to open the file in a text editor and search for the required string. 
 
 
 Here is an easy and convenient cursor based solution
