 Does anybody know where I can find open source world city database that includes: 
 
 city names in different languages 
 region / state / province 
 country 
 IP address range 
 longitude / latitude 
 
 
 For everywhere except the US, try the  National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's GNS Country Files  dataset  and for the USA, use the  USGS Domestic Names Database . This data is copyright free and relatively easy to import into MySQL. 
 These do not include IP address ranges, that sort of data is commercially available from folks like  MaxMind 
 
 MaxMind's GeoLite City database is free: 
 http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity 
 The website has instructions for inserting the contents into a database table. 
 It contains city, region/state/province, country, IP address range, latitude, longitude and a bunch more info.

 This one contains world cities and Latitude / Longitude  
 You can also get a world database at geonames org
