*** how-to-find-number-of-rows-in-heroku-database ***

 The title pretty much sums up my question, but here are more details: 
 I'm running a script to import rows into a heroku database. I started getting errors: 
 
 The script runs smoothly on my localhost so I'm not looking for problems there. I recently received an email from heroku stating that I'm "Approaching row limit for dev database" 
 I'm assuming I hit the row limit but I'd like to confirm this before taking further action.  
 Does anyone know how I can find my current row count for the whole database? (I know I can just do a count on each table but I'm hoping there's a cleaner way) 
 
 If you have the heroku cli tool, this will give you, among other things, the number of rows in your database 
 
 Also given are your plan type, the db status, the number of current connections, postgres version, when the db was created, the number of rows in your plan, the data size, the number of tables and if your db has any fork/follow options activated.  
 
 This will give you the approximate count of all rows within your database:  
 
 Though the error message indicates some error on your database, likely a constraint violation versus something with your insert privileges being revoked. 
 
 Heroku released  a "pg-extras" toolbelt  which can give you extra informations like the number of rows of your database. 
 Even if you have a higher plan than Hobby, you will get the number of rows by doing the following: 
 
 Then: 
 
 This will give you the number of rows per table.
