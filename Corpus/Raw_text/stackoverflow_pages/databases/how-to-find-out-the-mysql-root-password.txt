*** how-to-find-out-the-mysql-root-password ***

 I cannot figure out my MySQL root password; how can I find this out? Is there any file where this password is stored?  
 I am following this  link  but I do not have directadmin directory in local. 
 
 thanks to @thusharaK I could reset the root password without knowing the old password. 
 On ubuntu I did the following: 
 
 Then run mysql in a new terminal: 
 
 And run the following queries to change the password: 
 
 In MySQL 5.7, the password field in mysql.user table field was removed, now the field name is 'authentication_string'. 
 Quit the mysql safe mode and start mysql service by: 
 
 
 You can't view the hashed password; the only thing you can do is reset it! 
 Stop MySQL: 
 
 or 
 
 Start it in safe mode: 
 
 (above line is the whole command) 
 This will be an ongoing command until the process is finished so open another shell/terminal window, log in without a password: 
 
 MySQL 5.7 and over:  
 
 Start MySQL: 
 
 or 
 
 Your new password is 'password'. 
 
 MySQL 5.7 and above saves root in MySQL log file. 
 Please try this: 
 
 
 You cannot find it. It is stored in a database, which you need the root password to access, and even if you did get access somehow, it is hashed with a one-way hash. You can reset it:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html 
 
 Follow these steps to reset password in Windows system 
 
 Stop Mysql service from task manager 
 Create a text file and paste the below statement 
 
 
 MySQL 5.7.5 and earlier: 
 
 
 
 
 MySQL 5.7.6 and later: 
 
 
 
 Save as   and place it in  . 
 Open command prompt and paste the following 
 
 
 
 one thing that tripped me up on a new install of mySQL and wonder why I couldn't get the default password to work and why even the reset methods where not working. 
well turns out that on Ubuntu 18 the most recent version of mysql server does not use password auth at all for the root user by default. So this means it doesn't matter what you set it to, it won't let you use it. it's expecting you to login from a privileged socket.
so  
 
 will not work at all, even if you are using the correct password!!! it will deny access no matter what you put in. 
 Instead you need to use 
 
 that will work with out any password.
then once you in you need type in 
 
 then log out and now the bloody thing will finally accept your password 
 
 Unless the package manager requests you to type the root password during installation, the default root password is the empty string. To connect to freshly installed server, type: 
 
 To change the password, get back the unix shell and type: 
 
 The new password is 'root'. Now connect to the server: 
 
 Oops, the password has changed. Use the new one,  : 
 
 Bingo! New do something interesting

 As addition to the other answers, in a cpanel installation, the mysql root password is stored in a file named  . (and the cpanel service resets it back on change, so the other answers here won't help) 
 
 you can view mysql root password , well i have tried it on mysql 5.5 so do not know about other new version well work or not  
 
 
 The default password which worked for me after immediate installation of mysql server is :  
 
 The procedure changes depending the version of MySql. Follow the procedure exactly as described for your version: 
 
 HINTS - Read before the instructions page for your version of MySql* 
 In step 5: Instead of run CMD, create a shortcut on your desktop calling CDM.exe. Then right-click on the shortcut and select "Execute as Administrator". 
 In step 6: Skip the first proposed version of the command and execute the second one, the one with the --defaults-file parameter 
 Once you execute the command, if everything is ok, the CMD window remains open and the command of step 6 continues executing. Simply close the window (click 'x'), and then force close MySQl from the Task Manager. 
 Delete the file with the SQL commands, and start again MySQL. The password must be changed now. 
 
 5.0

 5.1
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/resetting-permissions.html 
 ... just change the version in the link (5.5, 5.6, 5.7) 
 
 In your "hostname".err file inside the data folder MySQL works on, try to look for a string that starts with: 
 "A temporary password is generated for roor@localhost " 
 you can use 
 
 then slash command  followed by the string you wish to look for  
 
 Then press n, to go to the Next result. 
 
 This worked for me: 
 On terminal type the following 
 
 Enter password:// just press enter 
 mysql> 
 
 Answers provided here did not seem to work for me, the trick turned out to be:
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'test';

 **System:**
  
 
 CentOS Linux 7 
 mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25 
 
 **Procedure:**
  
 
 Open two shell sessions, logging in to one as the Linux root user
and the other as a nonroot user with access to the   command. 
 In your root session, stop the normal mysqld listener and start a
listener which bypasses password authentication ( note: this is a
significant security risk  as anyone with access to the   
command may access your databases without a password.  You may want 
to close active shell sessions and/or disable shell access before 
doing this): 
 
 
 In your nonroot session, log in to mysql and set the mysql root password: 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 In your root session, kill the passwordless instance of mysqld and restore the normal mysqld listener to service: 
 
 
 In your nonroot session, test the new root password you configured above: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I solved this a different way, this may be easier for some. 
 I did it this way because I tried starting in safe mode but cannot connect with the error:
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2) 
 What I did was to connect normally as root: 
 
 Then I created a new super user: 
 
 Then log in as myuser 
 
 Trying to change the password gave me no errors but did nothing for me so I dropped and re-created the root user 
 
 The root user is now working with the new password 
 
 Go to phpMyAdmin > config.inc.php > $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '';
