*** how-to-find-power-of-a-number-in-sqlite ***

 I want to update the Interest field in my database. My SQL query is like as per below  
 
 Update Table_Name set Interest  = Principal * Power(( 1 + (rate /
  100),year) 
 
 This query works fine in MySQL but don't work with SQLite. 
 The error says that  **No Power funcation found**
  
 Does anyone know how to resolve this problem as I have to do this using query to update more than 3000 records at a time.  
 
 SQLite doesn't have a lot of functions available. But the good news is that is easy enough to add your own. 
 Here's how to do it using the C API (which also works from Objective-C code). 
 First write a power function: 
 
 Then you need to register the function: 
 
 The   is the number of arguments for the function.   is of course the   database reference.

 Step was to build the Math extensions library that some wonderful person named Liam Healy wrote: 
 Enter following command in terminal : 
 Step 1) Download/ Open link  http://sqlite.org/contrib/download/extension-functions.c?get=25 
 Step 2) Go to location where extension-functions.c is downloaded. Run command        This will create file libsqlitefunctions.dylib at same place then you can use that in your ios application from xcode.  
 Now in your cocoa app you can add: 
 
 and then you have access to all kinds of glorious methods like COS, SQRT, etc! You can use them in your app like this: 
 
 
 If you are using SQLite NuGet package in a .NET project, you can write an extension method and bind it at runtime; 
 
 And then use it like this; 
 
 
 SQLite doesn't provide a power function or operator. You'll have to implement it yourself via  . 
 
 You can also create an SQLite  **user-defined function**
 from python. Based on the example at docs.python.org:  sqlite3.Connection.create_function 
 Create a python function: 
 
 Create a SQLite user-defined function based on the python function: 
 
 Use it: 
 
 
 This could be solved with SQL
