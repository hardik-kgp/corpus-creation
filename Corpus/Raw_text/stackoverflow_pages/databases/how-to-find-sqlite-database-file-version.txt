*** how-to-find-sqlite-database-file-version ***

 I have few sqlite database files. I want to know the database file version i.e if the database was created with sqlite2 or sqlite3 or any other main/sub version (not the sqlite library or driver or user_version or schema_version). 
 
 You can write this command in any sqlite explorer which will give the sqlite version 
 
 
 You can get version number of a database file by the  : 
 
 sqlite2 ==> first 48 bytes 
 sqlite3 ==> first 16 bytes 
 
 
 
 
 The easier way is using the   command: 
 
 
 The correct answer from version 3 of sqlite program is: 
 
 
 Get user_version:  run sql:  
 Get schema_version:  
 When create database file (.db), user_version can be set by user. 
 
 You can extract the information from the  header file . It will require you to open the database file 'by hand' but I don't know if there is an API function to get this information. 
 
 If you have a data connection to it in Visual Studio, you can right click on the data base in Server Explorer, select properties, and the version will be shown in the properties window, (under Version, surprisingly).  You might need to left click the database first to open it. 
 
 I found this to be the easiest method to determine the version of sqlite.
Run the Python IDLE Shell, then do the following: 
 
 In my case it was 2.6.0.
Hope this helps...
