*** how-to-find-the-mysql-data-directory-from-command-line-in-windows ***

 In linux I could find the mysql installation directory with the command  . But I could not find any in windows. I tried   and it resulted many paths along with path to mysql bin.  
 I wanted to find the mysql data directory from command line in windows for use in batch program. I would also like to find mysql data directory from linux command line. Is it possible? or how can we do that? 
 In my case, the mysql data directory is on the installation folder i.e.   It might be installed on any drive however. I want to get it returned from the command line. 
 
 You can issue the following query from the command line:

 Or if you want only the data dir use: 
 
 These commands work on Windows too,  **but you need to invert the single and double quotes**
. 
 Btw, when executing   in Linux as you told, you'll not get the  installation  directory on Linux. You'll only get the binary path, which is   on Linux, but you see the mysql installation is using multiple folders to store files. 
 
 If you need the value of datadir as output, and only that, without column headers etc, but you don't have a GNU environment (awk|grep|sed ...) then use the following command line: 
 
 The command will select the value only from mysql's internal   database and disables the tabular output and column headers. 
 Output on Linux: 
 
 
 You can try this-  
 
 PS- It works on every platform. 
 
 if you want to find datadir in linux or windows you can do following command   
   
 if you are interested to find datadir you can use grep & awk command
