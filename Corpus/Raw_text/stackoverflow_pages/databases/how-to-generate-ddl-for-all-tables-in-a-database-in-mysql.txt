 How to generate the DDL for all tables in a database of MySQL at once. I know that the following query will output the DDL for a table. But I want DDL of all tables at once because I am having hundreds of tables in my database. 
 
 For example: 
 
 The above query will result in DDL of   table.  
 I am using MySQL with MySQL workbench on Windows OS.  
 
 You can do it using the mysqldump command line utility: 
 
 The   option means "without data". 
 
 @tftdias above made a comment that is partially correct: 
 The issue was the space between the -p and 'pps' as the password.  You can absolutely freetext your password on the command line.  You just shouldn't, as a general security rule.  In linux, with a proper configuration, you can add a space (" ") BEFORE the first character on your command line, and that line will not enter into 'history'.  I would recommend that whenever you cleartext your password (don't do it!), that you at least put a space first so that the password is not in visible history. 
 
 You must get list of all the tables in database and then run this query.
check this link to get list of all tables:
