*** how-to-generate-random-data-in-sql-server ***

 I want to create a stored procedure to insert random data in 'Video' table. I have already generated 30,000 record data for UserProfile table.  
 Note: The username is FK element in Video table. 
 
 
 It's not too difficult to generate random data, even in SQL 
 For example, to get a random username from your userprofile table. 
 
 To generate a random integer... 
 
 To generate a random varchar string 
 
 And finally, a random date 
 
 
 As Aaron already suggested in his comment – I wouldn’t really reinvent the wheel. 
 Just go and find some of the already available tools for this.  
 Here  is an article on how to do this in VS and thread here on StackOverflow. 
 Data generators for SQL server?
