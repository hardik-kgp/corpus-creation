*** how-to-generate-the-whole-database-script-in-mysql-workbench ***

 I want to take the whole database. Where do I find the database file? 
 And is there a way to write the whole database with all data to a text file (like the one in SQL Server)? 
 
 Q#1: I would guess that it's somewhere on your MySQL server?
Q#2: Yes, this is possible. You have to establish a connection via Server Administration. There you can clone any table or the entire database. 
 This tutorial  might be useful.

 **How to generate SQL scripts for your database in Workbench**

 
 In  Workbench Central  (the default "Home" tab) connect to your MySQL instance, opening  a  SQL Editor  tab. 
 Click on the  SQL Editor  tab and select your database from the  SCHEMAS  list in the  Object Browser  on the left. 
 From the menu select   and follow the prompts. The wizard will lead you through connecting to your instance, selecting your database, and choosing the types of objects you want to reverse engineer. 
When you're all done, you will have at least one new tab called  MySQL  Model. You may also have a tab called  EER Diagram  which is cool but not relevant here. 
 Click in the  MySQL Model  tab 
 Select  
 Follow the prompts. Many options present themselves, including  Generate INSERT Scripts for Tables  which allows you to script out the data contained within your tables (perfect for lookup tables).  
 Soon you will see the generated script in front of you. At this point you can   or  .  
 
 The wizard will take you further, but if you just want the script you can stop here. 
 A word of caution: the scripts are generated with   commands. If you want   you'll have to (as far as I can tell) manually change the CREATEs to ALTERs. 
 This is guaranteed to work, I just did it tonight. 
 
 In MySQL Workbench 6, commands have been repositioned as the "Server Administration" tab is gone.  
 You now find the option "Data Export" under the "Management" section when you open a standard server connection. 
 
 there is data export option in MySQL workbech 
 
 
 I found this question by searching Google for "mysql workbench export database sql file". The answers here did not help me, but I eventually did find the answer, so I am posting it here for future generations to find: 
 **Answer**

 In MySQLWorkbench 6.0, do the following: 
 
 Select the appropriate database under MySQL Connections 
 On the top-left hand side of screen, under the MANAGEMENT heading, select "Data Export". 
 
 Here is a screenshot for reference: 
 
 
 In the top menu of MySQL Workbench click on database and then on forward engineer. In the options menu with which you will be presented, make sure to have "generate insert statements for tables" set. 
 
 Try the export function of  phpMyAdmin . 
 I think there is also a possibility to copy the database files from one server to another, but I do not have a server available at the moment so I can't test it. 
 
 None of these worked for me. I'm using Mac OS 10.10.5 and Workbench 6.3. What worked for me is  **Database->Migration Wizard...**
 Flow the steps very carefully 
 
 Surprisingly the Data Export in the MySql Workbench is not just for data, in fact it is ideal for generating SQL scripts for the whole database (including views, stored procedures and functions) with just a few clicks. If you want just the scripts and no data simply select the "Skip table data" option. It can generate separate files or a self contained file. Here are more details about the feature:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mysql-connections-navigator-management-data-export.html 
 
 in mysql workbench server>>>>>>export Data
then follow instructions it will generate insert statements for all tables data each table will has .sql file for all its contained data
