*** how-to-get-all-table-names-from-a-database ***

 I'd like to retrieve all table names from a database schema, and, if possible, get all table starting with a specified prefix.  
 I tried using JDBC's   but it didn't work at all. 
 
 Could someone help me on this? 
 
 You need to iterate over your ResultSet calling  . 
 This is an example from  java2s.com : 
 
 Column  **3**
 is the   (see documentation of  ). 
 
 
 
 In your example problem is passed table name pattern in getTables function of DatabaseMetaData.  
 Some database supports Uppercase identifier, some support lower case identifiers. For example oracle fetches the table name in upper case, while postgreSQL fetch it in lower case.  
 DatabaseMetaDeta provides a method to determine how the database stores identifiers, can be mixed case, uppercase, lowercase see: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#storesMixedCaseIdentifiers()   
 From below example, you can get all tables and view of providing table name pattern, if you want only tables then remove "VIEW" from TYPES array. 
 
 
 If you want to use a high-level API, that hides a lot of the JDBC complexity around database schema metadata, take a look at this article:  http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/32443/1954
