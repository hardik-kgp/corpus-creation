*** how-to-get-current-datetime-in-sql ***

 Want to get   to insert into   column. I am using   database. My questions are: 
 
 is there a function available in SQL? or  
 it is implementation depended so each database has its own function for this? 
 what is the function available in MySQL? 
 
 
 Complete answer: 
 **1. Is there a function available in SQL?**

Yes, the SQL 92 spec, Oct 97, pg. 171, section 6.16 specifies this functions: 
 
 **2. It is implementation depended so each database has its own function for this?**

Each database has its own implementations, but they have to implement the three function above if they comply with the SQL 92 specification (but depends on the version of the spec) 
 **3. What is the function available in MySQL?**
  
 
 (As SixFootTallRabbit says) 
 
 I always just use NOW(): 
 
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_now 
 
  returns  
  returns  
  returns  
 
 I want my datetime, and I want it  now() ! 
 For MySQL, anyway. 
 
 
 I guess NOW() doesn't work sometime and gives error  **'NOW' is not a recognized built-in function name.**

 Hope it helps!!! Thank You.

 For SQL Server use GetDate() or current_timestamp. You can format the result with the Convert(dataType,value,format). Tag your question with the correct Database Server. 
 
 Just an add on for SQLite you can also use  
 
CURRENT_TIME
CURRENT_DATE
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 
 for the current time, current date and current timestamp. 
You will get the same results as for SQL 
 sql   sqlite 
 
 
  or   are now superseded by the richer  ,  , and   (in SQL 2008) 
 Yes, I don't think   has ever declared anything, and so each manufacturer has their own. 
 That would be  
 
 Hope this helps...
