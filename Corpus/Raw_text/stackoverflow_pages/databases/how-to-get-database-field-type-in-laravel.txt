*** how-to-get-database-field-type-in-laravel ***

 Is there a way to get the datatype of a database table field?
Almost like a inverse of migration. 
 For example, if the migration of a users table column looks like  
 
 Is there a function that will return   if I specify table   and column  ? 
 I'm not interested in a specific database implementation, ( ).  Like Laravel's migration, it needs to be database agnostic. 
 
 After digging in Laravel, this is what I got. 
 
 
 **Short answer: Yes, that functionality exists**

 After scouring the code, I found that you could. Skip below to  **"The Solution"**
 to see it.  
 Eloquent, and the Database classes, use PDO, which does not tie you a specific SQL-based database. 
 Therefore, you should be able to do something like this: 
 
 Note that the connection object can  return the instance of PDO . 
 There are some methods like  getColumnMeta ,  **but they aren't fully supported across all drivers**
. 
 **However**
, some googling seems to point out that the best way might be to use  ANSI-standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA  - using sql queries to get that information. 
 **The solution**

 **Lastly**
, Laravel includes the Doctrine library as a dependency, which does contain some  schema functionality . 
 
 Sidenote: Doctrine is, in fact, included for its schema-based functionalities - Laravel doesn't use Doctrine's ORM 
 
 See  here  on the same connection object where we retrieved the PDO instance, we can get the doctrine connection and schema manager. You should be able to call: 
 
 You can then use the schema manager ( docs here ) to get what you're after. 
 
 For Laravel 5.2 - 5.5+, use  Builder::getColumnType() 
 
 
 I use this with laravel 4.1,, 
 
 or to get specific table use this:  
 
 Use this expression with a dial-down function to show you array details of all your table's fields: 
 
 
 Generalizing: 
 
 It works on Laravel 5.3. 
 
 **Within the model: laravel5.x**

 
    $temp = $this->newQuery()->fromQuery("SHOW FIELDS FROM ".$this->getTable());

    foreach($temp as $val){
       echo 'Field: '.$val->Field;
       echo 'Type: '.$val->Type;
   }
