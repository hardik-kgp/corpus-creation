*** how-to-get-database-name-in-pdo ***

 
 Is there a function or constant within PDO that stores the database name (the   value) ? I did a var_dump on $dbh and cant find anything... 
 
 You could use the   (essentially a key value pair) method to store the database name when you set it up initially, then use the   later in your code to see what the value is.

 Given you're on mysql, you can do   to get the name of the default database. 
 
 
 Nope, there is no built-in feature. 
 But you can extend  , parse and store dsn and return it by some accessor
