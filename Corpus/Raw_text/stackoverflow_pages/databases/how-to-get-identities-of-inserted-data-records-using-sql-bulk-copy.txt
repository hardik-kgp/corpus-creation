*** how-to-get-identities-of-inserted-data-records-using-sql-bulk-copy ***

 I have an ADO.NET   with about 100,000 records. In this table there is a column    which has no values in it, because the column is an auto-generated   in my SQL Server database. 
 I need to retrieve the generated IDs for other processes. I am looking for a way to bulk copy this   into the SQL Server database, and within the same "step" to "fill" my   with the generated IDs.  
 How can I retrieve the identity values of records inserted into a table using the   class? 
 
 I'm currently doing something like this: 
 
 Note that our data design enables filtering for all our new objects by using the version ID; every row we're adding will have the same version id, and we've previously removed any rows in the database that already had this version id. 
 However, my select query is currently timing out in ExecuteReader, even with that 10-minute window.  So this is not our final solution.
