 How do I get the (extended) result/error code from an SQLite query in Python?
For example: 
 
 Now suppose the first column should be unique and there is already a database entry with "John" in the first column. This will throw an IntegrityError, but I'd like to know the SQLite result/error code as stated on  http://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html#extrc .
I want to know, because I want to take a different action for different errors. 
 
 Currently, you  can't  get error codes through Python's   module. Per  https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/errcode.html , the C API exposes basic error codes, extended error codes, and error messages through  ,   and   respectively. However, searching the CPython source reveals that: 
 
  never even gets called 
  gets called and the result exposed as an Exception message 
  gets called, but the result is never exposed directly; it's just used to decide which Exception class to raise 
 
 While the feature you're asking for would be useful (indeed, I  need  it right now for debugging and am frustrated by its absence), it simply doesn't exist right now.
