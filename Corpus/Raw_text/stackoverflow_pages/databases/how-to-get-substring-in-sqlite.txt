*** how-to-get-substring-in-sqlite ***

 Then how do I get the substring from description? thanks 
 
 Use the   function. 
 From the  list of core functions : 
 
 
 
 The   function returns a substring of input string   that
  begins with the  -th character and which is   characters long. If   is
  omitted then   returns all characters through the end of the
  string   beginning with the Y-th. The left-most character of   is
  number 1. If   is negative then the first character of the substring
  is found by counting from the right rather than the left. If   is
  negative then the   characters preceding the  -th character are
  returned. If   is a string then characters indices refer to actual
  UTF-8 characters. If   is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes.

 You can use the builtin function in SQLite which is  . The x field represents the string input to be sliced, the y and z field represents the starting point and ending point respectively using an index.  
 
 Now we will try to make a select query for our description 
 
 Output would be:  **Lore**
