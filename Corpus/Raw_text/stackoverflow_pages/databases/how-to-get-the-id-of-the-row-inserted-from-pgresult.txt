*** how-to-get-the-id-of-the-row-inserted-from-pgresult ***

 I've ran a simple insert command: 
 
 As a response I get a  PG::Result object . I've been digging through those docs but I can't squeeze out of that object the info I need: what is the ID of the row I've just inserted? 
 
 
 I used   just to show you can return everything not just the id. But obviously if you only need the id or the id and some other column use the explicit form just as you would in a select list
