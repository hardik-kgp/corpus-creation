 How can I get record 34 of a table if the last record is record 35 ? 
 
 If you  know  there are 35 records, you want  . 
 If you want to get the 2nd last element from  any  set, you can invert the order of the set and select one element, offset one element. You can implement this yourself by first selecting the first two elements of the inversely ordered set, and then reverse the set and select the first element: 
 
 
 Simplest method 
 
 This will pick one record starting with the 2nd LIMIT 1,1 means skip first and pick next 
 The order by will have to be done so that last is first
The col mentioned will most probably be id 
 If you know the number of the record you want however why can't you just select where id=34?
