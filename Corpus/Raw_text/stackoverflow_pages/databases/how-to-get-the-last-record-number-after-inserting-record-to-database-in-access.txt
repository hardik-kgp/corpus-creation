 More about this :  Getting the identity of the most recently added record

 I guess you could even write an extension method for  ... 
 
 
 I like more indicate the type of command 
is very similar to the good solution provided by Pranay Rana 
 
 
 
 
 Using @Lee.J.Baxter 's method (Which was great as the others id not work for me!) I escaped the Extension Method and just added it inline within the form itself:              
 
 **NOTE:**
 In most cases you should use Parameters instead of the string.Format() method I used here. I just did so this time as it was quicker and my insertion values are not coming from a user's input so it should be safe.
