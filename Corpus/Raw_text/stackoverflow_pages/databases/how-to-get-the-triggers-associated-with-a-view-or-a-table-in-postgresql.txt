*** how-to-get-the-triggers-associated-with-a-view-or-a-table-in-postgresql ***

 I have one requirement that I have to get the list of triggers associated to the given table/view. 
Can anyone help me to find the triggers for a table in PostgreSQL? 
 
 This will return all the details you want to know 
 
 or if you want to sort the results of a specific table then you can try 
 
 
 the following will return table name that has trigger 
 
 
 The problem with the view   (besides being slow) is,  per documentation : 
 
 The view triggers contains all triggers defined in the current
  database on tables and views that the current user owns or has some
  privilege other than   on. 
 
 Meaning, you only get to see triggers you have appropriate privileges on. 
 To see  all  triggers for a table, look in the system catalog  
 
 Works for tables  and  views. 
Or you could use a GUI like pgAdmin that displays the list under the table node in the object browser. 
 
 On psql command-line tool you can also use   (from  https://serverfault.com/questions/331024/how-can-i-show-the-content-of-a-trigger-with-psql ) 
 
 
 
 I noticed that infoschema does NOT contain key relation table information about triggers (at least in postgres 10).  pg_triggers does contain this info.  Also noticed that datagrip will not script relation tables when you script the triggers, so i'm assuming that it uses infoschema to script them (and then your table would be missing the relation tables, and the trigger functions referencing them would fail). PG documentation says that columns in infoschema for action_reference_old_table applies to a feature not available in postgres(10), but i'm definitely using them, and they definitely show up in pg_triggers.  FYI.
