*** how-to-get-true-size-of-mysql-database ***

 I would like to know how much space does my MySQL database use, in order to select a web host.
I found the command   so when I do the query, I get something like this: 
 
 
 numbers are rounded. 
 
 So do I have  **362000**
  or 400*362000 =  **144800000**
 bytes of data for this table?
And what does Index Length mean?
Thanks !

 You can get the size of your Mysql database by running the following command in Mysql client 
 
 
 If you use phpMyAdmin, it can tell you this information. 
 Just go to "Databases" (menu on top) and click "Enable Statistics". 
 You will see something like this: 
 
 This will probably lose some accuracy as the sizes go up, but it should be accurate enough for your purposes.

 MySQL Utilities by Oracle have a command called mysqldiskusage that displays the disk usage of every database:  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.6/en/mysqldiskusage.html 
 
 If you are using MySql Workbench, its very easy to get all details of Database size, each table size, index size etc. 
 
 Right Click on Schema 
 Select  **Schema Inspector**
 option 
 
 It Shows all details of Schema size  
 Select  **Tables**
 Tab to see size of each table. 
 
 Table size diplayed in Data Lenght column

 If you have large databases, you can use the following command to show the result in gigabytes; 
 
 If you want to show the size of only a specific database, for example  , you could use the following query;
