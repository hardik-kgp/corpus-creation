*** how-to-identify-db2-port-number ***

 I have to make DB2 connection in java using port number.
Is there any command in DB2 or any way that can get the DB2 port number? 
 I have not used the default port 50000 while making DB2 connection as this port can be changed during DB2 installation.
Please suggest any DB2 command or any other alternative. 
 
 On the Windows DB2 server, open a DB2 Command Window and execute the command 
 
 This should provide some output like: 
 
 SVCENAME is the port that DB2 is listening on.  To resolve this name to an actual port number, you need to refer to the services file, which is located at  .   
 
 Go to DB2 command prompt. 
 Issue the command to get the db2 instance 
 Command :   **db2 get instance**

 Issue the command to find the TCP/IP service name 
 Command :   **db2 get dbm cfg | grep SVCE**

 **Example**
  
 db2 get dbm cfg | grep SVCE 
 TCP/IP Service name                          (SVCENAME) = db2c_db2inst9
The TCP/IP service name is " **db2c_db2inst9**
" 
 Use the  TCP/IP  service name to find the port number in the /etc/services file  
 Command :   **grep TCP/IPservicename /etc/services**
  
 Change  **TCP/IPservicename**
 with the current service name. 
 **Example**
  
 grep db2c_db2inst9 /etc/services 
 db2c_db2inst9   50090/tcp 
 The DB2 instance is running on the port number  **50090**

 
 On the Linux/Unix DB2 server, open a shell terminal and logon with the instance owner. Execute the below command: 
 
 Like the answer of Ian Bjorhvde you show the TCP/IP Service name,
SVCENAME you can view in the file /etc/service . 
 
 Probably you have different instances in your server, that means, DB2 is listening in different ports.
First, you have to list the instances in the server 
 
 You will get a set of instance names. For each one you have to get the port name 
 Windows 
 
 Linux 
 
 If you do not change the instance, you will only get the service name of the current instance.
Another way to get that information from the client is via the Configuration Assistant (db2ca). With advanced view, you right click on an instance, and then you will get the details of the instance: port number, service name, etc. 
 
 This will give the ports of all the db2 instance installed on the machine (for Linux or AIX systems)
