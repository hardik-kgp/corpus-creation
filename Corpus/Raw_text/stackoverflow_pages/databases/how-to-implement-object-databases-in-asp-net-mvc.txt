*** how-to-implement-object-databases-in-asp-net-mvc ***

 I started my project in Asp.net MVC(c#) & SQL Server 2005.I want to implement Object Databases in my project.
While searched in google i found " MongoDb " &  db4o 
 I didn't have enough knowledge in Object Databases & which one best suited for SQL Server 2005. 
 Please suggest a good example/reference regarding Object Databases implementation in Asp.net MVC application 
 
 For a good introduction to MongoDB with C#, you might look at this series:

 As for using it from ASP.net MVC, I don't know of any reference-implementation yet. 
 
 I guess you want to get started in MongoDb with asp.net MVC. In that case get the latest community supported drivers for Mongodb from  http://github.com/samus/mongodb-csharp  and follow this step by step blog post  http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2009/10/13/experimenting-with-mongodb-from-c.aspx 
 
 Have a look at Rob Conery's blog at  http://www.wekeroad.com . He's been doing a lot of work lately with MongoDB. His main project which provides an object persistence interface, although it is still very much a work in progress, can be found on  github as NoRM . 
 
 What exactly do you want to implement? What do you mean saying "Object Databases"? Most likely you just need an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) tool to work with RDBMS in object-oriented way. You can find list of ORMs  here .
