*** how-to-import-database-of-sqlite-to-mathematica ***

 I want to use mathematica to analyze some data of sqlite? 
 But i don't know how to do that . 
 And I'm not sure whether mathematica support the data of sqlite. 
 
 Apparently, SQLite support is  already available in Mathematica  though it is undocumented. As such, proceed carefully! 
 Open a database with: 
 
 Then run SQL statements with: 
 
 That should be enough for you to get going. (You have to pull data into Mathematica from the database to analyze it; nothing can be done while it is just “at rest” on disk. If you're doing complex analyses, it might be worth your while to put some of that in the SQL queries, especially if there are sensible indices set on the database.)
