*** how-to-increase-mysql-connectionsmax-connections ***

 Every socket of MySQL Database will have defaults connections as 100 but I am looking for any way to increase the number of possible connections > 100 to a socket connection of MySQL Database. 
 
 If you need to increase MySQL Connections without MySQL restart do like below 
 
 These settings will change at MySQL Restart.

 For MySQL 3.x: 
 
 For MySQL 4.x and 5.x: 
 
 Restart MySQL once you’ve made the changes and verify with: 
 
 **EDIT:-**

 The maximum concurrent connection can be  **maximum range: 4,294,967,295**

 I had the same issue and I resolved it with MySQL workbench, as shown in the attached screenshot:  
 
 in the navigator (on the left side), under the section "management", click on "Status and System variables",  
 then choose "system variables" (tab at the top),  
 then search for "connection" in the search field,  
 and 5. you will see two fields that need to be adjusted to fit your needs (max_connections and mysqlx_max_connections). 
 
 Hope that helps! 
 The system does not allow me to upload pictures, instead please click on this link and you can see my screenshot...
