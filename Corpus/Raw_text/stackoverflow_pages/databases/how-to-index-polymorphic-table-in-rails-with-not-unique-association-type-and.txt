*** how-to-index-polymorphic-table-in-rails-with-not-unique-association-type-and ***

 I have a polymorphic table called "Votes", where has votes from Answers and Questions. 
 Votes 
 
 In this case, the answer with id = 2 has two votes up. 
 The question is:  **How to index this table?**

 **First approach:**

 
 This will not work because duplicate key value will violates unique constraint 
 **Second approach:**

 
 This one I guess will not have much performance because of the composite queries for id and type at the same time. 
 **Third approach:**

 
 Is this last one a good one? Are three columns to be indexed too much? 
 Thanks 
 
 your first approach is the right one 
 
 as long as you don't add   it will  **not**
 be unique. And you shouldnâ€™t make it unique, as this would result in only one vote per votable would be possible. As  Tashos  states in the comments.  
 The third approach would work too, and here you can use a   constraint, so every user can only vote once per votable.
