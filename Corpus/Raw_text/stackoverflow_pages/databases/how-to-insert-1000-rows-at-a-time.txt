*** how-to-insert-1000-rows-at-a-time ***

 I made Wpf appliaction. I want to test it with 1000 values in grid. I want to check that whether my grid will load 1000 data records fastly or not. So how to write one query to insert more than 1000 records in my database table. can i use for loop. 
 
 I am using Sql-Server 2012 and ADO.net Connectivity! I want to execute this query in database to generate 1000 rows 
 **EDIT**

 **What if i want to insert unique names?**

 
 I create a   table with three column  . show you this example 
 
 this is the result about the example
 
 
 **If you have a DataTable in your application, and this is where the 1000 names are coming from**
, you can use a table-valued parameter for this. 
 First, a table type: 
 
 Then a procedure to use this: 
 
 Then your C# code can say: 
 
 **If you just want to generate 1000 rows with random values**
: 
 
 **In neither of these cases should you be using while loops or cursors. IMHO.**

 
 You can insert multiple records by inserting from a result: 
 
 Just add as many records you like. There may be limitations on the complexity of the query though, so it might not be possible to add as many as 1000 records at once. 
 
 You can of course use a loop, or you can insert them in a single statement, e.g. 
 
 It really depends where you're getting your data from. 
 If you use a loop, wrapping it in a transaction will make it a bit faster. 
 **UPDATE**

 
 What if i want to insert unique names?  
 
 If you want to insert unique names, then you need to generate data with unique names.  One way to do this is to use Visual Studio  to generate test data . 
 
 By the way why don't you use XML data insertion through Stored Procedure? 
 Here is the link to do that...
 Inserting Bulk Data through XML-Stored Procedure 
 
 Using a @Aaron Bertrand idea ( ), this is something that will create 1000 records : 
 
 See  **SQLFIDDLE**

 
 
 
 Simplest way.  
 Just stop execution in 10 sec.
