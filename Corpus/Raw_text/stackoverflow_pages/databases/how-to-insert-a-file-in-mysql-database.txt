*** how-to-insert-a-file-in-mysql-database ***

 I want to insert a file in MYSQL database residing on a remote webserver using a webservice. 
 My question is: What type of table column (e.g. varchar, etc.) will store a file? And will the insert statement be somewhat different in case of a file? 
 
 The BLOB datatype is best for storing files. 
 
 See:  How to store .pdf files into MySQL as BLOBs using PHP? 
 The MySQL  BLOB reference manual  has some interesting comments  
 
 
 File size by MySQL type: 
 
 **TINYBLOB**
 255 bytes =  **0.000255 Mb**

 **BLOB**
 65535 bytes =  **0.0655 Mb**

 **MEDIUMBLOB**
 16777215 bytes =  **16.78 Mb**

 **LONGBLOB**
 4294967295 bytes =  **4294.97 Mb**
 = 4.295 Gb 
 
 
 You need to use BLOB, there's TINY, MEDIUM, LONG, and just BLOB, as with other types, choose one according to your size needs. 
 
 The insert statement would be fairly normal. You need to read the file using   and then   to it. 
 
 The other answers will give you a good idea how to accomplish what you have asked for.... 
 However 
 There are not many cases where this is a good idea.  It is usually better to store only the filename in the database and the file on the file system. 
 That way your database is much smaller, can be transported around easier and more importantly is quicker to backup / restore.
