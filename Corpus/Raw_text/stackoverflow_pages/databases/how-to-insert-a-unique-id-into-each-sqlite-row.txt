*** how-to-insert-a-unique-id-into-each-sqlite-row ***

 I have the following SQLite code. How do I insert an auto generating unique ID into each row? 
 
 
 You could define   as an  auto increment column : 
 
 As MichaelDorner notes, the  SQLite documentation  says that an   does the same thing and is slightly faster. A column of that type is an alias for  , which  behaves like an autoincrement column . 
 
 This behavior is implicit and could catch inexperienced SQLite developers off-guard. 
 
 This is the syntax that I use. 
 
 Simply don't provide data for the autoincrement column 
 
 Or even simpler 
 
 
  is your friend buddy. 
 
 and then: 
 
 
 for the INSERT, better provide a "null" value for the corresponding autoincrement value's question mark placeholder. 
 
 
 This worked perfectly for me
