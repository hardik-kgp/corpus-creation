 I have three answers to this question: 
 
 It is against  **user experience**
 UX best practice to use BLOB and CLOB data types in string and retrieving binary data from an SQL database thus it is advised that you use the technique that involves storing the URL for the image( or any Binary file in the database). This URL will help the user application to retrieve and use this binary file. 
 Second the BLOB and CLOB data types are only available to a number of SQL versions thus functions such as LOAD_FILE or the datatypes themselves could miss in some versions. 
 Third DON'T USE BLOB OR CLOB. Store the URL; let the user application access the binary file from a folder in the project directory. 
 
 
 If I use the following query, 
 
 Error: no such function: LOAD_FILE 
 
 I tried all above solution and fail, it just added a null file to the DB.  
 However, I was able to get it done by moving the image( ) file first in to below folder(in my case)   and then I executed below command and it works for me, 
 
 Hope this helps.
