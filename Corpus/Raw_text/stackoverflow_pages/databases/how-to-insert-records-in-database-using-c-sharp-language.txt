*** how-to-insert-records-in-database-using-c-sharp-language ***

 I am just a begginer on C# so i need too much help. Now the problem is that i have designed a windows form in which there are many fields like first name, last name, address etc. Now i want to do is that when i fill the form and click insert button all the information goes into database. Does anyone know how to do that? 
 
 
 There are many problems in your query. 
This is a modified version of your code 
 
 
 The column names contain spaces (this should be avoided) thus you
need square brackets around them 
 You need to use the   statement to be sure that the connection
will be closed and resources released  
 You put the controls directly in the string, but this don't work 
 You need to use a parametrized query to avoid quoting problems and
sqlinjiection attacks 
 No need to use a DataAdapter for a simple insert query 
 Do not use AddWithValue because it could be a source of bugs (See link below) 
 
 Apart from this, there are other potential problems. What if the user doesn't input anything in the textbox controls? Do you have done any checking on this before trying to insert?
As I have said the fields names contain spaces and this will cause inconveniences in your code. Try to change those field names. 
 This code assumes that your database columns are of type NVARCHAR, if not, then use the appropriate  SqlDbType enum  value. 
 Please plan to switch to a more recent version of NET Framework as soon as possible. The 1.1 is really obsolete now. 
 And, about AddWithValue problems, this article explain why we should avoid it.  Can we stop using AddWithValue() already? 
 
 You should change your code to make use of  **SqlParameters**
 and adapt your insert statement to the following  
 
 
 Use a parameterized query to prevent Sql injections (secutity problem) 
 Use the using statement so the connection will be closed and resources will be disposed. 
 
 
 You should form the command with the contents of the textboxes: 
 
 This, of course, provided that you manage to open the connection correctly. 
 It would be helpful to know what's happening with your current code. If you are getting some error displayed in that message box, it would be great to know what it's saying. 
 You should also validate the inputs before actually running the command (i.e. make sure they don't contain malicious code...). 
 
 
 (Firt Name)  is not a valid field. It should be FirstName or First_Name. It may be your problem.
