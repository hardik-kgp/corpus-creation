*** how-to-insert-special-characters-into-a-database ***

 Can anyone tell me how to insert special characters into a MySQL database? I've made a PHP script which is meant to insert some words into a database, although if the word contains a ' then it wont be inserted.   
 I can insert the special characters fine when using PHPmyAdmin, but it just doesn't work when inserting them via PHP. Could it be that PHP is changing the special characters into something else? If so, is there a way to make them insert properly?

 Note that as others have pointed out mysql_real_escape_string() will solve the problem (as will addslashes), however  **you should always use mysql_real_escape_string()**
