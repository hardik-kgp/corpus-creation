*** how-to-install-a-sql-file-using-mysql-command-line-client ***

 I need to install or import a .sql file into an empty database that I've created. The .sql file will install all the tables etc.  
 When I click MySQL Command line Client prompt, I add my credentials and then...(to install / import the .sql file)?

enjoy...
