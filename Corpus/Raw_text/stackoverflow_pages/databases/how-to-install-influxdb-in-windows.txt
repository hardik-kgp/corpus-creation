*** how-to-install-influxdb-in-windows ***

 I am new to InfluxDB. I could not find any details about installing InfluxDB on Windows. Is there any way to install it on a Windows machine or do I need to use a Linux server for development purposes? 
 
 The current 0.9 branch of influxdb is pure go and can be compiled on Windows with the following commands: 
 
 Of course you will need go (>1.4), git and hg. 
 If you do not want to compile your own version, you can also find here my own Windows x86 binaries for v0.9.0-rc11:
 https://github.com/adriencarbonne/influxdb/releases/download/v0.9.0-rc11/influxdb_v0.9.0-rc11.zip 
 To run InfluxDB, type:  . 
 Or even better, create the following config file, save it as   and run  : 
 
 
 I struggled quite a lot with this issue, so I'll post the full process  **step by step**
. This will hopefully help other people that lands on this post.

 Edit: WARNING, this doesn't work if Go and projects folder are installed to a custom path (not c:\go). In this case go get breaks with cryptic messages about unrecognized import paths (thanks to user626528 for the info)

 **1. PREVIOUS DOWNLOADS**

 Go for Windows (get the .msi):
 https://golang.org/dl/ 
 GIT for Windows:
 http://git-scm.com/download/win 
 
 **2. COMPILATION**

 cd to  C:\Go 
 Create our  $GOPATH  in  "C:\Go\projects"  (anywhere but  C:\Go\src , which is the  $GOROOT ). 
 
 Set to  $GOPATH  variable to this new directory: 
 
 Pull the influxdb code from github into our  $GOPATH : 
 
 cd to  C:\Go\projects\github.com\influxdata\influxdb 
 Pull the project dependencies: 
 
 Finally, build the code: 
 
 ...this will create 3 executables under  C:\Go\projects\bin : 
 
 
 **3. EXECUTION**

 To start the service: 
 
 For that, you first need to create a  **influxdb.conf**
 file with the following text: 
 
 Once the service is started, you can execute Chrome and go to  http://localhost:8083 , and start playing with InfluxDb. 
 Default values for username and password are: 
 
 
 Few updates to  Xavier PeÃ±a  solution to build latest influxdb. Notice the difference in github URL and the path. 
 
 
 Windows if officially supported. Go to  https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads  and download it from there. 
 
 The current 0.9 branch of influxdb is pure go and can be compiled on Windows. The main prerequisites are go 1.4, git (e.g. tortoisegit together with msysgit), hg (e.g. tortoisehg). 
 Using this setup I've successfully compiled and run influxdb on Win7 x64. 
 
 There wasn't an influxdb Windows version at Sep 30 '14, there were are only Linux and OSX versions. 
 Update: Current 0.9 version at present 04/09/2015 have a win version.  
 
 The  "nightlies" build  actually has windows executables now. The release version does not (there is  an open issue  for that). 
 Alternatively, downloading the released version and adding the .exe extension to the file names should work as well. You would have to generate the config file using the command: 
 
 
 We don't officially support Windows at this time. However, you should now be able to build from master. See this issue to track it closely and the comments at the bottom have a link to where you can get a compiled binary:
 https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/5359 
 
 For create influxdb configuration file we can also use the below command 
 
 
 If you don't want to compile it yourself, the build is done by influxdata and can be found at URLs like :  https://dl.influxdata.com/influxdb/releases/influxdb-1.0.0-beta2_windows_amd64.zip  (just change the version number to have another (recent) version) 
 However, as mentionned by Paul Dix, Windows is not officially supported for the moment.  
 
 go to influxdata.com click downloads
 https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ 
 select version 1.7 . because currently there are no binaries for 2.0 .
download windows binnary 
 
 **Update 2020 - InfluxDB is NOT recommended on windows**

 After going through countless of articles, it is generally  **NOT recommended**
 to install InfluxDB directly on Windows. There are many issues. In terms of performance and stability. Official InfluxDB too does not support windows and has no plans for it in the future. This is further proven as the latest InfluxDB 2.0 does not include any windows binaries. 
 
 InfluxDB 2.0 does not include windows binaries 
 
 so? 
 **Work Around? => DOCKERS for WINDOWS, Try it, it's easy and free**

 Dockers are free. If you intend to install docker on Windows Server, it's also free for Windows Server 2016 and above (Microsoft made a special deal with docker to provide them for free) 
 For those who are still in the VM world: 
 
 Dockers are  **NOT**
 like Virtual Machines. It interacts directly with the host's file system via a windows service
