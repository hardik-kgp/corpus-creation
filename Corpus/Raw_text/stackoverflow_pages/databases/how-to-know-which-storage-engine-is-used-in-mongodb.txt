 Starting from version 3.0, mongodb support pluggable storage engine. How to know which storage engine is being used in a system? 
 
 Easiest way to find the storage engine being used currently. 
 Inside mongo console type  
 
 It returns  
 
 Once it is confirmed that wiredTiger is being used then type

On the other hand, by using MongoDB GUI like  MongoChef  or  Robomongo  storageEngine may be found by using the ways below; 
 On  ; 
 
 
 On  ; 
 
 
 You can detect this via: 
 
 So at "present" where this "exists" then there is a different storage engine configured other than the default "MMAPv1" where "WiredTiger" is not used. 
 This applies to the present "MongoDB 3.0x" series
