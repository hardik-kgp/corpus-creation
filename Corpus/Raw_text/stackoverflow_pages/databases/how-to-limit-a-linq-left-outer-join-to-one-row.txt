*** how-to-limit-a-linq-left-outer-join-to-one-row ***

 I have a left outer join (below) returning results as expected. I need to limit the results from the 'right' table to the 'first' hit. Can I do that somehow? Currently, I get a result for every record in both tables, I only want to see one result from the table on the left (items) no matter how many results I have in the right table (photos). 
 
 
 This will do the job for you. 
 
 I got this sql when I generated it against my own model (and without the name and second id columns in the projection). 
 
 When I asked for the plan, it showed that the subquery is implemented by this join: 
 
 
 What you want to do is group the table.  The best way to do this is: 
 
 
 Edit:  This is Amy B speaking.  I'm only doing this because Nick asked me to.  Nick, please modify or remove this section as you feel is appropriate. 
 The SQL generated is quite large.  The int 0 (to be compared with the count) is passed in via parameter. 
 
 The execution plan reveals three left joins.  At least one is trivial and should not be counted (it brings in the zero).  There is enough complexity here that I cannot clearly point to any problem for efficiency.  It might run great. 
 
 You could do something like: 
 
 Around the last part of the query. Not sure if it will work or what kind of wack SQL it will produce  :) 
 
 Use an inner query. Include   for the case of no photo and   for the case of more than one. The following example takes the photo with the greatest  . 
 
 If you need to handle the case of no photo specially, you can omit   and use  /  instead.
