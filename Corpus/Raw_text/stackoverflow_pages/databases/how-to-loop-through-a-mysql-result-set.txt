*** how-to-loop-through-a-mysql-result-set ***

 What are some different ways to loop through a mysql result set? I'm new to PHP and MySQL so I'm looking for simple ways to loop through and an explanation as to how the provided code works. 
 
 Here is a full example: 
 http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-result.fetch-array.php 
 
 Connect 
 Select database 
 Make query 
 Cycle on the result and fetch array to get the row 
 
 
 the first example that comes to my mind: 
 
 
 
 
 
 If you are using MySQL versions 4.1.3 or later,  it is strongly recommended  that you use the  **mysqli**
 extension instead [of the  **mysql**
 extension that is not further developed, does not support features of MySQL 4.1+, no prepared and multiple statements, has no object-oriented interface, ...] 
 
 see  mysqli-stmt.fetch  for the procedural and object oriented ways to loop over a mysqli result set. 
 
 I'd recommend creating a database function that acts as a wrapper for your database fetch.  Makes it easier to switch out database function calls, and even, down the road, the type of database itself (e.g. mysql->postgresql or mysql->couchdb or using the PDO object or something). 
 Some function that -you- create that takes a query and returns a fully associative array, and then you stick the database connection code inside there. 
 It may also be good to check into using  PDO  down the road, since it abstracts away database specific functions for you, working with mysql, postgresql, etc.
