 This is my pojo annotated as entity 
 
 etc...... 
 the above entity is created using annotation, when i look to the mysql database,the columns are not created in the order, i have written below, instead , first columns is the book_id, then book_desc, then book_athor, then book_short_desc then book_name. 
 my question is how can i tell hibernate to create the columns the same order as i have written in the java code ?? 
 is there any annotation for that ?? 
 regards 
 
 Assuming you mean the database tables are generated via   being set to   or similar,  there is no way to specify the order of the columns   at least in 2008, according to one member of the Hibernate team . 
 My advice would be to create the database via separately maintained database scripts (possibly in conjunction with a script deployment/migration tool such as  Flyway  and perhaps also with   to check the resulting schema matches the entities). Maintaining the database via scripts becomes much more necessary once the application goes into production.
