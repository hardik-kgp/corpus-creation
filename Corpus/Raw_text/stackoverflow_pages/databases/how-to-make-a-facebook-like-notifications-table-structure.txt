*** how-to-make-a-facebook-like-notifications-table-structure ***

 I am making a social app like Facebook using   and  . It has a notifications button at the top similar to Facebook. When someone posts in a group or someone from your friend list is going to any event or if someone sends you an add request then how should I manage these notifications in database? 
 Like :
I joined a group "A". Someone from "A" group will post in the group then a notification should be sent to each user of the group. How could I manage notification table in this case? 
 I am planning to have a table structure as given below: 
 
 user_id  |  Type_of_notification  |  notication_text | sender_id |
  Created_time | 
 
 Is my approach right? 
 
 You are effectively building an activity stream in MySQL. There is an excellent answer at  How to implement the activity stream in a social network . I've used it myself in a smaller app, but the comments in there show that it easily scales up to quite a few million rows too. 
 
 You can see facebook's 'notification' table structure for fql which can give you better idea about your table. 
 These can be some of your columns:
