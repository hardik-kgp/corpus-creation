*** how-to-open-close-sqlite-db-in-android-properly ***

 I have an app that functions properly and does not force close or crash.  But when I look at LogCat, it occasionally gives me this: 
 
 a little ways down... 
 
 I am not sure when I should be opening and closing my Database? 
 I have a Main activity that is simply a splash screen.  It then goes into an activity that calls a ListView using info from the DB; so it is at  this  activity where the DB is first opened.  
 There is also one other Activity where the DB is required that branches off the one with the ListVeew.  When am I supposed to be opening and closing this?  Word seems to be that I simply need to open once, and then close when the app is "paused", "stopped" or "destroyed". 
 If this is the case, where do I put the db.close() method... in the Splash Screen Main Activity where onStop, etc is located? or the same Activity as the one that opens the DB?  or.. is there another place? 
 UPDATE: 
 This is the line in code that the error keeps pointing to: 
 
 
 If you're using an instance of a DatabaseHelper class, and after you initialize the DBHelper object, every time you do work in the database you should call the open method before you do work, then create a new cursor, query the database, do work with the information you just stored in the cursor, when you're done close the cursor, then close the database. For example if you wanted to grab every item in a database you would do something like : 
 
  is a public method in my  , it looks like this in case you were wondering 
 
 This is how I access my database and I haven't gotten any of the errors you've got, and it works perfectly. 
 
 I used to do the way @Shikima mentioned above but in complex applications which has many background services, multi-threading,etc it can get real tiresome when you have to manage many database instances and on top of that, opening and closing them. 
 To overcome this, I used the following method and it seems to be working fine. 
 **1.**

 Declare and initialize an instance of  **YourDBHelperClass**
 in your  Application  base class like this : 
 
 **2.**

 In you activity, or any other place you want to use the DB, initialize the YourDBHelperClass object like this : 
 
 And then you can use the database anyway you want without having to worry about opening and closing it manually each time. The  SQLiteOpenHelper  takes care of the closing when the Application is destroyed 
 
 You are probably not handling your database correctly; you are opening more database instances than you are closing.  
 There are a number of design patterns you can follow to correct this behavior. You might want to consult  this answer  for more information.
