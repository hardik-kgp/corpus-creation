*** how-to-open-multiple-sql-files-in-only-one-ssms-instance ***

 I'm DBA with a new server box running Windows Server 2008 Enterprise SP1 with SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server Management Studio. 
 In my previous box when working in Visual Studio with database solution with lot of .sql files I used to double-click on the .sql files and they were opened in the same SSMS instance (if any already opened). However (even when having exactly the same installation in the new box) I'm now getting a new SSMS instance when double clicking in each sql file. Its really painful one .sql - one SSMS instance so I started my research about that. 
 What I've tried till now: 
 1) Right click on the .sql file > "Open With" option > "Add" option > "Program Name: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Tools\Binn\VSShell\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe" and "Friendly Name: SQL" > "Ok" > "Set as Default". Does NOT work. Still having one sql - one ssms instance. 
 2) Perfomed Run > regedit > and modify the value data of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\sqlwb.sql.9.0\Shell\Open\Command  and replace /dde with "%1". DOES NOT WORK 
 3) Right click on the .sql file > "Open With" option > "Add" option > "Programe Name: explorer.exe" and "Friendly Name: Explorer" > "Ok" > "Set as default". Does NOT work. When double-clicking on the .sql files Notepad comes with scripts content. 
 4) Some pages like this

 asks to change file association but when opening Windows Explorer > Tools > Folder Options ... I found there is no "File Type" tab. How annoying! 
 Can someone help me on that? My patient it's really running out. 
 Thanks in advance 
 
 After spending most of my working day looking for the solution I finally found it. Thanks God, I was almost running out with this issue. Hope it helps somebody else!!!.  
 Update: linked domain expired, so here's what it said: 
 
 Considering how integrated Microsoft tools usually are the result is
  frustrating when you tell Visual Studio to open SQL files using Sql
  Server Management Studio (SSMS). I really don't like using Visual
  Studio to edit T-SQL files but in the past, before I discovered this
  tip, each SQL file I opened would open in a new instance of SSMS. Try
  it: 
 
 Open a solution which contains SQL files 
 Right-click any SQL file and select “Open With…” 
 Click “Add” 
 Browse to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Tools\Binn\VSShell\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe" or if you're
  running x64 Windows "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL
  Server\100\Tools\Binn\VSShell\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe", then click “OK” 
 Click “Set as Default” and then “OK” 
 
 Now open multiple SQL files. Each time you'll get a different instance
  of SSMS opened. What a pain! 
 NOTE: This entire article applies to SQL 2005, just replace SSMS with
  SQLWB. 
 How do you resolve this? Repeat steps 1-3 above, but at step #4 enter
  the following values: 
 
 Program Name: “explorer.exe” 
 Friendly Name: “Windows Explorer” 
 
 Repeat step #5 (set as default) above and then click OK. Now, open
  additional files. They should all open in the same instance of SSMS. 
 It would seem that Visual Studio issues a command to SSMS.exe which
  includes the path of the file selected in the solution explorer. It is
  up to SSMS to check for a new instance, which it doesn't. But when you
  pass the file name to explorer it gets opened up in the same instance. 
 QUIRK WARNING! 
 If SSMS is not already open, the first file you attempt to open (not
  first time ever, but every time you open an SQL file from Visual
  Studio and SSMS isn't open yet) SSMS will open, but your file will
  not. Click the file a 2nd time and it will open the file this time.
  Don't ask me to explain it it just is (and I have no idea why).
  Conclusion 
 The result when you tell Visual Studio that SSMS is the default editor
  makes sense, but I don't get why it would be different when you tell
  explorer to open it. Maybe if I were a Windows developer instead of a
  web developer I would know the answer. But either way, now you know.
  Enjoy. 
 
 
 I have this problem before, I found there is a simple solution -> just check if your SSMS is under "Run this program as an administrator" option (right click on the shortcut icon -> property -> Compability -> Privilege level). If yes, untick the option and try double click the sql file. 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 Similar issues have been reported multiple times, but they aren't addressing the issue:

 Did you install Visual Studio (or any Visual Studio components)  after  installing SQL Server? 
 My guess is that the Connect items will not be fixed - SQL will blame Visual Studio, Visual Studio will blame SQL, and the items will remain open... 
 So here is what I suggest: run a  repair  of SQL Server from Programs and Features and then re-apply the latest service pack of SQL Server 2008 (SP2). 
 Also the "File Types" interface was moved from the Tools / Folder Options interface to the Control Panel. Go into Control Panel > Default Programs > "Associate a file type or protocol with a program." However it doesn't seem to have the options here to add command-line options like "%1" or /dde. 
 
 Try adding these reg keys as well, but make sure you put the /dde back in: 
 
 For the record, here is my entire export for that section: 
 
 
 Go to Tools >> Folder Options >> File Types and apply below settings. It worked for me finally!!! (after half a day search on google). 
 
 Click New/Edit (on this window "Confirm open after download"  should be check and "Always show extension" should be unchecked) 
 In next window, make below entries

 I am using SQL Server Management Studio 2012 Express and I have made this to work by pointing "Program" to "explorer.exe" 
 This is how my register is set up: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\ssms.exe" /dde 
 at 
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ssms.sql.11.0\Shell\Open\Command 
 
 I've 2005 & 2008 SSMS installed so I defaulted to the 2005 instance. If I have 2008 ssms open when opening a .sql file from windows explorer it will now open in the existing 2008 ssms (and not try to open a new instance!) 
 
 From Windows Explorer, one can drag-and-drop selected files (single or multiple) into an SSMS window. 
 
 One thing to check is if you have multiple versions of SSMS.  If you happen to be working in an older version, double clicking on a file will open the new SSM version. Or whatever the default version is for sql files.
