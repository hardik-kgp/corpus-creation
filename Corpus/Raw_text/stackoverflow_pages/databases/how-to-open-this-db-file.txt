 I have a few database files with .db extension and I want to take a peek. However I don't know what program should I use to open the files. I've found a similar quesiton that says checking the header of the db file could reveal the name of the database-program/type.
What I've found is "FLDB".
Anyone have any clue what kind of database file can this be? 
 Edit: 
 Trying to give more hint:
This is a program of a car navigation system and it knows 8 languages. I'm trying to localize it to my language. There are lots of .db and two .gdb files witch (probably) contains this data. 
 
 I don't think there is a way to tell which program to use from just the .db extension. It could even be an encrypted database which can't be opened. You can MS Access, or a sqlite manager. 
 **Edit:**

Try to rename the file to .txt and open it with a text editor. The first couple of words in the file could tell you the DB Type. 
 If it is a SQLite database, it will start with "SQLite format 3" 
 
 You can use a tool like the  TrIDNet - File Identifier  to look for the  Magic Number  and other telltales, if the file format is in it's database it may tell you what it is for. 
 However searching the definitions did not turn up anything for the string "FLDB", but it checks more than magic numbers so it is worth a try. 
 If you are using Linux  File  is a command that will do a similar task. 
 The other thing to try is if you have access to the program that generated this file, there may be DLL's or EXE's from the database software that may contain meta information about the dll's creator which could give you a starting point for looking for software that can read the file outside of the program that originally created the   file.
