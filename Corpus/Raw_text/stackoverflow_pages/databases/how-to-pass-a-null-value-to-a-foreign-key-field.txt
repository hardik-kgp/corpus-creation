 How to keep    **NULL**
 in user table? 
 I am writting only 1 query, my query is: 
 
 Here   can be null from front end. 
  table will be set bydefault by me.   
 In the front end, student will select the university name, according to that the   will pass to   table, but if student is not selecting any university name then is should pass null value to the   table for   field.  
 
 Just allow column   of table   to allow   value so you can save  nulls .
