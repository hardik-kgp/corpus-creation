*** how-to-pass-data-frame-for-update-with-r-dbi ***

 With  RODBC , there were functions like   that allowed you pass   instead of having to construct your own SQL string. 
 However, with R's  DBI , all I see are functions like   which only take a string   and gives no opportunity to specify a   directly. 
 So how to   using a   with DBI? 
 
 Really late, my answer, but maybe still helpful... 
 There is no single function (I know) in the DBI/odbc package but you can replicate the update behavior using a prepared update statement (which should work faster than RODBC's   since it sends the parameter values as a batch to the SQL server: 
 
 This works only if you have a primary key which I created in the above example by using the row names which are a unique number increased by one for each row... 
 For more information about the   package I have used in the DBI   statement see:  https://github.com/rstats-db/odbc
