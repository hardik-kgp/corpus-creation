 From  the docs : 
 
 You can also chain multiple where() methods to create more specific queries (logical AND). 
 
 How can I perform an   query?
Example:  
 
 Give me all documents where the field   is   OR  
 Give me all documents where the field   OR  
 
 
  isn't supported as it's hard for the server to scale it (requires keeping state to dedup). The work around is to issue 2 queries, one for each condition, and dedup on the client. 
 
 you can bind two Observables using the rxjs merge operator.
Here you have an example. 
 
 Then you can subscribe to the new Observable updates using the above method: 
 
 I hope this can help you, greetings from Chile!! 
 
 I would have no "status" field, but status related fields, updating them to true or false based on request, like  
 
 However, check Firebase Cloud Functions. You could have a function listening status changes, updating status related properties like 
 
 one or the other, your query could be just 
 
 Hope it helps. 
 
 With the  recent addition of IN queries , Firestore supports "up to 10 equality clauses on the same field with a logical  **OR**
" 
 A possible solution to (1) would be: 
 
 See  Firebase Guides: Query Operators |   and  
 
 suggest to give value for status as well. 
 ex. 
 
 
 you can query by    then both   and   will found. 
 this can save your query cost and performance. 
 btw, it is not fix all case. 
 
 We have the same problem just now, luckily the only possible values for ours are A,B,C,D (4) so we have to query for things like A||B, A||C, A||B||C, D, etc 
 
 As of like a few months ago firebase supports a new query   so what we do is make an array and we pre-process the OR values to the array 
 
 And we do this for all   values or however many combos there are.  
 THEN we can simply check the query   or whatever type of condition we need. 
 So if something only qualified for conditional   of our 4 conditionals (A,B,C,D) then its array would contain the following literal strings:  
 Then for any of those   combinations we can just search   on whatever we may want (e.g. "A||C") 
 
 Note: This is only a reasonable approach if you have a few number of possible values to compare OR with.  
 More info on  Array-contains here , since it's newish to firebase docs 
 
 OR isn't supported   
 But if you need that you can do It in your code  
 Ex : if i want query products where ( **Size**
 Equal Xl OR XXL : AND  **Gender**
 is Male)
