*** how-to-perform-one-time-db-sync-to-another-db-in-mongodb ***

 I have separate development and production MongoDB servers and I want to keep actual data in development server for sometime. What I should use for it:  mongodump ,  mongoimport  or something else? 
 Clarification : I want to copy data from production to development. 
 
 You can use the   or   commands:

 This is faster than mongodump / mongorestore because it skips creating the bson representation on disk. 
 
 **If it's a one time-thing**

 and you want fine control over parameters such as which collections to sync, you should use: 
 
 **mongodump**
 to dump bson files of your Production DB to your local machine 
 **mongorestore**
 to then, retrieve the dumped BSON files in your Local DB 
 
 
 **Otherwise you should check out **
**mongo-sync**

 It's a script I wrote for my self when I had to constantly copy my Local   database to and from my Production DB for a Project (I know it's stupid). 
 Once you put your DB details in  , you can start syncing using two simple commands: 
 
 If you use it inside some project, it's a good idea to add   to  
 
 
 When you want the dev database to look exactly like the production database, you can just copy the files. I am currently running a setup where I synchronize my MongoDB database between my desktop and my notebook with dropbox - even that works flawless.
