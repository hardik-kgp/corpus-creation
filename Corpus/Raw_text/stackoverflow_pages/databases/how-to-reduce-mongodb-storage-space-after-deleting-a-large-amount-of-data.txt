 I have a database in MongoDB, called dump. Currently, it reached 6GB in my server. I decided to delete 90% of data in this database to reduce the disk space it occupied. But after doing that its size is still 6GB, while the true storage size is only 250MB. 
 I guess this is the design of MongoDB? Is there any convinient way to reduce its size? Thank in advance.

 To compress the data files, you can run either start up MongoDB with  , or connect to the database through the shell and run  . 
 There's also a new  compact  command scheduled for v1.9 that will do in-place compaction.
