*** how-to-remove-foreign-key-constraint-in-sql-server ***

 I want to remove foreign key from another table so i can insert values of my choice. 
 I am new in databases so please tell me correct sql query to drop or remove foreign key value. 
 
 Try following 
 
 Refer :  http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_foreignkey.asp 
 
 Its wrong to do that in refer to  referential integrity , because once its broken its not easy to turn it on again without having to go through the records and delete the ones which breaks the constraints. 
 Anyway the Syntax is as follows: 
 
 See MSDN: 
 
 Delete Primary Keys 
 Delete Foreign Key Relationships 
 
 
 To remove all the constraints from the DB: 
 
 
 
 But, be careful man, once you do that, you may never get a chance back, and you should read some basic database book see why we need foreign key   
 
 Depending on the  **DB**
 you are using there's a syntax or another. 
 If you're using  **Oracle**
 you have to put what the other users told you: 
 
 But if you use  **MySQL**
 then this will give you a syntax error, instead you can type: 
 
 
 Drop all the foreign keys of a table: 
 
 
 
 EDIT: didn't notice you were using sql-server, my bad 
 
 
 You should consider (temporarily) disabling the constraint before you completely delete it. 
 If you look at the table creation TSQL you will see something like: 
 
 You can run 
 
 ... then insert/update a bunch of values that violate the constraint, and then turn it back on by running the original   statement. 
 (I have had to do this to cleanup poorly designed systems I've inherited in the past.) 
 
 Use those queries to find all FKs: 
 
 
 Alternatively, you can also delete a Foreign Key Constraint from the SQL Server Management Studio itself.  You can try it if the commands do not work . 
 
 Expand your database view. 
 Right Click on Table which has foreign key constraint. Choose Design. A tab with the information about table columns will open. 
 Right click on the column which has the foreign key reference. Or you can right click on any column. Choose Relationships. 
 A list of relationships will appear (if you have one) in a pop up window. 
 From there you can delete the foreign key constraint. 
 
 I hope that helps 
 
 If you don't know foreign key constraint name then try this to find it. 
 
 additionally for different schema 
 
 then  
 
 
 firstly use  
 
 to see the descriptive structure of your table. 
 There you may see constraints respective to foreign keys you used in that table.
First delete the respective constraint with  
 
 and then delete the respective foreign keys or column you wanted...GoodLuck!! 
 
 
 Foreign key constraint will be removed.
