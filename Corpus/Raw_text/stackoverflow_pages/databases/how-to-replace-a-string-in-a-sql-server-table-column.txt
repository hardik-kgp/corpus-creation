*** how-to-replace-a-string-in-a-sql-server-table-column ***

 I have a table ( ) which references paths (  or otherwise), but now the path is going to change.  
 In the path column, I have many records and I need to change just a portion of the path, but not the entire path. And I need to change the same string to the new one, in every record.

  "tblMyTable" is my table in database. 
 
 
 If target column type is other than varchar/nvarchar like  **text**
, we need to cast the column value as string and then convert it as: 
 
 
 you need to replace path with the help of replace function. 
 
 here   refers to that column which you want to change. 
 Hope it will work.
