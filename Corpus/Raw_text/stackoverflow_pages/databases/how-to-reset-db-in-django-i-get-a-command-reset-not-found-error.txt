*** how-to-reset-db-in-django-i-get-a-command-reset-not-found-error ***

 Following this Django by Example tutotrial here:  http://lightbird.net/dbe/todo_list.html 
 The tutorial says: 
 
 "This changes our table layout and weâ€™ll have to ask Django to reset
  and recreate tables: 
 " 
 
 though, when I run  , I get the error: 
 
 Is this because I am using sqlite3 and not postgresql? 
 **Can somebody tell me what the command is to reset the database?**

 The command:   returns the error: 
 
 So I added 'todo' to my INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py, and ran   again, resulting in this error: 
 
 
  has been replaced by   with Django 1.5, see:
 
 
 
 It looks like the 'flush' answer will work for some, but not all cases.  I needed not just to flush the values in the database, but to recreate the tables properly.  I'm not using migrations yet (early days) so I really needed to drop all the tables.   
 Two ways I've found to drop all tables, both require something other than core django. 
 If you're on Heroku, drop all the tables with pg:reset: 
 
 If you can install Django Extensions, it has a way to do a complete reset:   
 
 
 Similar to LisaD's answer,  Django Extensions  has a great reset_db command that totally drops everything, instead of just truncating the tables like "flush" does. You have to specify a router, so it may look like: 
 
 Merely flushing the tables wasn't fixing a persistent error that occurred when I was deleting objects. Doing a reset_db fixed the problem. 
 
 if you are using Django 2.0
Then 
 
 will work 
 
 If you want to clean the whole database, you can use:
 **python manage.py flush**

If you want to clean database table of a Django app, you can use:
 **python manage.py migrate appname zero**

 
 With django 1.11, simply delete all migration files from the   folder of each application (all files except  ). Then 
 
 Manually drop database. 
 Manually create database. 
 Run  . 
 Run  . 
 
 And voilla, your database has been completely reset. 
 
 For me this solved the problem. 
 
 
 Just a follow up to  @LisaD's  answer. 
As of 2016 ( ), you need to type: 
 
 This will give you a fresh new database within Heroku. 
 
 
 Just manually delete you database. Ensure you create backup first (in my case  **db.sqlite3**
 is my database) 
 Run this command  
 
 
 
 deleted old db contents,  
 Don't forget to create new superuser:
