*** how-to-reset-password-for-root-in-arangodb ***

 I'm root and
I forgot it
What can I do now? 
 I tried to reinstall arangodb, remove all databases but after new installation old password still exist 
 
 
 and then 
 
 
 Start the server   with the option  . This will disable authentication, so that you can access the databases without password. If you are asked for credentials in arangosh or the web interface, use   as username and a blank password. You can then change the password of user   (in the web interface: USERS > root > Change Password). 
 It is advisable to bind the server to   and not   with authentication turned off, so that no one from outside can access the unprotected database, but only you locally on the server (you can also bind it to a network address, but make sure that the port is not open to the public in that case). 
 
 I'm running ArangoDB3 as a service on Ubuntu, and I wasn't able to figure out how to pass the   or   parameters to the   process.  
 I made it work by changing the same values in  /etc/arangodb3/arangod.conf .
