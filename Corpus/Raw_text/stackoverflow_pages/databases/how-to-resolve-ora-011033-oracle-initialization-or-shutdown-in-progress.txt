 This error can also occur in the normal situation when a database is starting or stopping. Normally on startup you can wait until the startup completes, then connect as usual. If the error persists, the  service  (on a Windows box) may be started without the  database  being started. This may be due to startup issues, or because the service is not configured to automatically start the database. In this case you will have to connect as sysdba and physically start the database using the "startup" command. 
 
 I used a combination of the answers from rohancragg, Mukul Goel, and NullSoulException from above. However I had an additional error:  
 ORA-01157: cannot identify/lock data file string - see DBWR trace file 
 To which I found the answer here:  http://nimishgarg.blogspot.com/2014/01/ora-01157-cannot-identifylock-data-file.html 
 Incase the above post gets deleted I am including the commands here as well. 
 
 Thanks everyone you saved my day!

 The issue can also be due to lack of hard drive space. The installation will succeed but on startup, oracle won't be able to create the required files and will fail with the same above error message.

 There was a problem because the database was not open.
Command startup opens the database. 
 This you can solve with command   
in some case with   
 
 
 I faced the same problem. I restarted the oracle service for that DB instance and the error is gone.
