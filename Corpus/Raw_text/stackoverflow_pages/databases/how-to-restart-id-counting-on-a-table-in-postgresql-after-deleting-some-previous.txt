*** how-to-restart-id-counting-on-a-table-in-postgresql-after-deleting-some-previous ***

 I'm using PostgreSQL database on Rails 2.3.8 and I need to restart auto increment ID on my table. How can I do that? 
 
 You can do it directly in PostgreSQL using "alter sequence":  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-altersequence.html 
 Particularly "restart with" 
 I don't know how you would do it via the rails abstraction. 
 
 If you truncate the table you can use the RESTART IDENTITY clause on the end. 
 Example:  
 
 TRUNCATE DOCUMENTATION 
 
 You could do it in the following way: 
 
 
 Check out  setval 
 
 
 Try:

 You can also use ActiveRecord in Rails. 
 You can easily do it from your rails console by running the following command: 
 
 
 If you want to delete all data from table and want to reset id as well then try below code. 
 
 ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("TRUNCATE TABLE your_table_name
  RESTART IDENTITY") 
 
 But if some relationship is present with table and you want to delete all data from table as well as related table data then try below code. 
 
 ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("TRUNCATE TABLE your_table_name
  RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE") 
 
 Thanks and
please suggest if correction needed.
