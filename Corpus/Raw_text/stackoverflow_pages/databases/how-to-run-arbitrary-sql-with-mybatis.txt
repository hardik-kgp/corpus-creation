*** how-to-run-arbitrary-sql-with-mybatis ***

 I've an application that use mybatis for object persistence. But there are chances I need to run arbitrary sql(from user). Can I do it with mybatis? 
 **Update:**

 I choose to use dbutils (JDBC) to run user-defined sql, but I need a instance of DataSource to create QueryRunner. Is there any way I can get datasource from mybatis? 
 
 I use this utilitary class: 
 
 
 your question is similar to the question of  How to exequte query directly from java code using mybatis? 
 I have already given the answer to that question. But I hope this solution will help you. 
 Mybatis has already this function, but you must use the adapter as follows. 
 
 create an adapter class; 
 
 create typeAlias of class SQLAdapter 
 
 
 
 
 
 put select tag in each object xml where you need to execute the sql directly. 
 
 call this select method like 
 
 
 
 
 
 Things have been all done. you can no longer writer complex sql language in the xml file. Good Luck. 
 
 
 Based on the answers provided, they both are good. But both of them required an   class to be used. 
 Using  Mybatis version 3 , I succeeded using a   to keep and pass the  SQL . 
 See the codes below. 
 in   class 
 
 when invoke the method: 
 
  provides a way that you don't have to define the Class properties, or fields in code, you can use a Map to define it redomly. 
 Thanks. 
 
 Reusable fragment of SQL can be used to create select part of query dynamically. In you mapper pass query as normal parameter: 
 
 In your query just access the parameter using  **${sql}**
 instead of  **#{sql}**
.
Value in parameter sql can be a fully valid sql query or a fragment of sql query.
