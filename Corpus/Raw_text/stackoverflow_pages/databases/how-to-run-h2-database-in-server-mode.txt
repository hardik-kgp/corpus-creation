 Here is the properties for the connection: 
 
 When I run the program I got the following error: 
 
 Thanks, 
 
 As the exception message says, "Database may be already in use". You need to close all other connection(s), to make sure the database is not open in another process concurrently. 
 By the way, don't use AUTO_SERVER=TRUE  and  the server mode at the same time. See the documentation for the  automatic mixed mode . Use either one.  
 I guess you are a bit confused about the different connection modes. I suggest to read  the documentation about the connection modes , to make sure you understand it. 
 
 From command line, 
 
 this will launch an h2 database in server mode: 
 
 open a browser to have an admin GUI 
 
 You can use the following code to run H2 in server mode. 
 
 You can use SQuirrel SQL client ( http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/ ) to connect to you H2 database and look at the tables. 
 
 Create new connection. 
 Select H2 in the driver dropdown menu 
 Set url to your project target folder h2 folder (jdbc:h2:C:\projects\workspace\TestProject\target/h2/ps;AUTO_SERVER=true) 
 Enter user name ("sa") 
 Enter password ("") 
 
 
 Close all the applications that using H2 (web console, etc)
Then add the AUTO_SERVER=TRUE to the end of the location in h2 console and also in java program (which you already have done) 
 
 I was getting this error when trying to start H2.

 Exception in thread "main" org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Feature not
  supported: "-~webAllowOthers" [50100-197] 
 
 So I followed these steps:   
 
 make dir mkdir h2db this directory will have your db files. 
 Hit this command :  
this command will start h2  
 If you want to run h2 in backend then open vi h2.sh and paste this command in this:
 
 Now run ./bin.h2.sh.
