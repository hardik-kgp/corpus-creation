*** how-to-save-a-google-maps-overlay-shape-in-the-database ***

 I want to save a Google maps overlay shape in the database. This is my code. It works perfectly but I just need to save   array in the database. 
 
 Where and how can I save the created overlay shapes in the database. All shapes are saved in the   array. What kind of type I have to choose for the field in database? I mean for example int, char, etc.
I'm going to use MySQL and PHP. 
 
 When you simply want to store the shapes somehow, you may use a JSON-string, store it in e.g. a  -column(  would be to small to store detailed polygons/polylines ) 
 Note: when you create the JSON-string, you must convert the properties(e.g. to native  arrays or objects), you cannot store for example LatLng's directly, because the prototype will be lost when saving it. Pathes of polylines/polygons may be stored  encoded 
 Another approach:
use multiple columns, e.g.  
 
 a column( ) where you store the type(LatLng, Circle,Polyline,etc.) 
 a column( ) where you store the geometric features(LatLng,Polygon or Polyline) 
 a column( ) where you store a radius(used when you insert a circle) 
 optionally column( ) where you store the style-options(when needed) 
 
 The first suggestion would be sufficient when you simply want to store it.  
 When you must be able to select particular shapes, e.g for a given area, use the 2nd suggestion.
See  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/spatial-extensions.html  for details of the spatial extensions 
 
 2 functions that either remove the circular references and create storable objects, or restore the overlays from these stored objects. 
 
 The array returned by   may be sended to a serverside script. The serverside script should iterate over this array and INSERT a JSON-string into the table: 
 
 to restore the shapes fetch them: 
 
 and pass the result to  :

 Simple GeoJson Editor  is an example of drawing, editing, dropping and saving shapes as geoJson on google maps. The author ( a Google intern) described the project in this  post . 
 The  Javascript  and  HTML  are not minified.  
 An even better opensource tool can be found at  Geojson.io 
 
 If you need to store the path just to restore it later on a map, you can also use  Google Maps Encoding Utility . It is not as powerful as Dr.Molle's answer but can be useful for storing polygons and polylines.
