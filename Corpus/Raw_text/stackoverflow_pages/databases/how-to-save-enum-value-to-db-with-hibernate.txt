*** how-to-save-enum-value-to-db-with-hibernate ***

 I tried to fill DB tables with random data and through Hibernate. 
 But my code fill incompatible data into tables (not exactly incompatible it is index of this element declared at enum, for ex: at   -   is first element it set to appropriate column it index - 0. But I want to put or   as enum or as string). 
 I couldn't figure out why exactly this happen. 
 Here is code snippet: 
 
 I need to fill at table some enum values, as rating (2, 3, 4) and sleep places (1, 2..).  
 But this puts some wrong data into table.  
 Here is content at workbench: 
   
 Why it puts only index, not as string or as enum. 
How can I recovering this at desired value, in the future. 
 Here is snippet from Apartment class: 
 
 For me the best is to put enum as enum (possibly at MySql workbench) or as a string (and use   and   from Enum class).  
 But how to implement it with hibernate.  
 How to solve this trouble? 
 
 You can add following enumeration, to indicate you want the String representation to be persisted :  
 
 
 Use this annotation at field level: 
 
 
 I also had to add 
 @Embeddable to the java enum  
 @Embeddable
 public enum ApartmentState {
        FREE, REQUESTED, BOOKED, LIVED, CLEANING, PROCESSING
    }
