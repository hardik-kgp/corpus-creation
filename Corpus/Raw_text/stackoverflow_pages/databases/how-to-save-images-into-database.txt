*** how-to-save-images-into-database ***

 I'd like to know if there's a way to save Images (of the type .gif) to the sqllite-database. If yes how should my   look like. 
 Also is there a performance issue? 
 
 You should use   in your database: 
 Check  this tutorial ... 
 But I think you should download and store image in HashMap, which will make it simpler.  
 Code: 
 **Stroring**

 
 **Retrieving**

 
 **getLogoImage()**

 
 Hope it helps you. 
 
 There's nothing special in storing image to SQLite. Just create table with BLOB record type and do smth like: 
 
 Probably you migth want to save image chunk by chunk, since there's limits/recommended BLOB size (don't really recall how much) 
 
 Check this  tutorial , it should show you what you need.
