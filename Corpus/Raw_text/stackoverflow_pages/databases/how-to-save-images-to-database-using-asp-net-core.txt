*** how-to-save-images-to-database-using-asp-net-core ***

 I am working on a small blog using ASP.NET Core(MVC 6) EF Visual Studio. I have trouble finding how to save images to a database. I have read about IFormfile but I do not really understand how to go about it, I am stuck. I am new to this and would love to have a little help. 
 I want to save the image to the post I am creating(In the same form). I, therefore, want to save it to postID. Then I need to be able to display the image, how do I do that? I know there is a lot to ask, but I do not know where to turn. Feel free to send links if you have any good tips or ideas. 
 Thanks in advance!
