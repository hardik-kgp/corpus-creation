*** how-to-schedule-a-stored-procedure-in-mysql ***

 I have this stored procedure. How can I run this for example with intervals of 5 seconds? Like a routine for eliminate data with a time-stamp older than one day? 
 
 
 You can use mysql scheduler to run it each 5 seconds. You can find samples at  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-event.html 
 Never used it but I hope this would work: 
 
 
 I used this query and it worked for me: 
 
 
 In order to create a cronjob, follow these steps: 
 
 run this command : SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON; 
 If ERROR 1229 (HY000): Variable 'event_scheduler' is a GLOBAL
variable and should be set with SET GLOBAL:
 mportant 
 
 It is possible to set the Event Scheduler to DISABLED only at server startup. If event_scheduler is ON or OFF, you cannot set it to DISABLED at runtime. Also, if the Event Scheduler is set to DISABLED at startup, you cannot change the value of event_scheduler at runtime. 
 To disable the event scheduler, use one of the following two methods: 
 
 As a command-line option when starting the server: 
 
 In the server configuration file (my.cnf, or my.ini on Windows systems):
include the line where it will be read by the server (for example, in a [mysqld] section): 
 
 Read MySQL  documentation  for more information. 
 
 
 
 If you're open to out-of-the-DB solution: You could set up a cron job that runs a script that will itself call the procedure.
