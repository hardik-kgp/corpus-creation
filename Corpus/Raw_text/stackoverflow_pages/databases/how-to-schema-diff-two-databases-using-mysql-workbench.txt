*** how-to-schema-diff-two-databases-using-mysql-workbench ***

 Does anyone know how to pull a database Scheme Diff for two databases using MySQL Workbench.  v5.2 states it has this feature, but I can't seem to find it. I must use MySQL Workbench. 
 
 The database diff tool is part of the MySQL Utilities that you can access through MySQL Workbench in  . You can find the  relevant documentation here . 
 
 If you don't see this option directly you have to: 
 
 Click   and  
 On the new model window which has been opened, click   and  . 
 
 
 Just go to File->New Model, then Database -> Synchronize with any source. You have to be in model view to see this option in the Database menu. 
 
 you can open "Model view" 
 
 and choose "Compare schemas" option 
 
 
 I think the new link for the manual is  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.3/en/mysqldiff.html
