*** how-to-search-and-replace-all-instances-of-a-string-within-a-database ***

 I have a string that is contained inside of a wordpress install (the name of a server) thousands of times, across multiple columns, records and tables. 
 I'd like to update it with the location of another server - we are moving the content over. 
 So the source would be something like  http://my-server1/some/link/to/something , and I'd want to replace it with  http://my-other-server/some/link/to/something . I'm essentially looking to repeat this process for every instance of  http://my-server1 . 
 Is there an easy way to do this in MySQL? A tool?
Or do I sadly have to update every record problematically? 
 Thank you, 
 
 A crude (but effective) way of doing it would be to dump the schema into a file, carefully apply the search-and-replace and then re-import. 
 As a matter of fact I did that today :) 
 
 Came across this in a google search, but this may help some people. If you know the tables and columns (you could find this using the wildcard search in phpMyAdmin), 
 
 UPDATE  **table_name**
 SET  **column_name**
 = REPLACE( **column_name**
,
  ' **http://oldsite.com**
',' **http://newsite.com**
'); 
 
 Replace  **bold**
 parts with your own.  
 If you had a large database you could apply this into a script that could loop through each table and column. 
 
 The MySQL dump method would be the best bet if you're happy to re-import the whole database. For anyone that doesn't want to do this - WordPress core installation only actually consists of 11 tables, of which few are content columns, so doing a replace by column would be equally easy. Assuming you don't have loads of plugin tables referencing your link or string this would be your SQL: 
 
 
 Your question has been posted on 2009 and during that year another guy developed a basic php tool to search for a string throughout all the tables of a certain database. Optionally you can also replace all its occurrences with a different string. 
 Still after 5 years (at time of writing) the use of this tool against a Wordpress installation is effective and much easier in my opinion than using a mysql dump (although you might want to create a dump as well before running the script for backup purposes). 
 You can find more info in the blog of its author  Eric Amundson  and in the launchpad's page of the project  MySQL Search & Replace 
 I don't believe you are still looking for an answer after all this time, but I decided to post my hint as well, hoping it can help someone else popping over here in the future still searching for a solution to this issue. 
 
 There is also a Wordpress plugin called  Search Regex , which allows running   search and replace across the database. 
 
 Addittionally to Brad Larson's answer - to set variables like: 
 
 And then use it as follows: 
 
 
 MySQL's REPLACE or replacing the string manually in sql file or db in  **WordPress**
 is not a good way. WordPress uses serialized fields that may break if you replace some string in them (that was my case) 
 I used  Better Search Replace  plugin that worked for me perfectly
