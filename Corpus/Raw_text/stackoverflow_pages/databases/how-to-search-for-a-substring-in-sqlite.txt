*** how-to-search-for-a-substring-in-sqlite ***

 Whats the most efficient way to search for a sub string in SQLite? 
 I'm looking at the LIKE operator. 
 Do I have the right idea? Has this worked well for you?

 Thank You. 
 
 Yepper, use Like.    would return any row that had 'omm' anywhere in the name column. 
 
 You  can  use  , but it gets  really  slow if the pattern you're searching for starts with   -- i.e., if the substring you're looking for isn't necessarily at the beginning of the field. 
 If you need to do such searches, consider using  FTS3 , which makes full-text searching considerably more efficient. 
 
 Years have passed since the question was asked and answered and in 2012 SQLite version 3.7.15 introduced a function   - returns the location of a substring in a string, 0 if not found. ( https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/functions/instr.php )   
 
 sqlite> SELECT instr('TechOnTheNet.com', 'T'); 
  Result:  1 
 
 I have not benchmarked against  , but IMHO could be faster.
