*** how-to-see-a-sqlite-database-content-with-visual-studio-code ***

 I'm new to   and try to see a   file. 
I'm looking for a way to open and view a database content with   like Pycharm can do (see picture)  
 Does an extension could do that? Is it possible to achieve this in VSC? 
 
 I published an extension to query and explore sqlite3 databases 
 vscode-sqlite 
 
 Obviously, there is not yet a corresponding extension for vscode. Me, if necessary, I use "SQLite-Database-Browser". Very simple and sufficient for my purposes.  
 If you want to give it a try:  SQLite-Database-Browser 
 By the way, using Django with another database, such as   or  , is not too difficult.
