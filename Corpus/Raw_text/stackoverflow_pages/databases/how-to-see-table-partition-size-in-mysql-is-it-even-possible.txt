*** how-to-see-table-partition-size-in-mysql-is-it-even-possible ***

 I've partitioned my table horizontally and I'd like to see how the rows are currently distributed. Searching the web didn't bring any relevant results. 
 Could anyone tell me if this is possible? 
 
 You could get rows of each partitions using  . 
 Here are my sample tests. 
 
 **UPDATED**

 From  MySQL Manual : 
 
 For partitioned InnoDB tables, the row count given in the TABLE_ROWS column is only an estimated value used in SQL optimization, and may not always be exact. 
 
 Thanks to @Constantine. 
 
 Just to add to Jason's answers, as per reference manual, you have following ways to get information about existing partitions on your table - 
 
 Using Show Create Table -  to view the partitioning clauses used in creating a partitioned table;
 **Syntax**
 :  
 
 **Sample Output**
 :  
 
 Using Show Table Status - to determine whether a table is partitioned; 
 **Syntax:**

 
 **Sample Output:**
 Shows lots of information about table like Name, Engine, Version, Data Length etc. You get value 'partitioned' for 'Create_options' parameter in output. 
 Querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS table.  (Refer Jason's answers, you can optionally add SUBPARTITION_NAME, SUBPARTITION_ORDINAL_POSITION, SUBPARTITION_METHOD, PARTITION_EXPRESSION etc Select parameters to get more information. Refer  MySQL Ref Manual  ) 
 Using the statement EXPLAIN PARTITIONS SELECT - see which partitions are used by a given SELECT  
 **Syntax:**
  
 **Sample Output:**
