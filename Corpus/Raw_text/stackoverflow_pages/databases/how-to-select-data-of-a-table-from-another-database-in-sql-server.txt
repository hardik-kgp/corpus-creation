*** how-to-select-data-of-a-table-from-another-database-in-sql-server ***

 Suppose, I have a database named   in  **test server**
.
Also I have a database named  **proddb**
 in  **prod**
 server. 
 Now I want to select data of a table of  **testdb**
 database from  **proddb**
 database. 
 How can I do that in  ? 
 Also, I can do it using  **database link**
 in  **oracle**
. But how can do that in  **SQL Server**
?

 In SQL Server 2012 and above, you don't need to create a link. You can execute directly 
 
 I don't know whether previous versions of SQL Server work as well 
 
 I've used this before to setup a query against another server and db via linked server: 
 
 per the comment above:

 To do a cross server query, check out the system stored procedure:  **sp_addlinkedserver**

 Once the server is linked you can run a query against it. 
 
 Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio you can create  . First make connection to current (local) server, then go to   >   > context menu >  . In window   you have to specify desired server name for remote server, real server name or IP address (Data Source) and credentials (Security page). 
 And feather you can select data from linked server: 
 
 
 Try using OPENDATASOURCE
The syntax is like this:
