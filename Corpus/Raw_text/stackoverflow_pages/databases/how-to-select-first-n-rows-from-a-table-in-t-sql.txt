*** how-to-select-first-n-rows-from-a-table-in-t-sql ***

 Is there any way to select, for example, first 10 rows of a table in T-SQL (working MSSQL)? 
I think I saw something in Oracle defined as rownum meta variable, used in a following way
 
select * from Users where rownum<=10
 
But what about MSSQL?
     
 
 If   is a constant, you can drop the parentheses: 
 
 (the latter works on SQL Server 2000 too, while the former requires at least 2005) 
 
 
 Note that if you don't specify an   clause then any 10 rows could be returned, because "first 10 rows" doesn't really mean anything until you tell the database what ordering to use. 
 
 You can use Microsoft's row_number() function to decide which rows to return. That means that you aren't limited to just the top X results, you can take pages. 
 
 You have to nest the original query though, because otherwise you'll get an error message telling you that you can't do what you want to in the way you probably should be able to in an ideal world. 
 
 
 You can also use rowcount, but TOP is probably better and cleaner, hence the upvote for Mehrdad 
 
 
 Try this. 
 
 
 Try this: 
 
 
 
 SELECT TOP 10 * FROM  **TABLE_NAME**
 ORDER BY  **ORDERED_UNIQUE_COLUMN**

  DESC 
 
 **ORDERED_UNIQUE_COLUMN**
 could be your incrementing primary key or a timestamp
