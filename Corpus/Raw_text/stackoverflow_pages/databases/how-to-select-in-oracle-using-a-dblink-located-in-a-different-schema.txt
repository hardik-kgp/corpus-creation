*** how-to-select-in-oracle-using-a-dblink-located-in-a-different-schema ***

 We have an Oracle DBMS (11g) and the following configuration: 
 
 A DB user "MYUSER" 
 Two schemas "MYUSER" and "SCHEMA_B" 
 User "MYUSER" can access "SCHEMA_B" and has READ permissions on its tables 
 A public DB link "DB_LINK" located in "SCHEMA_B" 
 The DB_LINK is working when using the DB user "SCHEMA_B" directly 
 
 **Question**
: When logged on as "MYUSER", what is the correct syntax to access tables using the DB link of "SCHEMA_B"? Is it possible to do so at all? 
 I already tried several constellations, which all did not work: 
 
 The error message I receive is:
ORA-02019. 00000 -  "connection description for remote database not found" 
 Thanks for any suggestion! 
 
 I don't think it is possible to share a database link between more than one user but not all.  They are either private (for one user only) or public (for all users). 
 A good way around this is to create a view in SCHEMA_B that exposes the table you want to access through the database link.  This will also give you good control over who is allowed to select from the database link, as you can control the access to the view. 
 Do like this:
