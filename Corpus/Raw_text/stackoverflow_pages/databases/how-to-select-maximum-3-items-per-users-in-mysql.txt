*** how-to-select-maximum-3-items-per-users-in-mysql ***

 I run a website where users can post items (e.g. pictures). The items are stored in a MySQL database.  
 I want to query for the last ten posted items BUT with the constraint of a maximum of 3 items can come from any single user.  
 What is the best way of doing it? My preferred solution is a constraint that is put on the SQL query requesting the last ten items. But ideas on how to set up the database design is very welcome. 
 Thanks in advance!

 It's pretty easy with a correlated sub-query: 
 
 The query assumes that larger   means added later 
 Correlated sub-queries are a powerful tool! :-) 
 
 This is difficult because MySQL does not support the LIMIT clause on sub-queries. If it did, this would be rather trivial... But alas, here is my na√Øve approach: 
 
 You did not comment on having a preferred result order, so this selects the latest images (assuming   is an ascending auto-incrementing value). 
 For comparison, on SQL Server the same would look like this: 
 
 
 I would first select 10 distinct users, then selecting images from each of those users with a LIMIT 3, possibly by a union of all those and limit that to 10. 
 That would atleast narrow down the data you need to process to a fair amount.
