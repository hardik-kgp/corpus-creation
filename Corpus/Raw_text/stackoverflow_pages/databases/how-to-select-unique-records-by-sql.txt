*** how-to-select-unique-records-by-sql ***

 When I perform "SELECT * FROM table" I got results like below: 
 
 As you can see, there are dup records from column2 (item1 are dupped). So how could I just get result like this: 
 
 Only one record are returned from the duplicate, along with the rest of the unique records. 
 
 You can use   or   to do this. 
 
 or 
 
  will be more helpful if you want to use some aggregate function like   or  
 
 
 If you only need to remove duplicates then use  .   should be used to apply aggregate operators to each group 
 GROUP BY v DISTINCT 
 
 It depends on which rown you want to return for each unique item.  Your data seems to indicate the minimum data value so in this instance for SQL Server. 
 
 
 just use inner join because group by won't work with multiple columns saying not contained in either an aggregate function. 
 
 
 There are 4 methods you can use: 
 
 DISTINCT 
 GROUP BY 
 Subquery 
 Common Table Expression (CTE) with ROW_NUMBER() 
 
 Consider the following sample   with test data: 
 
 **Option 1: SELECT DISTINCT**

 This is the most simple and straight forward, but also the most limited way: 
 
 **Option 2: GROUP BY**

 Grouping allows you to add aggregated data, like the  ,  ,  , etc: 
 
 **Option 3: Subquery**

 Using a subquery, you can first identify the duplicate rows to ignore, and then filter them out in the outer query with the   construct: 
 
 **Option 4: Common Table Expression with ROW_NUMBER()**

 In the Common Table Expression (CTE), select the ROW_NUMBER(), partitioned by the group column and ordered in the desired order.  Then SELECT only the records that have  : 
 
 
 I find that if I can't use DISTINCT for any reason, then GROUP BY will work. 
 
 To get all the columns in your result you need to place something as: 
 
 it will place  **a**
 as the first column and the rest will be ALL of the columns in the same order as your definition. This is, column  **a**
 will be repeated. 
 
 Select Eff_st 
from
(
select EFF_ST,ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY eff_st) XYZ
                         -
from ABC.CODE_DIM 
 )
where XYZ= 1
order by EFF_ST fetch first 5 row only
