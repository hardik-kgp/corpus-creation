 How do I set a column to increment automatically with Oracle SQL Developer? Why is the form disabled? 
 
 **Note:**
 The image shows the Data Modeler, but the question and top answer talk about editing an existing database. 
 
 If you want to make your PK auto increment, you need to set the ID column property for that primary key. 
 
 Right click on the table and select "Edit". 
 In "Edit" Table window, select "columns", and then select your PK
column. 
 Go to ID Column tab and select Column Sequence as Type. This will
create a trigger and a sequence, and associate the sequence to
primary key. 
 
 See the picture below for better understanding.

 Unfortunately oracle doesnot support auto_increment like mysql does. You need to put a little extra effort to get that. 
 say this is your table - 
 
 You will need to create a sequence - 
 
 and a trigger - 
 
 
 You can make auto increment in SQL Modeler. In column properties window Click : General then Tick the box of Auto Increment. After that the auto increment window will be enabled for you. 
 
 @tom-studee you were right, it's possible to do it in the data modeler. 
 Double click your table, then go to the column section. Here double click on the column which will have the auto increment. In the general section there is a checkbox "autoincrement", just tick it. 
 After that you can also go to the "autoincrement" section to customize it. 
 When you save it and ask the data modeler to generate the SQL script, you will see the sequence and trigger which represent your autoincrement. 
 
 **UPDATE**
: In Oracle 12c onward we have an option to create auto increment field, its better than trigger and sequence. 
 
 Right click on the table and select "Edit". 
 In "Edit" Table window, select "columns", and then select your PK
column. 
 Go to Identity Column tab and select "Generated as Identity" as Type, put 1 in both start with and increment field. This will
make this column auto increment.  
 
 **See the below image**

 
 **From SQL Statement**

 IDENTITY column is now available on Oracle 12c: 
 
 or specify starting and increment values, also preventing any insert into the identity column (GENERATED ALWAYS) (again, Oracle 12c+ only) 
 
 **EDIT**
 : if you face any error like "ORA-30673: column to be modified is not an identity column", then you need to create new column and delete the old one. 
 
 Oracle doesn't have autoincrementing columns. You need a sequence and a trigger. Here's a random blog post that explains how to do it:  http://www.lifeaftercoffee.com/2006/02/17/how-to-create-auto-increment-columns-in-oracle/ 
 
 How to do it with Oracle SQL Developer:
In the Left pane, under the connections you will find "Sequences", right click and select create a new sequence from the context sensitive pop up. Fill out the details: Schema name, sequence_name, properties(start with value, min value, max value, increment value etc.) and click ok. Assuming that you have a table with a key that uses this auto_increment, while inserting in this table just give "your_sequence_name.nextval" in the field that utilizes this property.
I guess this should help! :)   
 
 I found this post, which looks a bit old, but I figured I'd update everyone on my new findings. 
 I am using Oracle SQL Developer 4.0.2.15 on Windows.
Our database is Oracle 10g (version 10.2.0.1) running on Windows. 
 To make a column auto-increment in Oracle -  
 
 Open up the database connection in the Connections tab 
 Expand the Tables section, and right click the table that has the column you want to change to auto-increment, and select Edit... 
 Choose the Columns section, and select the column you want to auto-increment (Primary Key column) 
 Next, click the "Identity Column" section below the list of columns, and change type from None to "Column Sequence" 
 Leave the default settings (or change the names of the sequence and trigger if you'd prefer) and then click OK 
 
 Your id column (primary key) will now auto-increment, but the sequence will be starting at 1.
If you need to increment the id to a certain point, you'll have to run a few alter statements against the sequence. 
 This post  has some more details and how to overcome this.
