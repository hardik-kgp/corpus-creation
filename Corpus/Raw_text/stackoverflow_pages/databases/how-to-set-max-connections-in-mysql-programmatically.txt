*** how-to-set-max-connections-in-mysql-programmatically ***

 I have a server where a lot of users will connect to it and use a database there, and I am using MySQL. I know that the default number of   in MySQL is 100 or 150 but I am sure I need way beyond that number, therefore I used the following to increase the number: 
 
 Now I try to check the   as follows: 
 
 It gives me the following: 
 
 Which is a sign that it succeeded (unless I am understanding it wrong). When my users start to connect I am receiving an error from the server when the number of connected users exceeds 110. The error is: 
 
 error connecting: Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior
  to obtaining a connection from the pool.  This may have occurred

  reached. 
 
 Why am I getting this error, and how to fix it?

 I had never seen your error message before, so I googled. probably, you are using Connector/Net.  **Connector/Net Manual**
 says there is max connection pool size. (default is 100) see table 22.21. 
 I suggest that you increase this value to 100k or disable connection pooling  
 **UPDATED**

 he has two questions. 
 **Q1 - what happens if I disable pooling**

Slow down making DB connection.   is a mechanism that use already made DB connection. cost of Making new connection is high.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool 
 **Q2 - Can the value of pooling be increased or the maximum is 100?**

 you can increase but I'm sure what is MAX value, maybe   in my.cnf 
 My suggestion is that do not turn off Pooling, increase value by 100 until there is no connection error. 
 If you have Stress Test tool like   you can test youself. 
 
 You can set max connections using: 
 
 This will set your number of mysql connection unti (Requires   privileges).
