*** how-to-set-mongodb-charset-to-utf8 ***

 I'm new to mongodb. I need to store some data in utf8 encoding in my DB. When I export them or see them into console, they don't display correctly. Can I set my database to utf8 character set to solve this problems? If yes, how can I do this? 
 
  can only be encoded in  . If your problem is with export and console, you probably are not converting your data to   before uploading it to  .
