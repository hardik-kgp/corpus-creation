*** how-to-show-clob-type-in-a-select-in-sql-server ***

 I have a table with one column of CLOB type data, they are all very short no more than 20 bytes, however I cannot see the actual string in the CLOB data. 
 For example if I use  , under the CLOB type every data is like: 
 
 But I just want to see the content of the CLOB data. 
 I tried: 
 
 And it doesn't work, error is: 
 
 Error Code: 4121, SQL State: S1000 
  Cannot find either column "DBMS_LOB" or the user-defined function or aggregate "DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR", or the name is ambiguous. 
 
 So can I ask what's the syntax for direct display a CLOB data in a query? 
 I'm using SQL Server with  . 
 
 I figured out one solution. There should be better ways, please show more possible solutions in the comments. 
 
 
 I have table with one column has CLOB data type(1000K), after storing message/data into CLOB column and found one solution see the actual data in CLOB column. 
 
 The above query CAST the CLOB(Character Large Objects) into a normal String. 
 
 To see it in DbVis you just have to change it in the options.
There is an entry for the display of CLOB columns. 
 
 I presume you are using jDTS driver to connect to the SQL Server.
In the driver properties of the connection you can set the "USELOBS" to False to automatically cast them to string. 
 
 I had the same problem and solved it by using DBeaver ( http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/ ) instead of dbVisualizer. 
 When I use DBeaver and do a select * from my SQLServer I can just double-click the CLOB in the result set and it opens in a new window with the content. Very slick.
