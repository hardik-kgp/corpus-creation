*** how-to-store-a-one-to-many-relation-in-my-sql-database-mysql ***

 I'm making a website and I need to store a random number of data in my database. 
 for example: User john may have one phone number where jack can have 3.  
 I need to be able so store an infinite number of values per user. 
 I couldn't find how to do this anywhere, Hope you can help me! :) 
 I am a novice in Relational databases. 
 
 You create a separate table for phone numbers (i.e. a 1:M relationship). 
 
 Now you can, in an easily manner, get a users phone numbers with a simple join; 
 
 
 I think you need to create a one to many relationship table.
