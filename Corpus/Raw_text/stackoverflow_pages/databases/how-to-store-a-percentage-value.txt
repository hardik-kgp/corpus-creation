*** how-to-store-a-percentage-value ***

 I am using Rails 3.2.2 and I would like to  store  and  handle  a percentage value in a my database table column. What do you advice about (for example, what type -  ,  ,  , ... - of the column should I set)? Is there some alert that I must/should know about storing percentage values? 
 The precision should be  2  ( ,  , ...). 
 Note : I read  this post . 
 
 It depends a little on how you plan to use the value, but typically a   would be a good choice for storing percentages.  And note that you could store it as the percentage value (10.01) or as the fractional (.1001).  So that would affect the actual size and precision of the column. 
 The choice between storing as a percent or fraction depends on the usage needs, but I  suspect  that in most situations it would be simpler to store it as a fraction (e.g., .10 to represent 10%) because it can be used directly in most calculations more easily (don't need to remember to divide by 100).  
 And as @ismaelga points out in the comments, a decimal is a good choice for accuracy (particularly nice when dealing with monetary calculations).
