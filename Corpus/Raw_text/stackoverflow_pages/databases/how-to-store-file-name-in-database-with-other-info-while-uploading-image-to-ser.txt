I am stuck with this as a have done much PHP before. I have come to the end of trying different websites tutorials with no much success could anyone please help me! I need it done for a project I'm doing.  
 I am basically trying to make a CMS that allows users to upload a photo of a band member and have information stored about them so that it can be displayed on a webpage for the public to view.

 And the Examples form I have to use is this:

 **Here is the **
**answer**
** for those of you looking like I did all over the web trying to find out how to do this task. Uploading a photo to a server with the file name stored in a mysql database and other form data you want in your Database.**
 Please let me know if it helped.  
 Firstly the form you need:

 You have an ID for each photo so my suggestion is you rename the photo. For example you rename it by the date 
 
 note: don't forget the file extension of your file or you can generate random string for the photo, but I would not recommend that. I would also recommend you to check the file extension before you upload it to your directory. 
 
 Hope this might help. 
 
 
 **save it as addMember.php**

 
 in the above code one little bug ,i fixed that bug. 
 
 If you want to input more data into the form, you simply access the submitted data through $_POST.  
 If you have  
 
 you access it with  
 
 You could then update your query line to read 
 
 **Note:**
 Always filter and sanitize your data. 
 
 Your part: 
 
 Doesn't make much sense, your connection shouldn't be named $result but that is a naming issue not a coding one. 
 What is a coding issue is if($result), your saying if you can connect to the database regardless of the insert query failing or succeeding you will output "Image saved into database". 
 Try adding do  
 
 and change the if($result) to $realresult 
 I suspect your query is failing, perhaps you have additional columns or something? 
 Try copy/pasting your query, replacing the ".$_FILES['filep']['name']." with test and running it in your query browser and see if it goes in. 
 
 Adding the following avoids problems with quotes in file names, e.g. 
 
 which are acceptable on some operating systems.
