*** how-to-store-json-object-in-sqlite-database ***

 how do I store a JSON Object in an SQLite database?  What is the correct way? 
 one place is the blob type column.  if i can convert the JSON object into byte array and use Fileoutputstream 
 the other idea is to store in a text column as a String 
 
 
 Convert JSONObject into String and save as TEXT/ VARCHAR. While retrieving the same column convert the String into JSONObject.   
 For example  
 **Write into DB**
  
 
 **Read from DB**
  
 
 
 An alternative could be to use the new JSON extension for SQLite. I've only just come across this myself:  https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html  This would allow you to perform a certain level of querying the stored JSON. If you used VARCHAR or TEXT to store a JSON string you would have no ability to query it. This is a great article showing its usage (in python)  http://charlesleifer.com/blog/using-the-sqlite-json1-and-fts5-extensions-with-python/   
 
 There is no data types for that.. You need to store it as VARCHAR or TEXT only..  
 
 https://github.com/requery/sqlite-android  allows you to query JSON fields (and arrays in them, I've tried it and am using it). Before that I was just storing JSON strings into a TEXT column. It supports FTS3, FTS4, & JSON1 
 As of July 2019, it still gets version bumps every now and then, so it isn't a dead project.

 At first generate Plain Old Java Objects from JSON  http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/ 
 Main method 
 void createDb(String dbName, String tableName, List dataList, Field[] fields){
... 
 Fields name will create dynamically
