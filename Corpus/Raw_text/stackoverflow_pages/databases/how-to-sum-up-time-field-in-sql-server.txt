*** how-to-sum-up-time-field-in-sql-server ***

 I have a column called "WrkHrs" and the data type is time(hh:mm:ss). I want to sum up the working hours for employees. But since it's time data type sql server doesn't let me use like  . 
 How can I sum up the time data type fieled in sql query? 
 
 
 You can format it pretty on the front end. Or in T-SQL: 
 
 However, you're using the wrong data type.   is used to indicate a point in time, not an interval or duration. Wouldn't it make sense to store their work hours in two distinct columns,   and  ? 
 
 In order to sum up the working hours for an employee you can calculate the difference between the shift start time and end time in minutes and convert it to readable format as following: 
 
 The result :  **02:47**

two hours and 47 minutes 
 
 
 
 For MS SQL Server, when your WorkingTime is stored as a time, or a varchar in order to sum it up you should consider that: 
 1) Time format is not supporting sum, so you need to parse it 
 2) 23:59:59.9999999 is the maximum value for the time.  
 So, the code that will work to get you the total number of WorkingHours:WorkingMinutes:WorkingSeconds would be the following:
