*** how-to-tag-a-changeset-in-liquibase-to-rollback ***

 I have configured the maven pluggin for liquibase as specified in  maven configuration . 
Now created a changeset like :- 
 
 Created the  sql to update DB using command line :-
 **mvn liquibase:updateSQL**

 But just want to know how to rollback using a "rollbackTag" parameter.
i.e. If run the command " **mvn liquibase:rollbackSQL**
", what should be the value of "rollbackTag" parameter. 
 And is it possible to rollback using the changeset id ? 
 
 Rollback tags are designed to checkpoint your database's configuration. 
 The following commands will roll the database configuration back by 3 changesets and create a tag called "checkpoint": 
 
 You can now update the database, and at any stage rollback to that point using the rollback tag: 
 
 or alternatively generate the rollback SQL:  
 
 Revised example 
 I initially found it difficult to figure out how to configure the liquibase Maven plugin. Just in case it helps here's the example I've used.  
 The liquibase update is configured to run automatically, followed by tagging the database at the current Maven revision number. 
 
 Liquibase is now configured as part of the standard life-cycle so can be run as follows: 
 
 
 I personally prefer to put the tag as part of the changeset files, so if you have to rollback or delete all the records in the   you won't loose your tagging records.
