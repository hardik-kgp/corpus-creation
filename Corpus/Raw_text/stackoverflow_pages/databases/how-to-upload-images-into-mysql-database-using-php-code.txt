*** how-to-upload-images-into-mysql-database-using-php-code ***

 I am trying to save images in my database from HTML form. I have written PHP code to accomplish this task. The program is not generating any error message, but also not inserting image data in MySQL database. Kindly check it.
Here i am sharing a excerpt from my code. 
 
 
 Error Message
  You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that
  corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use
  near '' at line 1 
 
 
 Firstly, you should check if your  **image column is BLOB type**
! 
 I don't know anything about your SQL table, but if I'll try to make my own as an example. 
 We got fields   (int),   (blob) and   (varchar(64)). 
 So the code should look like this (assume ID is always '1' and let's use this mysql_query): 
 
 You are doing it wrong in many ways. Don't use mysql functions - they are deprecated! Use  PDO  or  MySQLi . You should also think about storing files locations on disk. Using MySQL for storing images is thought to be Bad Idea™. Handling SQL table with big data like images can be problematic. 
 Also your HTML form is out of standards. It should look like this: 
 
 
 Sidenote: 
 When dealing with files and storing them as a BLOB, the data must be escaped using  , otherwise it will result in a syntax error. 
 
 **Just few more details**
： 
 
 Add mysql field 
 
 
 
 Get data from image 
 
 
 
 Insert image data into db 
 
 
 
 Show image to the web 
 
 
 
 End 
 
 
 This is the perfect code for uploading and displaying image through MySQL database.
