*** how-to-use-an-user-variables-in-mysql-like-clause ***

 I am trying to setup a few simple SQL scripts to help with some short term DB administration.
As such, I'm setting up variables to try to make it easier to reuse these scripts. 
 The problem I'm having is specifically with the LIKE clause. 
 
 So I want to have it finding results based on the email SET in the variable.  The query works if I manually enter the email into the LIKE clause. 
 How can I get the LIKE clause to work with the user variable? 
 UPDATE:
@dems's answer works for this simple case, but I'm having trouble with a more complex query. 
 
 Gives me the error "FUNCTION mydb.CONCAT does not exist" 
 The query works without the CONCAT(): 
 
 
 
 
 Works without concat(): 
 
 (Mysql version 5.+) 
 
 No need to CONCAT just use '%'+ Variable +'%': 
 
 
 Using same syntax as oracle seems to work: 
 
 
 You may have error 
 
 In this case you need to specify the same collation as used for your table like that: 
 
 
 I resolved using the CONCAT function before using LIKE statement: 
 
 It works fine for me
