*** how-to-use-blob-datatype-in-postgres ***

 I am using a Postgresql database in my rails application.
To store large file or data in database I have used blob data type in MySql.  
 For Postgres which data type I have to use instead of blob in MySql? 
 Thanks! 
 
 use  bytea  (or  Large Objects  if you  absolutely have to) 
 
 I think this is the most comprehensive answer on the PostgreSQL wiki itself:  https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/BinaryFilesInDB 
 Read the part with the title 'What is the best way to store the files in the Database?' 
 
 Storing files in your database will lead to a huge database size. You may not like that, for development, testing, backups, etc.  
 Instead, you'd use FileStream (SQL-Server) or BFILE (Oracle).  
 There is no default-implementation of BFILE/FileStream in Postgres, but you can add it:

 And further information (in french) can be obtained here:

 To answer the acual question: 
Apart from  , for really large files, you can use  LOBS :
