 How do you use enums in Oracle using SQL only? (No PSQL) 
 In MySQL you can do: 
 
 What would be a similar way to do this in Oracle? 
 
 Reading a bit about the  MySQL enum , I'm guessing the closest equivalent would be a simple check constraint 
 
 but that doesn't allow you to reference the value by the index.  A more complicated foreign key relationship would also be possible 
 
 As long as you operate through the view, it would seem that your could replicate the functionality reasonably well. 
 Now, if you admit PL/SQL solutions, you can create custom object types that could include logic to limit the set of values they can hold and to have methods to get the IDs and to get the values, etc. 
 
 At this link you can find an alternative solution/workaround for Oracle, inspired by C language enums:  http://www.petefinnigan.com/weblog/archives/00001246.htm 
 Shortly put, Pete suggests to define some integer constants and to use a SUBTYPE to constrait them: 
 
 After that you can declare variables, pass parameters and return values from functions and so on, with type COLORS. 
 
 Why not use a constraint for the column? It will do the same thing: 
 ALTER TABLE x ADD CONSTRAINT size_constraint check (x_size in ('small', 'medium', 'large'))
