*** how-to-use-findorcreate-in-sequelize ***

 I am Sequelize beginner.
I'd like to oAuth authenticate with Twitter or Facebook and want to save user information in the database.
But if oAuth authentication is done on multiple sites, there is a problem that information such as userid registered in the database will duplicate with other site .
In order to avoid this, I would like to do a process to update the database only when the specified userid does not already exist in the database.
I knew that we could use sequelize's findOrCreate to do such processing, but I do not know how to use findOrCreate.
I know how to use upsert and I'd like to do findOrCreate like the description of upsert below. However, we want to perform conditional branching like if (userid! = "○○○" && username! = "○○○"). 
 
 What shoudl I do? 
 
 
 
 Another option is to use Sequelize hooks. You'd want to make your hook callback async (Sequelize supports it), so in the hook you can run your check and return a promise only if your check is successful (and throw an error otherwise).
