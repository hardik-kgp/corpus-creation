*** how-to-use-flyway-configuration-to-handle-multiple-databases ***

 we have a java application configured with maven that uses multiple databases. It is one app - many schemas. 
 I've configured flyway, tested and it works well but my config is only for one database. 
 Here is my pom.xml tested with one schema: 
 
 Update: by using the answer provided now I have the following pom.xml configured with 2 schemas. 
 
 I execute flyway operations but none worked, here is the error I got: 
 
 The database configuration is ok. Also I checked the schemas are ok What I am missing? 
 UPDATE: I removed from the command line flyway: and it worked well. Thanks  
 
 You can specify multiple executions for a single plugin with different configurations: 
 
 You can use 'location' property to define migrations you want to run for each schema, just like it's done in example above. The location type is determined by its prefix. Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain both sql and java-based migrations. Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem and may only contain sql migrations.
