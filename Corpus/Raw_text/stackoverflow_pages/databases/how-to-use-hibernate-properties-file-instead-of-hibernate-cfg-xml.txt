*** how-to-use-hibernate-properties-file-instead-of-hibernate-cfg-xml ***

 I am trying to connect to DB in a servlet using Hibernate.I have read that we can use either hibernate.cfg.xml or hibernate.properties file for configuration of session.For me it worked with xml. Now when I am trying to use properties instead of xml its not working.
It is saying that  **hibernate.cfg.xml**
  **not found**
.But nowhere I mentioned to use xml file and infact I have deleted that xml file. 
 Please Help me.
And Please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. 
 
 From what i understood from hibernate the best thing to do is to define the mapping in the   file and other configurations in the  . 
 An alternative approach to configuration is to specify a full configuration in a file named  . This file can be used as a replacement for the   file or, if both are present, to override properties. 
 The   is also more convenient once you have to tune the Hibernate cache. It is your choice to use either hibernate.properties or  . Both are equivalent. 
 You can read more about this in the following link: 
 http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html 
 
 This code will call hibernate.cfg.xml by default: 
 
 And this code will call hibernate.properties by default: 
 
 Hope it helps. 
 
 Remove   if you are using  . Below code is
  session factory implementation. 
 
 hibernate.properites file 
 
 
 If you are using a  **database**
 from a  **servlet**
 then you should define a  **DataSource**
 in your server and point one hibernate property at that instead of defining everything via all the other hibernate properties you're probably using now. 
 This has the benefit of permitting you to define connection pooling and other connection related parameters independently of your application.  
 For example, your production environment is likely to have a different database password than your test and development environments.
