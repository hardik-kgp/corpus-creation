*** how-to-use-mongoimport-to-import-csv ***

 Trying to import a CSV with contact information: 
 
 Running this doesn't seem to add any documents to the database: 
 
 Trace says  , but firing up the Mongo shell and running   doesn't show any new documents.  
 What am I missing? 
 
 Your example worked for me with MongoDB 1.6.3 and 1.7.3. Example below was for 1.7.3. Are you using an older version of MongoDB? 
 
 
 I was perplexed with a similar problem where mongoimport did not give me an error but would report importing 0 records.  I had saved my file that didn't work using the OSX Excel for Mac 2011 version using the default "Save as.." "xls as csv" without specifying "Windows Comma Separated(.csv)" format specifically.  After researching this site and trying the "Save As again using "Windows Comma Separated (.csv)" format, mongoimport worked fine.  I think mongoimport expects a newline character on each line and the default Mac Excel 2011 csv export didn't provide that character at the end of each line. 
 
 We need to execute the following command: 
 
 
 -d is database name 
 -c is collection name 
 --headerline If using --type csv or --type tsv, uses the first line as field names. Otherwise, mongoimport will import the first line as a distinct document. 
 
 For more information:  mongoimport 
 
 you will most likely need to authenticate if you're working in production sort of environments. You can use something like this to authenticate against the correct database with appropriate credentials. 
 
 
 Check that you have a blank line at the end of the file, otherwise the last line will be ignored on some versions of mongoimport 
 
 I use this on mongoimport shell 
 
 type can choose csv/tsv/json
But only csv/tsv can use  
 You can read more on the  offical doc . 
 
 Robert Stewart have already answered for how to import with mongoimport. 
 I am suggesting easy way to import CSV elegantly with  3T MongoChef  Tool (3.2+ version). Might help someone in future. 
 
 You just need to select collection 
 Select file to import 
 You can also unselect data which is going to import. Also many options are there. 
 Collection imported

 First you should come out of the   shell and then execute the   command like this: 
 
 
 Robert Stewart's answers is great. 
 I'd like to add that you also can type your fields with --columHaveTypes and --fields like this :  
 
 (Careful to not have any space after the comma between your fields) 
 For other types, see doc here :  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/#cmdoption-mongoimport-columnshavetypes 
 
 For the 3.4 version, please use the following syntax: 
 
 After 3 days, I finally made it on my own. Thanks to all the users who supported me. 
 
 C:\wamp\mongodb\bin>mongoexport --db  proj_mmm --collection offerings --csv --fieldFile offerings_fields.txt --out offerings.csv 
 
 Just use this after executing mongoimport  
 It will return number of objects imported  
 
 will return the number of objects. 
 
 use : 
 
 
 **mongoimport -d test -c test --type csv --file SampleCSVFile_119kb.csv --headerline**

 check collection data:- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Strangely no one mentioned   flag: 
 
 
 
 Sharing for future readers: 
 
 In our case, we needed to add the   parameter to make it work 
 
 
 My requirement was to import the   to remote   instance. For  below command worked for me: 
 
 For example: 
 
 Below is the screenshot of how it looks like after import: 
 
 where   and   are the columns in the   file. 
 
 Given   file I have which has only one column with  **no Header**
, below command worked for me: 
 
 where  **field-name refers to the Header name**
 of the column in   file. 
 
 When I was trying to import the CSV file, I was getting an error. What I have done.
First I changed the header line's column names in Capital letter and removed "-" and added "_" if needed. Then Typed below command for importing CSV into mongo 
 
 
 
 Make sure to copy the .csv file to /usr/local/bin or whatever folder your mondodb is in
