*** how-to-use-not-exists-with-composite-keys-in-sql-for-inserting-data-from-pojo ***

 I am using DB2 DBMS. 
 **Scenario 1:**

 myTable has a composite key (key1, key2) where both key1 and key2 are foreign keys from yourTable. 
 I want to insert new data from yourTable into myTable, but only if the key1, key2 combination does not already exist in myTable. 
 
 **Scenario 2:**

 I put data into a java object from yourTable with properties data1, data2, and data. 
 I want to insert the above data with the check as in Scenario1. data1 + data2 should not already be present in myTable. 
 How do I achieve this? I don't think we can use a SELECT statement inside the insert statement. 
 
 How can I achieve this? 
 
 
 or 
 
 for your 2nd scenario, it'd look similar to the above query 
 
 
 
 if the data 'c' '3' already exists then above query will result in an empty table.
