*** how-to-use-typeahead-js-with-a-large-database ***

 I have a large database of 10,000 addresses and 5,000 people. 
 I want to let users search the database for either an address or a user. I'd like to use Twitter's typeahead to suggest results as they enter text. 
 See the NBA example here:  http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples . 
 I understand that prefetching 15,000 items would not be optimal from a speed and load standpoint. What would be a better way to try and achieve this? 
 
 Since no one made any answer, I will go ahead with my suggestion then. 
 I think the best fit for your big database is using   with  . Quick example: 
 
 What it does is when you type characters in the   it will send AJAX request to the page   with query as the content of the input. 
 On   you can catch this query and look it up in your DB: 
 
 Of course since your DB is quite big, you should optimize your SQL query to query faster, maybe cache the result, etc. 
 On the typeahead side, to reduce load to query DB, you can specify   or  : 
 
 So it doesn't really matter how big your DB is, this approach should work nicely. 
 This is an example in PHP but of course it should be the same for whatever backend you have. Hope you get the basic idea.
