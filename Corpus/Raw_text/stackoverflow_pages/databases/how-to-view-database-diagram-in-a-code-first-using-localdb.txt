 I have a   project with   using   created in  .
Although I can see my class relations in a  , how to see a visual diagram of automatic generated database by   ? 
 
 Install  Entity Framework Power Tools Beta 4 , restart Visual Studio, right-click on the context in your solution view and you'll see a new 'Entity Framework' option in the context menu. Select 'View Entity Data Model' to see a beautiful visual database diagram in Visual Studio. Voil√†! 
 Entity Framework 6 Power Tools:  Link 
 
 You can use  **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2012**
 with   which supports Database Diagrams in they way you may be used to with other SQL Server database. 
 
 Open Management Studio (should have been installed with Visual Studio) 
 Connect to  , with Windows Authentication 
 Find the relevant database 
 Expand Database Digrams, and install diagram support objects if you've not already 
 Add the tables you need and you're done!

 I checked out the  Entity Framework Power Tools Beta 4  and it is no longer being supported. Intead, you can use the new  Entity Framework 6 Power Tools Community Edition . 
 It is supposed to work the same.
