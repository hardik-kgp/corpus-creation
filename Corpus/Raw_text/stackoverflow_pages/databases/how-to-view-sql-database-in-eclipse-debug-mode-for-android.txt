*** how-to-view-sql-database-in-eclipse-debug-mode-for-android ***

 I am looking for a way to see realtime (as I debug) what is in my SQL database. 
 Does anyone know how to do this?  I have tried looking through the variables tab but can't seem to find anything. 
 
 Open view Window->Show View->File Explorer. 
In this view go to data/data/"your app name"/databases/"your database" This is you database file. I use Questoid SQLite browser (It was available in www.questoid.com/Forums/tabid/59/aff/9/aft/7/afv/topic/Default.aspx) plugin for eclipse. 
 
 I don't know of any way to view it through Eclipse but you can perform queries on the database through the ADB.  Check out  Examining sqlite3 Databases from a Remote Shell .
