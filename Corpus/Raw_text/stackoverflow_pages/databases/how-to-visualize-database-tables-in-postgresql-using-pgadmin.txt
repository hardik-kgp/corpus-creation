*** how-to-visualize-database-tables-in-postgresql-using-pgadmin ***

 I am trying to visualize tables and their relations using pgAdmin. I have understood that there is a  query visualizer tool  available for pgAdmin. However, that only is useful if you are dealing with queries. My main goal is to generate a graphical representation of all the tables available in database. 
 
 For pgadmin 3
Go to Tools -> Query Tool 
 Graphical Query Builder is a tab in the Query Tool view. 
 unfortunately Pgadmin 4 does not have this option. 
 
 I have found  this webpage  on postgresql wiki, with various tools on utilizing a postgresql database. I have used DbWrench on Mac to generate the ERD. 
 
 try pgModeler - there is working demo (although limited by number of objects). Also only PostgreSQL 9.x is supported.
