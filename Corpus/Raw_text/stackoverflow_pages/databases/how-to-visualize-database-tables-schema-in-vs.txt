 How do I display that schema of tables in my database and foreign keys that links them in VS ?  
 Example of such schema is used in  this  question mattlant's answer. 
 
 They can be done through Visual Studio or the Sql Server Management Studio. 
 In visual studio just open the "Server Explorer" window, right-click on the Database Diagrams folder (under the db you want), and choose "Add Database Diagram", just drag-and-drop the tables you want onto the diagram. 
 Through Sql Server management studio there done the same way (just without the server explorer window).
