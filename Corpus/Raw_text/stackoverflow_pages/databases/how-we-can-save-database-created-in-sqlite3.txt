*** how-we-can-save-database-created-in-sqlite3 ***

 I am new to database. I am trying to create a database and table in it.
but unable to save and open again after exiting from sqlite.
I am using  sqlite3 3.6.20 on centOS, when i will enter following command 
 
 it will print following error message. 
 
 and when Print .help
it wont show any command related to save and open existing database.
thanks in advance.

 You don't need to save. Each transaction writes to disk. (More or less.)  
 To create the database "test.sl3", you can do this. (From the command line. Programs work about the same way.) 
 
 No  . Now load the database again. 
 
 The data is still there. 
 
 as Mike pointed out in his answer, you should provide a file name to put the database in.  
 If you did a lot of work and you did not provide a file name up front and you work in a version in which the   command is not yet available (you quote that   does not know it and I also do not see it in  ) you can use the   command 
 
 
 You're supposed to provide a filename as an argument for the .save command, e.g.:
