 Let's say I have a database with 1,000,000 keys. Is there a way to know the last 10 keys from that database? 
 
 You will need to maintain it as another list using the following commands. 
 
 
 As a workaround if I don't want to change anything in the cache, I tail the AOF file to see what's the latest change there. 
 
 tail -f /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof 
 
 From there, you can see the key, value and command used. 
 
 Some commands has    wich you can fill and get limited number of items.  
 like   which gives you top 20 items of a sorted set.
