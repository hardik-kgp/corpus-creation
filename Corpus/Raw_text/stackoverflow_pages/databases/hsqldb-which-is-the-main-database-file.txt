*** hsqldb-which-is-the-main-database-file ***

 I am using HSQLDB in the embedded mode. 
 
 After creating the database, the folder   has the following files: 
 
 My application is working properly 
 But my question is which is the main database file amongst the above-listed files? 
 Or is the main database file stored in some other location? 
 
 **.script**
 contains all the statements to create the tables, alter them and insert the data. This file is created when you use hsqldb in memory. (so I'd say this is your database)
Otherwise the database is stored in  **.data**
 as other people already said 
 **.lck**
 is the lock file by which hsqldb knows whether the database is locked by a process. Usually you have this file only while your program is running and it is automatically deleted when you stop the programm. 
 **.log**
 contains internal log statements of running transactions for example and some commit or rollback points. 
 **.properties**
 contains the properties with which hsqldb is initialized (better don't change anything there if you don't know what you are doing). This is not to be confused with and persistence unit configuration. 
 kind regards 
 
 A file containing your actual data might not exist in your folder for various reasons - particularly if you are using in-memory or non-cached tables. HSQLDB uses the various files you found in its working folder for a variety of reasons. You can read more about their purpose here:  HSQLDB Reference . 
 I paraphrase some of the more relevant information: 
 
 The script file contains the
  definition of tables and other
  database objects, plus the data for
  non-cached tables. The log file
  contains recent changes to the
  database. The data file contains the
  data for cached tables and the backup
  file is a zipped backup of the last
  known consistent state of the data
  file. All these files are essential
  and should never be deleted. If the
  database has no cached tables, the
  test.data and test.backup files will
  not be present. In addition to those
  files, HSQLDB database may link to any
  formatted text files, such as CSV
  lists, anywhere on the disk. 
 While the "test" database is
  operational, a test.log file is used
  to write the changes made to data.
  This file is removed at a normal
  SHUTDOWN. Otherwise (with abnormal
  shutdown) this file is used at the
  next startup to redo the changes. A
  test.lck file is also used to record
  the fact that the database is open.
  This is deleted at a normal SHUTDOWN.
  In some circumstances, a test.data.old
  is created and deleted afterwards. 
 
 
 I think you should have a   file after adding records to database. In the case I'm wrong here are the documentation for you:
