*** html5-websql-how-to-know-when-a-db-transaction-finishes ***

 I've the following code that gets a json recordset and insert some data in three different tables on the client Web Sql storage. 
 How can I intercept the end of databaseSync() function?
What I want to do is display an alert or better an ajax spinner gif in order to inform the user when the sync is complete. 
 Many thanks for your help,
ciao! 
 
 
 Ok, this is my fifth revision, but I liked this question and I keep coming up with better ideas. This one uses  jquery deferred objects  and I think it finally covers all cases and works the way it should. 
 
 For this to work you'll need to change onSuccess and onError to execute the resolve function as a callback function after doing whatever else it is they do and then this should work for you. I hope you find this useful. 
 
 Alternately, you can use one transaction for the bulk insert and use callback function to get notified about completion of the transaction
