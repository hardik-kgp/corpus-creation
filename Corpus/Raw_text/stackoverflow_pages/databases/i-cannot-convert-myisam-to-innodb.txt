*** i-cannot-convert-myisam-to-innodb ***

 I did a wipe and restore. 
 
 I backedup my current innodb tables.  (mysqldump) 
 I loaded it into the database. 
 For some reason...the tables are now all myisam instead of innodb...weird! 
 I try to do: 
 ALTER TABLE xxx ENGINE=innodb; 
 
 And it doesn't do anything to any table. 
 "Show table status" still is "MyISAM" 
 
 
 I see in your   output that InnoDB is disabled in your MySQL install. You need to enable it in order to be able to convert your tables from MyISAM to InnoDB.
