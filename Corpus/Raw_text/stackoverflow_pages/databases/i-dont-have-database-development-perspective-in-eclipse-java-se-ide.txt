*** i-dont-have-database-development-perspective-in-eclipse-java-se-ide ***

 I want to connect a mysql database with eclipse, i have the "java developers" edition of eclipse indigo 3.7.1 and in a lot of tutorials says "open the database development perspective " for connect, but....... 
 I don't have that perspective, in eclipse for java ee developers has that perspective but in my java se ( standard ) no :( 
 How i can get it? 
 Thanks! 
 
 The Java EE Eclipse edition comes with some plugins preinstalled. 
 Install the Database Tools Platform (DTP) Plugin. Here is a  tutorial . 
 
 Another way and for other versions of eclipse such as neon, Click help link on the eclipse app, then click install new sofware 
 
 Then you can be able to install the database development perspective from there 
 
 
 If Database Development Perspective is not listed in your Open Perspective dialog, then you must have to download using Help > Install New Software > Open Work With Combobox Option and choose   or the version like Juno, Kepler, Luna, Mars, Neon, Oxygen, Photan your eclipse version belongs to. 
 
 Just after your selection, eclipse will list the softwares plugins required by you available to the above said url. 
 Simply check the Database Development > Next > Accept the Terms and Conditions > 
Finish and after installation restart your eclipse ide. 
 After restart go and choose your perspective.
