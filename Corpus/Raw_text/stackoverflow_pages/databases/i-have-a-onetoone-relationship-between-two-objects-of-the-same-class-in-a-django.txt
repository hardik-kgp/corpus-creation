*** i-have-a-onetoone-relationship-between-two-objects-of-the-same-class-in-a-django ***

 I have the following in my app: 
 
 I only want a university to be related to one other university in both directions of that relationship. 
 For example, in the database, if I select university A as the sister_university of university B, I only want to be allowed to select university B as the sister_university under university A also. However, as it is, that second relationship is not enforced.  
 For example: Right now, under the Django Admin site, if I first select university A as the sister university of university B, I am still able to select any other university as the sister university of the university A object. I’m not constrained to only selecting university B. 
 Is it possible to enforce that uniqueness at the database level? Is there a better way of accomplishing what I’m trying to do? 
 
 I think that what you need is to make this relationship  **symmetric**
. 
 You can accomplish this by overriding the   method of the   model: 
 
 
 I never did this kind of things, but I think that you can make this process through this way : 
 **Method : unique_together()**

 You can use   and set your university_A and university_B as a unique pair. 
 
 In your models.py file, you should have something like this (with maybe some issues, but the idea is there) : 
 
 You should find precious details there :  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/options/ 
 I never tried this command, but it seems to solve your issue according to your context.
