*** i-need-to-automate-sql-azure-database-backup-in-sql-script-files-how-can-i-do-s ***

 Presently i am generating SQL scripts everyday to take the backup of SQL Azure database. I need to automate this process using some freeware. How can i achieve this? 
 Note:- I need to take the backup in form of SQL Script to some local machine. 
 
 **Option 1: Run some code/script to backup the database**

 You could run the SQL using the SQLCMD utility.  
 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162773.aspx 
 To schedule this, just use the Windows Task Scheduler.

 **Option 2: Use Azure Data Sync**

 Keep a local database in sync with your SQL Azure database, like a constant backup. 
 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh456371.aspx 
 **Option 3: Use BacPac**

 There is an API available in Azure to backup your database to a BACPAC format. 
 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh335292.aspx 
 A RedGate tool then allows you to restore to a local SQL Server.

 **Edit**

 I have since created a command line tool which will create a copy of your database, and back it up to BacPac using the Azure Management API:

 You could try RedGate Azure Sql backup  http://www.red-gate.com/products/dba/sql-azure-backup/ 
 That can be also scheduled using Task Scheduler. 
 I have written some ideas on how to do that:

 SQL Azure Database does not support SQL Server Agent or jobs. You can,
  however, run SQL Server Agent on your on-premise SQL Server and
  connect to SQL Azure Database.

 SQL Server Agent is a Microsoft Windows service that executes
  scheduled administrative tasks, which are called jobs...For example,
  if you want to back up all the company servers every weekday after
  hours, you can automate this task. Schedule the backup to run after
  22:00 Monday through Friday

 Create an in-the-cloud backup of the database (to get a consistent snapshot) and then use the  Data-Tier Application Framework  (DACFx) client tool to copy the snapshot to your local machine, as described in  Automating Windows Azure SQL Database Backup . 
 
 I have come across a free tool that makes backups of your SQL Azure Databases. Backups can be stored locally or on blob. You can also schedule backup operations with its built-in scheduler, or use the Windows Scheduler and the provided command-line utilities.
