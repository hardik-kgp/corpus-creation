 I am looking for a complete list of ICD-9 Codes (Medical Codes) for Diseases and Procedures in a format that can be imported into a database and referenced programmatically. My question is basically exactly the same as  Looking for resources for ICD-9 codes , but the original poster neglected to mention where exactly he "got ahold of" his complete list.   
 Google is definitely not my friend here as I have spent many hours googling the problem and have found many rich text type lists (such as the CDC) or websites where I can drill down to the complete list interactively, but I cannot find where to get the list that would populate these websites and can be parsed into a Database. I believe the files here  ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2009/  have what I am looking for but the files are rich text format and contain a lot of garbage and formatting that would be difficult to remove accurately.  
 I know this has to have been done by others and I am trying to avoid duplicating other peoples effort but I just cannot find an xml/CSV/Excel list. 
 
 Centers for Medicaid & Medicare services provides excel files which contain just the codes and diagnosis, which can be imported directly into some SQL databases, sans conversion.  
 Zipped Excel files, by version number

 After removing the RTF it wasn't too hard to parse the file and turn it into a CSV. My resulting parsed files containing all 2009 ICD-9 codes for Diseases and Procedures are here:  http://www.jacotay.com/files/Disease_and_ProcedureCodes_Parsed.zip 
My parser that I wrote is here:  http://www.jacotay.com/files/RTFApp.zip  
Basically it is a two step process - take the files from the CDC FTP site, and remove the RTF from them, then select the RTF-free files and parse them into the CSV files. 
The code here is pretty rough because I only needed to get the results out once. 
 Here is the code for the parsing app in case the external links go down (back end to a form that lets you select a filename and click the buttons to make it go) 
 
 End Class 
 
 Center for Medicare Services (CMS) is actually charged with ICD, so I think the CDC versions you guys reference may just be copies or reprocessed copies. Here is the (~hard to find) medicare page which i think contains the original raw data ("source of truth").

 It looks like as of this post the latest version is v32. The zip you download will contain 4 plain-text files which map code-to-description (one file for every combination of DIAG|PROC and SHORT|LONG). It also contains two excel files (one each for DIAG_PROC) which have three columns so map code to  both  descriptions (long  and  short). 
 
 Clearly, a very old thread but I recently undertook this task and wrote it up here with links to source data -

 I was trying to get both ICD-9 and ICD-10 into a SQLite database.  
 Seems to have worked well. 
 
 You can get the orginal RTF code files from here
