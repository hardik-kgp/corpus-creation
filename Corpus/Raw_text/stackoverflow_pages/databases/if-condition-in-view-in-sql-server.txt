 Is it possible to have a if condition in VIEWS 
 eg 
 
 
 No I don't believe this is possible.  
 You could use a stored procedure instead to achieve this functionality. 
 
 You could try something sneaky with a UNION : 
 
 This method would require both SELECT statements to return the same set of fields, although their sources might be different. 
 
 Views only allow select statements as stated in  here 
 if you need to do if on column values you can use a  
 
 if your need exceeds this you should create a select from a table valued function instead of a view. 
 What you need is a simple Procedure 
 
 
 simply use a udf (User defined Function)
Here you can use IF, ELSE, WHILE etc.  
 But when you are manipulating data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) then you have to use Stored Procedures because udf's aren't able to do that
