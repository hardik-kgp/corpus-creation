*** illegal-use-of-long-datatype-while-copying-mysql-table-to-oracle ***

 I have a MySQL and a Oracle server. I have to periodically copy some tables from MySQL to Oracle server and this is done via a scheduled PLSQL procedure and for this I have created a DBLINK between MySQL and Oracle. Everything is working fine until I had to copy one table which started giving error  
 Example 
 
 
 " oracle sql error ora-00997 illegal use of long datatype " 
 
 
 I have read couple of comments and this is mostly because of implicit conversion and most of the suggestions were to perform explicit to_lob conversion. But doing anything manual is not a feasible option.  
 Please note that  
 
 work arrangement is such I do not have any access to MySQL server the only thing I get is table name and have DBLINK. So I can only pull data using select statement 
 Solution for above mentioned issue has to be dealt in some kind of automated fix. This is because the request for table copy can be hundreds of table as any given point and I cannot go through all tables to fix/check manually. 
 
 Please help, your expert comments are highly valuable for me. 
 Note :  there are some other questions here which might look similar like

but they don't have the solution to what I am looking for. 
 
 I appreciate that this is rather late, and that I don't have this exact setup.  However, what I have done from Oracle (11gR2) to SQL Server (2008R2 and earlier) is to read INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS through the database link and then dynamically generate a string to EXECUTE IMMEDIATE in PL/SQL. 
 
 I keep a series of templates in a PL/SQL index-by array, with the index being a data type and the value being an expression like   from which the characters   get replaced with the column_name.  If you need to drop a data type entirely, which I often do, I just put an empty string in the data-type array.
