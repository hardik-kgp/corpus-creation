 I have a table named "master" with columns  ,  ,  ,  , and   
 When I fire off a query to get a  Cursor  object for a  CursorAdapter  I get: 
 
 But I don't have a columen named "_id". 
 Can anybody tell me why I am getting this error? 
 Here is the stack trace: 
 
 
 This is happening because   must have an   column in the table it is using. 
 With the Database(SQLite) in Android applications, it is better to add a column named _id" to all tables in order to be able to use  . 
 Alternatively, you can write an sql statement like 
 
 in order to get a   which may be used with  . 
 This is specified in  's  documentation : 
 
 Adapter that exposes data from a Cursor to a ListView widget. The
  Cursor must include a column named "_id" or this class will not work." 
 
 
 Your   tables needs to have a column   defined to be used by SimpleCursorAdaptor. Make sure your table schema includes   and not an   as the later is wrong. 
 
 Simple and Salty  
 To overcome this problem, you have to rename the primary key field name as  . 
 
 I believe the SimpleCursorAdapter assumes that there is a column '_id'. You need to create it so it would probably be easier for you to use "_id" instead of your own "id".
