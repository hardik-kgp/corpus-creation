*** implementing-bulk-record-fetching ***

 At the start of my program, I need to read data from a MS Access database (.mdb) into a drop down control. This is done so that whenever the user types in that control, the application can auto-complete. 
 Anyway, the reading from database took forever so I thought I'd implement bulk row fetching. 
 This is the code I have: 
 
  looks like: 
 
  looks like: 
 
 And in my database, the   looks like: 
 
 All I need to do is only  read  the data from the database. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? My code right now behaves exactly like a normal fetch. There's no bulk fetching happening. 
 **EDIT:**

 I just poked around in   and found out that   initializes my passed   as  ! 
 This means   is only a character array! I need to fetch multiple names, so wouldn't I need a 2D character array? The strangest thing is, the same   initializes my passed   as  . Why in the world would a character array need an array of lengths?! 
 
 You almost got it right. To fetch the values, 
I would change your  
 
 by something like this 
 
 EDIT: To fetch more than one row, remove the CRecordset::forwardOnly option 
 EDIT 2 : You can also keep CRecordset::forwardonly, but add the CRecordset::useExtendedFetch option 
 
 According to  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/77dcbckz.aspx#_core_how_crecordset_supports_bulk_row_fetching  you have to open CRecordset with CRecordset::useMultiRowFetch flag before call SetRowsetSize: 
 
 To implement bulk row fetching, you must specify the
  CRecordset::useMultiRowFetch option in the dwOptions parameter of the
  Open member function. To change the setting for the rowset size, call
  SetRowsetSize. 
 
 
 Just faced the same problem. 
You should use in   call for   parameter only  , and not  .
Hope this helps someone... 
 **EDIT:-**
 After re-check here is the situation - when using bulk recordset and opening with   and  , you must also specify   in  . For other types of scrolling, using   is just fine.
