*** import-csv-into-sqlite-with-autoincrementing-primary-key ***

 I am trying to create a table in sqlite that takes data from a csv file and adds an autoincrementing primary key to the first column.
Here is the table I am trying to insert data into: 
 
 Here is the data in the .csv file 
 
 This is the error I recieve: 
 
 I receive the same error if I have "null" before the first comma in each line.
When I add random numbers before the first comma in each line, I do not get any errors. However, the actual dataset I need to work with may be much larger and therefore, I can't simply manually add in a unique primary key for each entry. I'd really appreciate some help with this

 Import into a temporary table without that column, then copy the data over with: 
 
 
 You can add a column with the primary keys in your text file, then import it.
Note: If you get that error on the first column, make sure your file does not have the BOM. If it has the BOM (3 bytes at the beginning of the file), it will fail on the first row. 
 1: INSERT failed: datatype mismatch
