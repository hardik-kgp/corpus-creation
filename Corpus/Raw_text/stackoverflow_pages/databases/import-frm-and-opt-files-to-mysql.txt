*** import-frm-and-opt-files-to-mysql ***

 I am using MySQL 5.5.1.1 downloaded and installed from :  http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ 
 I want to import .frm and .opt database files from my local machine to my mysql database. 
 I created a new Databbase connection to help me import the files from my machine. But I am unable to import .frm files as I keep getting error message: Format not supported. 
 Can someone please help me on how I could import files to MySQL client?? 
 Thank you,

 As far importing any MySQL data, three(3) things need to considered. 
 MyISAM 
 Importing a MyISAM table is a simple as moving three files with the extensions  ,  , and   files for the given table into a MySQL folder. For example, if the table name is mydata, then the three(3) files 
 
 
 
 
 
 The following could be the nightmare of nightmares. Importing InnoDB depends entirely on many factors that fall into one of two categories: 
 InnoDB ( innodb_file_per_table  disabled [default]) 
 All InnoDB data and index pages are located in  . This file must be moved from your source machine (Server-S) to the target machine (Server-T) and placed in the same absolute path. In fact, here is the shocker: Server-S and Server-T must be the same. In other words, you cannot import and export InnoDB   files to other machines. They can only be imported and exported on the same machine the   was created on. 
 You would also have to move /var/ib/mysql/ib_logfile0 and /var/ib/mysql/ib_logfile1 from Server-S and place them in the same absolute path on Server-T. 
 You also must make sure that every InnoDB variable set in /etc/my.cnf from Server-S must be set in /etc/my.cnf on Server-T. 
 InnoDB ( innodb_file_per_table  enabled) 
 For every InnoDB table, there will be two files. For example, if the InnoDB table in the mydata database is called mytable, you will have   and /var/lib/mysql/mydata/mytable.ibd. The   file contains data and index pages for the table. To import the individual table you must 
 
 Place the   in   on Server-T 
 Place the   in   on Server-T 
 Run  
 
 Make sure you have the   in the same place it was imported from. 
 Moral of the story 
 Please do not use IMPORT TABLESPACE techniques across different servers. Just do a mysqldump of everything and import the mysqldump. Logical dumps are always the safest way to go !!! 
 
 I did a mysql import using the files on xampp. I have very many databases so I did not want to go through the mysqldump route. The process was: 
 
 Install the new xampp, but do not enable the services 
 Update  **my.ini**
 to include any custom settings I had on the previous install.  
 Confirm that mysql is starting successfully 
 Copy over all the database folders (inside the data folder) from the old install with the exception of  **mysql**
,  **phpmyadmin**
 and  **webauth**
. 
 Confirm that mysql is starting successfully 
 Copy over  **ib_logfile0**
,  **ib_logfile1**
 and  **ibdata1**
. Rename the files first, do not overwrite just in case something goes wrong. 
 Confirm that mysql is starting successfully 
 Copy over the following files from the  **data/mysql**
 folder:  **db.frm**
,  **db.MYD**
,  **db.MYI**
,  **user.frm**
,  **user.MYD**
,  **user.MYI**
. Do not overwrite the new ones just in case it doesn't work. 
 Confirm that mysql is starting successfully 
 
 At the end of the process I had mysql working perfectly with all my databases and users intact. 
 
 Just copy desired 'data' folder to target mysql data folder, after renaming current 'data' folder, after stop mysql service. And export to sql file with phpmyadmin, and restore current data folder, and import desired data sql. 
 
 I think the great problem you may be experiencing comes from the fact that you cannot even view these .frm files in the phpmyadmin interface (because they really are incomplete sets). I'd suggest you delete these files from the current location and use phpmyadmin to re-create the these tables as SQL under "query" tab [delete IFF you do have database script of everything. if not, you may still get this from the old dump. if not gaian, do NOT delete).
