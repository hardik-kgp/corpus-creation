 When I try to run the command: 
 
 I get the error: 
 
 So far I have tried   and have referenced (with no luck): 
 psycopg2 installation error - Library not loaded: libssl.dylib

 Psycopg2 image not found 
 
 Instead of playing with symlinks in system library dirs, set the   to include the anaconda libraries. eg:

 I ran into this exact issue about an hour after you posted it and just figured it out. I am using Mac OS X Yosemite, Python 2.7, and the Postgresql app. 
 There seems to be a non-working symlink set by default (or I introduced it while troubleshooting), to fix it first remove the incorrect links: 
 
 Then re-link them with (replace YOURUSERNAME with your Mac user name. I found it helpful to use tab to complete each step, to confirm the directory): 
 
 I believe the other solutions didn't work for you because your version is in anaconda. 
 
 After bashing my head against the wall for a couple hours, these two solutions are guaranteed to work: 
 **Option 1.**
 This solves our problem without messing around with environment variables. Run this in your shell: 
 
 Boom! This upgrades the symbolic links in   for   and  . Now   works like a charm. 
 **Option 2.**
 If for some reason you would like to maintain the current symbolic links in  , run this command in your shell: 
 
 Just make sure to replace   above with the actual lib path. In my case, this was  . 
 This will only work for the shell/bash session you're currently in. To make the change persistent, add the   statement to your   or   file. 
 **Thoughts:**
 IMO #1 is the proper way to deal with this problem, but I left #2 in case some people prefer working with environment variables rather than fixing symbolic links (if, for example, they have software with a dependency on the older openssl file versions). 
 
 After Homebrew wouldn't allow me to force link   the following worked fine: 
 
 (this installation succeeded in a   on macOS) 
 
 conda install psycopg works for me. It updates the following packages
The following packages will be UPDATED: 
 
 
 In relation to X.L.'s answer above, I didn't want to use Anaconda when I'm already using pip, so I just gave it the path to the Postgres libraries which worked for me (I'm using PostgreSQL.app on Mac OS 10.10)... 
 
 
 I had to vary Scott Brennstuhl's answer a little: 
1. Remove broken symlinks: 
 
 
 Relink with postgres' included drivers: 
 
 
 
 My flavor of setup was a little different than the OP: I'm using   on Mac and am within a  ; but the symptoms were similar. 
 For me, this occurred right after updating my   from 9.3 to 9.5 on my local, and the error clearly showed the   path for   was pointing to the old 9.3 data directory location (the   referenced in this error?). Adding weird things to my   or removing symlinks I'm not sure the impact of definitely didn't feel right to me. I solved it by uninstalling then re-installing   the same way I had when it was working - something that doesn't feel very dangerous at all: 
 
 Then I was all good! 
 
 Do the following to resolve Library not loaded:libssl.1.0.0.dylib error  **if you have openssl in /usr/local/Cellar directory**
  
 
 
 sudo cp /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/<< version >>/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib  
 After doing step 1, if you still get Library not loaded:libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib error. Do the following  
      sudo cp /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/<< version >>/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib 
 
 
 
 I was having this issue on Mac, trying ln -s was giving me 
ln: /usr/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib: Operation not permitted
I didn't want to mess with my system. Instead What worked for me is to simply install psycopg2-binary :
pip install psycopg2-binary   
 This installed  **psycopg2-binary-2.8.3**
 version 
 
 I tried pip install psycopg2 which was giving similar issues.
Then I tried conda install psycopg2, which worked!
Also make sure the pip you are using belongs to anaconda (which pip) 
 
 After trying for more than a day I came to the below solution. 
 
 brew reinstall openssl@1.0 
 disable csrutil -> google it how to disable it, so that we could copy something 
to /usr/lib 
 copy libssl.1.0.0.dylib to /usr/lib 
     I did- sudo cp 
           /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2s/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib 
 copy libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib to /usr/lib
     I did- sudo cp 
            /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2s/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib 
 
 Similarly, if you face issue for  **Library not loaded: libssl.1.0.0.dylib**

just change the version from 1.0 to 1.1 of openssl and copy libssl.1.1 instead libssl.1.0 and libcrypto.1.1 instead libcrypto.1.0.0 
 Done you are all set to enjoy psycopg2 in mac. 
 
 The solution that worked for me ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/30726895  did not) was installing   with:  
 This is on MacOS Mohave.  
 
 I am using Mac OS Sierra:
and got this error:  
 
 I found this library in  
 
 I found this solution in internet:  
 
 But this is not a permanent solution. As I have to run the above command whenever I restart my server. 
 Add the line: 
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL//lib 
to 
~/.bash_profile 
 
  did the trick for me 
 
 Homebrew upgrades default openssl from v1.0 to v1.1. If you tried @Scott solution to upgrade openssl: 
 
 you may run into ssh problem. You need to upgrade openssh as well.
