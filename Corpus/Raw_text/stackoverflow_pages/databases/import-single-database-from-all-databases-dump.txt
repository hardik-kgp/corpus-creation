*** import-single-database-from-all-databases-dump ***

 Is it possible to import a single database from an --all-databases mysqldump? I guess I can modify the file manually but wondering if there are any command line options to do this. 
 I am moving servers and have a lot of databases, most of which I don't currently need or want at the moment but would like to have the option to restore a single one if need be. 
 
  output is just a set of   statements. 
 You can provide the desired database in the command line and skip the commands against the other databases using: 
 
 This will only execute the commands when   is in use 
 
 You can use the following command: 
 
 Where   is your desired database which you want to restore. 
 Another option which is IMHO much safer, is to extract the DB from an   dump. Example: 
 
 Replace   with the desired database name.   is the name of your sql-dump file. That way you'll have the seperated DB on file, and then you can restore using a simple mysql command. 
 Good luck
