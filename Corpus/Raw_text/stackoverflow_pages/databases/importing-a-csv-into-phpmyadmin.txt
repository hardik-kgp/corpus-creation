*** importing-a-csv-into-phpmyadmin ***

 I have a CSV that looks like this, 
 
 Is it possible to just insert this data into the existing columns in my database, all I can seem to it insert it as a new table which then has columns name A, B, C , D, E etc. 
 
 In phpMyAdmin, click the table, and then click the Import tab at the top of the page. 
 Browse and open the csv file. Leave the charset as-is. Uncheck partial import unless you have a HUGE dataset (or slow server). The format should already have selected “CSV” after selecting  your file, if not then select it (not using LOAD DATA). If you want to clear the whole table before importing, check “Replace table data with file”. Optionally check “Ignore duplicate rows” if you think you have duplicates in the CSV file. Now the important part, set the next four fields to these values: 
 
 Currently these match the defaults except for “Fields terminated by”, which defaults to a semicolon.  
 Now click the Go button, and it should run successfully. 
 
 Using the   SQL statement you can import the CSV file, but you can't update data. However, there is a trick you can use. 
 
 Create another temporary table to use for the import 
 Load onto this table from the CSC 
 
 UPDATE the real table joining the table 
 
 
 
 In phpMyAdmin v.4.6.5.2 there's a checkbox option " **The first line of the file contains the table column names....**
" :  
 
 
 This is happen due to the id(auto increment filed missing). If you edit it in a text editor by adding a comma for the ID field this will be solved.
