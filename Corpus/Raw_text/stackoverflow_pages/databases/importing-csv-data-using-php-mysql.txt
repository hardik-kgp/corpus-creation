*** importing-csv-data-using-php-mysql ***

 I'm having a bit of a problem trying to import data from a CSV and have a couple of questions on it that I haven't managed to solve myself yet. 
 First off here's my code to help put things in perspective (tidied it up a bit, removing CSS and DB connection): 
 
 It's basically an adaptation of an example I have found after many many attempts at various methods. 
 My CSV has two columns of data, the first one being text and the second is integers
The table in the database also has two columns, the first called "text" and the second "number" 
 So the questions I have are: 
 
 the text being uploaded is just being displayed as 0 in every field and i'm not sure why 
 I keep reading about data ending up enclosed in "", if that happens how would I sort it? 
 how can I ignore the first X lines of the CSV for headers etc? 
 is the data format changed throughout this process or is it ready for me to use in a graph? e.g. would a decimal stay a decimal once placed in the database? 
 
 I think that covers everything, thanks in advance for any help! 
 EDIT: 
 Just done a test of 10,000 record uploading and got the error:  
 "Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded"  
 any thoughts? 
 
 I answered a virtually identical question just the other day:  Save CSV files into mysql database 
 MySQL has a feature  , which allows it to import a CSV file directly in a single SQL query, without needing it to be processed in a loop via your PHP program at all. 
 Simple example: 
 
 It's as simple as that. 
 No loops, no fuss. And much  much  quicker than parsing it in PHP.

 Hope that helps 
 
 
 
 letsay $infile = a.csv //file needs to be imported. 
 
 hope this helps. 
 
 
 
 i think the main things to remember about parsing csv is that it follows some simple rules: 
 a)it's a text file so easily opened
b) each row is determined by a line end \n so split the string into lines first
c) each row/line has columns determined by a comma so split each line by that to get an array of columns 
 have a read of this post  to see what i am talking about  
 it's actually very easy to do once you have the hang of it and becomes very useful.
