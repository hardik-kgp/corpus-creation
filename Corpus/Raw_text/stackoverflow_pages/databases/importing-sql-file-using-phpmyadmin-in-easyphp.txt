*** importing-sql-file-using-phpmyadmin-in-easyphp ***

 I have a website written in php and mysql (written by someone else) and I need to alter it- just for your interest it is bridgetjonesart.co.uk. So I thought I would download it to my desktop pc and use easy php and mysql locally to make changes then upload it again. 
 I have the sql database as a file 'runningc_bjart.sql' in the root directory. I first use php admin to create a database of the same name as the orginal  and then use import ... one table appears to be created but then getting an error...
Error 
 
 I am not sure what to try next, any help would be really appreciated.
Thank you. Bridget 
 
 Having wasted many hours, I have a solution so here it is. 
 Having a look on the web I found I needed to change my   file in the phpadmin directory  as I was running EasyPHP 13.1 password slightly diff to that mentioned in the blog at  http://amir-shenodua.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/error-while-importing-db-in-mysql.html . I added 2 lines: 
 
 So all sorted !! Yippee!!  
 So if you have trouble please read:

 For temporary relief: 
 Comment out this line in your config.inc.php file (place   before the line) 
 
 Then close all browsers. Try importing again. 
 
 As an alternative to modifying phpMyAdmin's   as proposed in other answers, if you have shell access then you can directly execute this file using the MySQL console client. 
 First, change directories to the folder containing your DDL script  
 Then run this command, replacing the values for host, user, password, and database name: 
 
 This ran just fine without the error received when importing via phpMyAdmin
