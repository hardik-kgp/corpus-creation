*** in-android-check-if-sqlite-database-exists-fails-from-time-to-time ***

 In Android I use the following method to see if the sqlite database exist and if I can open it and use it.  
 If it fail this test I copy the database file from the assets (this should only happen once, when the user first start the app). 
 
 The problem is that I get reports from users saying that their data has been wiped out and when investigating I can see that the database is replaced with the database from the assets. So for some reason even if the user already has a database file sometimes the SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase() throws an error. I haven't been able to reproduce the issue myself but it seems to happen for some users. 
 Anyone have an idea what the problem might be here? Is there a better way to do this test? 
 
 How about just checking the filesystem to see if the database exists instead of trying to open it first?  
 You could be trying to open a database that is already open and that will throw an error causing you to think it does not exist. 
 
 
 I want to share a method to check if database exists:
Give me a +1 if it runs fine for you,
Thanks.
