*** in-jdbc-when-to-use-time-date-and-timestamp ***

 JDBC offers me 3 different datatypes for time-related fields: "Date", "Time" and "Timestamp". Can someone provide a simple summary of what each one is used for and how to choose which to use for a given problem? 
 
 Let's assume you have the date/time January 1, 2003 2:00pm stored in a database column.  The three options are used as follows: 
 Use Date if you are only interested in the date portion of the date string. 
 
 ex: January 1, 2003 
 
 Use Time if you are only interested in the time portion of the date string 
 
 ex: 2:00pm 
 
 Use Timestamp if you want the date and time of the date string 
 
 ex: January 1, 2003 2:00pm
