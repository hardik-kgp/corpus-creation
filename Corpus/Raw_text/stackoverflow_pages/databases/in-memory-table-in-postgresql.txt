 How can I create an in-memory table in PostgreSQL? 
 
 Create a RAM disk using software appropriate to your OS. Use   to  create  a DB cluster on the RAM disk. When you  create  your table, use the   clause. Obviously, your RAM tables will not persist across system reboots unless you save the RAM disk. 
 
 Well, it's not technically a  **in memory**
 table, but, you can create a global temporary table: 
 
 It's not guaranteed that it will remain in memory the whole time, but it probably will (unless is a huge table). 
 You can also consider PostgreSQL 9.1's unlogged tables, which will give you better performance at the cost of not being able to be part of transactions (their write operations are not maintained in WAL).

 I plan to try this, and thought it deserved it's own answer for users to vote on this option (i.e. the "long tail").
