  results in pretty-print json object. 
  results in jarbled json object. 
 How can I make   the same as  , when it comes to display in the mongo shell? 
 
 If you are scripting using javascript, you can use dcrosta's answer.
But if you want to pretty print directly on the mongo interactive shell, you have to append pretty() to your find() queries.  
 Type on the shell:
 
 
 The cursor object returned by   supports  , so you can use: 
 
 However note that, unlike the default output of   which shows the first 10 objects then lets you choose whether to continue iterating or not,   will iterate the entire result set. Thus if your query returns many results, this may take a while and may not be terribly helpful.   is your friend here. 
 
 The correct answer is already provided with the use of  . 
 However just as a side note, you can also call .toArray() on the cursor to get the documents as javascript array of JSON. 
 
 
 It may not have been available at the time the question was asked, but to make the default output for all   queries to be pretty, I use: 
 
 I also add the following: 
 
 which enables me to uglify the results of a single   query using: 
 
 I typically add both prototype declarations into my   file so they are available in all mongo cli shells.
