*** in-mysql-how-to-copy-the-content-of-one-table-to-another-table-within-the-same ***

 I am new to MySQL. I would like to copy the content of one table to another table within the same database. Basically, I would like to insert to a table from another table. Is there easy way of doing this? 
 
 
 EDIT: or if the tables have different structures you can also: 
 
 EDIT: to constrain this.. 
 
 
 If the table doesn't exist, you can create one with the same schema like so: 
 
 Then, to copy the data over: 
 
 
 If table1 is large and you don't want to lock it for the duration of the copy process, you can do a dump-and-load instead: 
 
 
 This worked for me, 
 
 Replicates newtable with old table

 If you want to create and copy the content in a single shot, just use the SELECT: 
 
 CREATE TABLE new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl; 
 
 
 This worked for me. You can make the SELECT statement more complex, with WHERE and LIMIT clauses.  
 First duplicate your large table (without the data), run the following query, and then truncate the larger table. 
 
 Super simple. :-) 
 
 Try this. Works well in my Oracle 10g,
