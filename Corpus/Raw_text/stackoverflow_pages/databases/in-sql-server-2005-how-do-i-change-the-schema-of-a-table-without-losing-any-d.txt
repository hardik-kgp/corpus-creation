 I have a table that got into the "db_owner" schema, and I need it in the "dbo" schema. 
 Is there a script or command to run to switch it over? 
 
 In SQL Server Management Studio: 
 
 Right click the table and select modify (it's called "Design" now) 
 On the properties panel choose the correct owning schema. 
 
 
 
 
 Show all   by this select: 
 
 You can use this query to change all schema for all tables to dbo table schema: 
 
 
 simple answer 
 
 you don't need to stop all connections to the database, this can be done on the fly. 
 
 A  **slight**
 improvement to sAeid's excellent answer... 
 I added an exec to have this code self-execute, and I added a union at the top so that I could change the schema of both tables AND stored procedures: 
 
 I too had to restore a dbdump, and found that the schema wasn't dbo - I spent hours trying to get Sql Server management studio or visual studio data transfers to alter the destination schema...  I ended up just running this against the restored dump on the new server to get things the way I wanted. 
 
 When I use SQL Management Studio I do not get the 'Modify' option, only 'Design' or 'Edit'. If you have Visual Studio (I have checked VS.NET 2003, 2005 & 2008) you can use the Server Explorer to change the schema.  Right click on the table and select 'Design Table' (2008) or 'Open Table Definition' (2003, 2005). Highlight the complete "Column Name" column.  You can then right click and select 'Property Pages' or Properties (2008).  From the property sheet you should see the 'Owner' (2003 & 2005) or 'Schema' (2008) with a drop down list for possible schemas. 
 
 I use this for situations where a bunch of tables need to be in a different schema, in this case the dbo schema. 
 
 
 You need to firstly stop all connections to the database, change the ownership of the tables that are 'db_owner' by running the command  
 
 where ? is the table name.
