 **Incorrect datetime value 0000-00-00 00:00:00 +0000 Database Error Number: 1292**

 Hi Everyone I'm having a problem a with a server upgrade done by my hosting company and I'm trying to understand what is occurring so i can fix the problem 
 My sever has recently been upgraded to Server version: 5.6.17 and I'm getting errors all over the place saying my datetime value is incorrect? 
 It seem to be add +0000 to the end of the datetime but I'm not sure why. This used to work perfectly fine on 5.5 but a recent upgrade has affected how my timestamps work 
 
 If I modify this sql query without +0000 it works? 
 It affects anything that is a type of DATETIME on my table. 
 Has anyone else had a similar problem and now what the solution is to get this to work. At the moment I'm thing I will have to change all my PHP functions to echo the Date/Time rather than me calling NOW() on the query string 
 
 I discovered after upgrading to MySQL 5.7 that this error started occurring in random situations, even when I wasn't supplying a date in the query. 
 This appears to be because  previous  versions of MySQL supported dates like   (by default) however 5.7.4 introduced some changes to the   setting. If you still have old data present when using a newer MySQL version, then random errors may crop up. 
 I needed to perform a query like this to reset all the zero dates to another date. 
 
 Alternatively, you may be able to adjust the   setting, although note what the docs say about it: 
 
 The   mode affects whether the server permits '0000-00-00' as a valid date. Its effect also depends on whether strict SQL mode is enabled. 
 
 If this mode is not enabled, '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce no warning. 
 If this mode is enabled, '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce a warning. 
 If this mode and strict mode are enabled, '0000-00-00' is not permitted and inserts produce an error, unless IGNORE is given as well. For   and  , '0000-00-00' is permitted and inserts produce a warning. 
 
 As of MySQL 5.7.4,   is deprecated. In MySQL 5.7.4 through 5.7.7,   does nothing when named explicitly. Instead, its effect is included in the effects of strict SQL mode. In MySQL 5.7.8 and later,   does have an effect when named explicitly and is not part of strict mode, as before MySQL 5.7.4. However, it should be used in conjunction with strict mode and is enabled by default. A warning occurs if   is enabled without also enabling strict mode or vice versa. For additional discussion, see SQL Mode Changes in MySQL 5.7. 
 Because   is deprecated, it will be removed in a future MySQL release as a separate mode name and its effect included in the effects of strict SQL mode.

 Ok, so I was having this same error. What I did to fix it was use these lines of code to query the database I was having issues with: 
 
 The first line of code (SELECT) is to see what the current setting are for both 'SESSION' and 'GLOBAL'. Once you set them both to empty strings and run the select again, they should return nothing (be empty). 
 You may also need to use   but this resolved the issue for me. Basically one of the settings in there was jacking up the way the date was coming into the database (I was getting it in a 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM' format). Deleting   and the other date option didn't help me. 
 My site is working like it's supposed to now. Hopefully this helps. 
 
 Short answer -   in your query should work perfectly well with a MySQL   column. 
 Longer answer - I'm not sure how you ever saw   working.  The   column is formatted as  .  When it comes to timezone differences, it's generally something you need to handle programmatically.  MySQL does convert local times to UTC and back again when storing and retrieving   data - but it doesn't do this with   or other Date / Time columns.

 The   data type is used for values that contain both date and time parts.   has a range of   to  . 
 The   type is used for values that contain both date and time parts. MySQL retrieves and displays   values in   format. The supported range is  . 
 **you should use this type in: DateTime format**

 update: 1 
 you should remove the   like your code   and change the code like   as full query is following as:

 Original my.cnf had sql_model set as follows: 
 
 I tried removing NO_ZERO_IN_DATE and NO_ZERO_DATE but it had no effect. But if I removed all terms (sql_mode empty) the error went away. 
 I went back to original sql_mode and thought I would remove terms 1-by-1 to see which one was cause. First attempt was to remove STRICT_TRANS_TABLES: 
 
 No error.  So it appears that STRICT_TRANS_TABLES was the cause.
