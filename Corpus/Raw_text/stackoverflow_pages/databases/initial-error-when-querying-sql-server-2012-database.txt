*** initial-error-when-querying-sql-server-2012-database ***

 Using SQL Server 2012, I created a database and a table: 
 
 When I query the table the first time (after I connect to SQL Server) using this query: 
 
 I get 
 
 Msg 2809, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 
  The request for procedure 'Downloads' failed because 'Downloads' is a table object. 
 
 But the second time I execute the same   statement, it runs correctly 
 How do I eliminate this error the first time around? 
 
 You had the text   selected in Management Studio. This causes the T-SQL string   to be executed. Such a T-SQL batch is interpreted as a procedure call. 
 
 I made one column a primary key, now this issue disappeared.
