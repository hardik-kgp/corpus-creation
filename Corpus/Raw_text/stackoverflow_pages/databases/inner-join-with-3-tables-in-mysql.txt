*** inner-join-with-3-tables-in-mysql ***

 I want to select data from more tables with Inner join. 
 These are my tables. 
 
 I want to write a statement that shows which exam, grade and date alle the students have been to. Sorted after date. 
 This is my statement.  It runs, but i want to make sure that i am doing it correctly. 
 
 
 Almost correctly.. Look at the joins, you are referring the wrong fields 
 
 
 The correct statement should be :  
 
 A table is refered to other on the basis of the foreign key relationship defined. You should refer the ids properly if you wish the data to show as queried. So you should refer the id's to the proper foreign keys in the table rather than just on the id which doesn't define a proper relation
