*** insert-data-into-hive-table ***

 Using a Cygwin distribution, I've installed Hadoop 0.20.3 and Hive 0.11.0. 
 First of all, I don't understand how to use the Hive CLI: 
 
 Then enter and nothing happens. I can execute queries using  
 Then, I've created a table: 
 
 But how can I insert data into this table? I see some   examples but when I try: 
 
 I've got an error: 
 
 How can I append data in my table? 
 
 You can insert new data into table by two ways. 
 
 Load the data of a file into table using  load  command. 
 
 You can insert new data into table by using  select  query. 
 
 
 
 If you already have a table pre_loaded_tbl with some data. You can use a trick to load the data into your table with following query 
 
 Also please note that "my_data" is independent of any data in the pre_loaded_tbl. You can select any data and write any column name (here my_data and my_column). Hive does not require it to have same column name. However structure of select statement should be same as that of your tweet_table. You can use limit to determine how many times you can insert into the tweet_table. 
 However if you haven't' created any table, you will have to load the data using file copy or load data commands in above answers.  
 
 Try to use this with single quotes in data: 
 
 
 If table is without partition then code will be, 
 Insert into table   select col_a,col_b,col_c from    
 --here any condition can be applied such as limit, group by, order by etc... 
 If table is with partitions then code will be, 
 set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true; 
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict; 
 insert into table   partition( ,  ) 
select col_a,col_b,col_c,partition_col1,partition_col2
from    
 --here any condition can be applied such as limit, group by, order by etc... 
 
 I faced similar problem so I used impala to insert the single row into my table and it worked for the same query. This will work for sure. 
 
 Although there is an accepted answer I would want to add that as of Hive 0.14, record level operations are allowed. The correct syntax and query would be:
