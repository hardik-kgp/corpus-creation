 How to insert records in one to one relationship? 
 lets say i have 3 tables : table A , table B, table C 
 I have to insert a record into those tables which table A is referenced as the main table for primary key. 
 Lets just say like this: 
 
 Now, 
 when I am inserting records in tableB or tableC the error occurs: 
 
 But when I am inserting in tableA which is the basis of the two tables' primary keys, it is ok and it increments. 
 How would I insert a record? Specifically in JPA. 
 
 Do I need to insert into tableA first then insert in others? (Just did that and it does not work) 
 Do I need to insert data in the tables at the same time? (How? in JPA will be good) 
 
 
 Here again my comment as an answer 
 since you have a reference in tableB and tableC to tableA, you have to insert tableA first and retreive the generated PK. Then you can insert in any of the other tables with the retrieved ID. For JPA have a look here:  How to get Id of last persisted entity using JPA 
 And here is an example how to achieve this in sql server:

 this is a basic in relational databases and foreign keys, i didnt read the wiki article, but it have to mention same the thinkg:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key
