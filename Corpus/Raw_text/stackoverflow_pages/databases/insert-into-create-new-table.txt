*** insert-into-create-new-table ***

 I have two large tables and want to combine all of the column names (not as a view) into a new table.  
 I  **do not have permission**
 to right click on each table and choose CREATE TO SCRIPT, so I was wondering if there is a way to INSERT both Tables into a new table without specifying the column data types? 
 
 
 
 For T-SQL, 
 
 
 You can use a   TSQL query - see  MSDN link . 
 
 If you have create rights you should be able to use an: 
  statement to do this. 
 EDIT: 
 I had it wrong
