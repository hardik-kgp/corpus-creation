*** insert-manually-into-a-table-by-sql-statement-but-key-is-autoincremented ***

 Let's say I have a table of users and the   column is the primary key and auto incremented.  
 I want to just try and add user manually by this statement: 
 
 but I don't want to specify the   value, just want to add to the next row. 
 Thanks everyone, I forgot to set the id column to auto increment. it works now. 
 
 So just don't use it...do it like this.. 
 And be sure you use single quotes for inserting  
 
 As you said your field is  , SQL will automatically increment the value of the   field by 1 
 
 If you want to manually insert a value to an auto incremented column you can use the IDENTITY_INSERT of sql. for example 
 
 you can read more here
 IDENTITY_INSERT 
 
 If id is a auto incremented value just leave that column out of the insert and it will fill in with the auto incremented value. For example from BOL  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933196(v=SQL.80).aspx 
 
 
 This should do the job for you: 
 
 The autoincrement value will be automatically added by SQL.
