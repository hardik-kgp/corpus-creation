*** insert-tsv-files-into-postgresql-db ***

 I have several files which are saved as tsv. I want to insert them into a   db, to analyze them with sql. 
 However, my problem is how to   this tsv files into   under  ?

 the file is in the directory: 
 
 
 For tab separated values, you can use COPY:

 The   is required, otherwise you'll get an error like this:

 If the columns in your TSV don't line up perfectly with your table, you can also define the mapping by doing the following: 
 
 
 I'm able to do this with  csvsql  from  csvkit . 
 To read a TSV (or CSV) and create/insert it to a table, my command line script looks like this: 
 
 
 Sad to say, but the easiest way is to convert the TSV to a CSV. Most of the built in Postgres import utilities to do things like converting empty strings to nulls, skipping headers, etc are  **Only for CSV**
. 
 See this simple  6 line Python answer on SO . I use it and then CSV loaded like normal without a problem in Postgres after trying for and hour to load a TSV.
