*** inserting-data-to-table-mysqli-insert ***

 I've been looking at this code for a while now and I can't see where the problem is. I have been reading the whole of StackOverflow and still can't see where my error is.  
 
 The error is somewhere in line 13, thats  . I tried to help myself with  http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_insert.asp  but it's not helping me much. 
 
 **Warning:**
 Never ever refer to  w3schools  for learning purposes. They have so many mistakes in their tutorials.

 **Note:**
 Add backticks ` for column names in your insert query as some of your column names are reserved words. 
 
 In mysqli_query(first parameter should be connection,your sql statement)
so 
 
 but best practice is 
 
 
 Okay, of course the question has been answered, but no-one seems to notice the third line of your code. It continuosly bugged me.  
 
 for some reason, you made a mysqli connection to server, but you are trying to make a mysql connection to database.To get going, rather use 
 
 or for where i began 
 
 or just query with a $connection parameter as the other argument like above. Get rid of that third line. 
 
 While using php mysqli functions, keep in mind that the connection details are mentioned first then the query is passed in the function 
 
 Keep in mind the $cid is the variable which holds the connection data in the above codes.  
 
 What about this? 
 
 
 if one of your columns like   are autoincrement, you should not assign value for it. just put   for its value.
