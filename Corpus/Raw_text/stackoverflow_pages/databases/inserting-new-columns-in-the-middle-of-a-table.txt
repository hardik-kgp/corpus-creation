*** inserting-new-columns-in-the-middle-of-a-table ***

 When one uses "ALTER TABLE tab ADD col", the new column gets added to the end of the table. For example: 
 
 table will become 
 
 However as the naming of my example columns suggests I'd actually like the table to end up like this: 
 
 With COL_3 before COL_4. 
 Besides rebuilding the table from scratch, is there any standard SQL that will get the job done? However if there is no standard SQL, I could still use some vendor dependent solutions for Oracle, but again a standard solution would be best. 
 Thanks. 
 
 By default, columns are only added at the end. 
 To insert a column in the middle, you have to drop and recreate the table and all related objects (constraints, indices, defaults, relationships, etc). 
 Several tools do this for you, and depending on the size of the table, this may be an intensive operation. 
 You may also consider creating views on the table that display columns in the order of preferrence (overriding the actual order in the table). 
 
 It works. 
 
 
 http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SQL_FAQ#How_does_one_add_a_column_to_the_middle_of_a_table.3F  says it can't be done, and suggests workarounds of renaming the table and doing a   or (something I am unfamiliar with) "Use the DBMS_REDEFINITION package to change the structure". 
 
 
 ALTER TABLE TABLENAME 
  ALTER COLUMN COLUMNNAME 
  POSITION X; 
 
 
 I know it's old subject (2009) but maybe it will help someone that still looks for an answer. In MySQL, it works 2 add a column anywhere in the table. 
 
 This is 2 enter a text column, but u can set whatever properties u want for the new column, just make sure u write them with caps.  
 I found it with Xampp, MySQL admin, when i used it 2 insert a column in the middle of a MySQL table. 
 Hope it helps. 
 
 As per my small research the only way is to create the views of the previous table in a required order of columns or else recreate the table from the scratch and in some sql query tools the 'AFTER' keyword might work".
