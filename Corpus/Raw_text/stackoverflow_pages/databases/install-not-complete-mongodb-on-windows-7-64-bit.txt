 image of the problem 
 how to solve this problem   
 
 I too have the same issue while installing mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-3.6.3-signed.msi 
 Follow the below steps to resolve the problem 
 
 Run the installer with a double-click. 
 Click next. 
 Accept the License Agreement. 
 Select the Complete installation type and click Install 
 Uncheck the Install Compass option (by default this checked and Compass requires the Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later) 
 With in a minute time installation will get complete and you can see the exe files under C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin 
 
 You can follow the url  https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/  for installing Compass (The GUI for MongoDB) later.
