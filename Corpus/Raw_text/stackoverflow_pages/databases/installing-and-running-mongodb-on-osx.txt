*** installing-and-running-mongodb-on-osx ***

 If someone can provide some insights here I would GREATLY appreciate it.  
 I am new to MongoDB, and (relatively) new to the command line.  
 I had a express/node.js app running on MongoDB locally successfully, but upon restarting my computer, I attempted to restart the Mongo server and it began giving errors and wouldn't start. Since then, I have re-installed Mongo several times only to find the same error occurring. this is what I am receiving: 
 
 Am I missing a step? Should I be creating a config file? Some basic guidance would be really helpful. Thanks in advance for any insights. 
 
 Assuming you have created the data/db directory under bin after install.  
 
 Start a terminal for your mongo server 
 Go to   directory 
 Run the command 
 ./mongod 
 Start a terminal for your mongo shell 
 Go to   directory 
 Run the command (make sure you put the name of the database) 
 ./mongo test 
 
 
 If you have installed mongodb through   then you can simply start mongodb through 
 
 Then access the shell by  
 
 You can shut down your db by 
 
 You can restart your db by

 **Updated answer (9/2/2019):**

 Homebrew has removed mongodb formula from its core repository, see  this pull request . 
 The new way to install mongodb using Homebrew is as follows: 
 
 After installation you can start the mongodb service by following the caveats:

 I assume you are using Homebrew. You can see the additional information that you need using  
 
 Caveats is what you need to follow after installation. 
 
 Problem here is you are trying to open a mongo shell without starting a mongo db which is listening to port 127.0.0.1:27017(deafault for mongo db) thats what the error is all about: 
 
 The easiest solution is to open the terminal and type 
 
 Note: dbpath here is "Users/user" where data/db directories are created 
 i.e., you need to create directory  **data**
 and sub directory  **db**
 in your user folder.
For e.g say ` 
 
 **/Users/johnny/data**

 
 After mongo db is up. Open another terminal in new window and type 
 
 it will open mongo shell with your mongo db connection opened in another terminal. 
 
 
 If you're on Mac and looking for a easier way to start/stop your mongo-db server, then  MongoDB Preference Pane  is something that you should look into. With it, you start/stop your mongo-db instance via UI. Hope it helps! 
 
 additionally you may want mongo to run on another port, then paste this command on terminal,  
 
 where  **27018**
 is the port we want mongo to run on 
 **assumptions**

 
 mongod exists in your bin i.e   for mac ( which would be if you installed with brew), otherwise you'd need to navigate to the path where mongo is installed 
 the folder   exists 
 
 
 Mac Installation: 
 
 Install brew  
 
 Update and verify you are good with  
 
 Install mongodb with  
 
 Create folder for mongo data files:  
 
 Set permissions  
 
 Open another terminal window & run and keep running a mongo server/daemon 
 
 Return to previous terminal and run a mongodb shell to access data 
 
 
 To quit each of these later: 
 
 The Shell:  
 
 The Server  
 
 
 
 Make sure you are logged in as root user in your terminal. 
 Steps to start mongodb server in your mac 
 
 Open Terminal 
 Run the command  
 Enter your administrator password 
 run the command  
 MongoDb Server starts 
 
 Hope it helps you.
Thanks 
 
 Nothing less likely to be outdated that the official docs:  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
