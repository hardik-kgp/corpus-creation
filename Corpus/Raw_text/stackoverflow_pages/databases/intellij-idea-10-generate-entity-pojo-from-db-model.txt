*** intellij-idea-10-generate-entity-pojo-from-db-model ***

 How can I generate entity (POJO) from database model using IntelliJ IDEA 10. I create "Data source" in IntelliJ but I have not any idea how can I generate the POJO. 
 
 **UPDATE:**

In IntelliJ 16 this feature in now implemented.
The steps to do it are: 
1.  **Database**
 view context menu  
2. Scripted Extensions 
3. Generate POJOs 
 
 You can read more here: 
 Feature request: allow "generate classes from database schema" for plain-JDBC developers 
 
 First you need tell intelliJ that you are using Hibernate (I guess you are if you need the orm pojo of the table) 
 
 Go to "Project structure"
( alt + ctrl + shift + s ) 
 In "Project settings" select "Modules" 
 Press  +  and add the Hibernate facet in your module. 
 
 Now you have setup your hibernate configuration facet you can extract your pojos. 
 
 At your bottom right horizontal panel you will now see a tab called 
"Persistence" (Î¹f you can't find Persistence tab you may show it by choosing View > Tool Windows > Persistence) 
 There you can right click on the hibernate icon named like your module 
 Go to "Generate Persistence Mapping"-"by database schema" 
 Now I guess you can find your way... 
 In general settings select the datasource that you want to use and now you 
can see all the tables in your datasource object 
 Now you can do many things, add relationships with the + sign, change the
name and type of the pojo's properties etc.
note: if you get an error and the "OK" is disabled its probably because the data
type that intelliJ found for your pojo is invalid. Just change it to the one
you need and you are ready to go! 
 
 
 The default  Scripted Extensions    is not very good when dealing with tables with underscore(which is very common). 
 So I make some modifications.
