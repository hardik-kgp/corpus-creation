*** intellij-idea-data-sources-doesnt-see-existing-table-in-the-database ***

 intellij idea data sources doesn't see existing table in my mysql database, while Netbeans see it.
i've created a table in the database. When i create connection in intellij idea data sources, it sees my scheme, i do select it in "schemas and tables" but then i don't see it in the list.
every schema, but mine's. When i try to connect to it with netbeans or mysql workbench, it's just ok. same story with several databases, with root access, too. any table, but mine's.
what could be wrong? 
 i see question like mine's  here , related to visual studio, no answer. 
please, give a good clue 
 
 I had the same problem in IntelliJ IDEA 15. 
 I fixed it by right clicking the data source -> Properties -> Schemas -> Use legacy introspector. 
 
 I found the reason of problem for HSQLDB: There is  **IDEA bug**
 (i have 11.0 version).  
 Create db with relative path (relative of MODULE), like this: 
 
 When added it to Data Sources, IDEA recognizes this path as  **relative of $IDEA_HOME$/bin**
 folder. 
 
 So you have two different data bases. And when JPA updated first, Data Source doesn't see update in other. 
 **WORKAROUND**
:
use absolute path in file db url.
