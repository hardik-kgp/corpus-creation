*** invalid-column-name-sql-error ***

 I am trying to enter data into my database, but it is giving me the following error: 
 
 Invalid column name 
 
 Here's my code  
 
 
 Always try to use parametrized sql query to keep safe from malicious occurrence, so you could rearrange you code as below: 
 Also make sure that your table has column name matches to  ,   , . 
 
 
 You probably need quotes around those string fields, but,  **you should be using parameterized queries!**

 
 Incidentally, your original query could have been fixed like this (note the single quotes): 
 
 **but this would have made it vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks**
 since a user could type in  
 
 into one of your textboxes.  Or, more mundanely, poor Daniel O'Reilly would break your query every time. 
 
 Change this line: 
 
 to this: 
 
 Your insert command is expecting text, and you need single quotes (') between the actual value so SQL can understand it as text. 
 **EDIT**
: For those of you who aren't happy with this answer, I would like to point out that there is an issue with this code in regards to SQL Injection. When I answered this question I only considered the question in point which was the missing single-quote on his code and I pointed out how to fix it. A much better answer has been posted by Adam (and I voted for it), where he explains the issues with injection and shows a way to prevent. Now relax and be happy guys. 
 
 You problem is that your string are unquoted. Which mean that they are interpreted by your database engine as a column name. 
 You need to create parameters in order to pass your value to the query. 
 
 
 You should never write code that concatenates SQL and parameters as string - this opens up your code to  SQL injection  which is a really serious security problem. 
 Use bind params - for a nice howto see  here ...

 You have to use  
 Instead of  
 Notice the extra single quotes. 
 
 first create database name "School"
than create table "students" with following columns
1. id
2. name
3. address 
 now open visual studio and create connection: 
 namespace school
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        SqlConnection scon;


        public Form1()
        {

            InitializeComponent();

            scon = new SqlConnection("Data Source = ABC-PC; trusted_connection = yes; Database = school; connection timeout = 30");
        }

//create command

SqlCommand scom = new SqlCommand("insert into students (id,name,address) values(@id,@name,@address)", scon);

//pass parameters

scom.Parameters.Add("id", SqlDbType.Int);
scom.Parameters["id"].Value = textBox1.Text;

           scom.Parameters.Add("name", SqlDbType.VarChar);
            scom.Parameters["name"].Value = this.textBox2.Text;

            scom.Parameters.Add("address", SqlDbType.VarChar);
            scom.Parameters["address"].Value = this.textBox6.Text;


            scon.Open();
            scom.ExecuteNonQuery();
            scon.Close();
            reset();

        }

 Your issue seems to be the Name keyword. Rather use FullName or firstName and lastName, always try and remember to use CamelCase too.
