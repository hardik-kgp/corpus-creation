*** ios-receive-data-from-bluetooth-and-then-send-information-to-a-database-on-anoth ***

 Which libraries should I look into for the following tasks?  
 
 I want to receive a string from another device via Bluetooth (this will require looking at a list of nearby devices and choosing the right one.  
 I then want to send the String to a database via Wi-fi 
 
 This is a simple version of what I actually want to do, but I need to know how to do those things first. Also, any design tips would be greatly appreciated (like having multiple screens, which classes to write, etc).  
 
 The ordinary iOS Bluetooth APIs are only available if you enter into Apple's "Made for iPod" program. See  MFi Program 
 If your device can use the newer "low energy" Bluetooth LE, you can look in the  corebluetooth framework 
 There is an example of a Bluetooth LE heart rate monitor program  here . 
 For WiFi, you can use any of several APIs from Apple and others: Berkeley unix sockets, NSURLConnection, CFNetwork, AsyncSocket, etc.  
 
 If you mean receive a string from another iOS device, the statement here about needing to be a part of the "Made For iPod" program is incorrect. This would be required if you mean you are trying to build an accessory for iPhone, iPad, or iPod.  
 The easiest way to "discover" other iOS devices (running your app) and transfer data between them is   from the GameKit Framework. Beam It! is pretty good example code for this. 
 Once you initialize a   just set a   and set the session's   property to  . Check out the four required GKSessionDelegate methods and the Beam It! sample code.

 Your best bet is to study Apple's  WiTap  sample app.  That will answer your question #1.  For question 2, you can use Apple's coredata.  If you are not familiar with coredata, check out this  site 's tutorials.
