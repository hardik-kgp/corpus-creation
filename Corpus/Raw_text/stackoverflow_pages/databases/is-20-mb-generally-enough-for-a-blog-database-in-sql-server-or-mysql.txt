*** is-20-mb-generally-enough-for-a-blog-database-in-sql-server-or-mysql ***

 I want to deploy my blog on  AppHarbor . But the free size of the database is 20 MB. I am not yet ready to pay $10/month for the 10GB database. My question is: would this be sufficient for a simple blog with one post a week?  
 I am not going to use any blogging engine. I will write my own engine with just posts in the database. I plan to use  Disqus  for comments. 
 
 That's basic math, really. 
 One post a week of say 10kB per post, would make you last 200 weeks.  Mutatis mutandis: 
 
 
 It should be enough. Consider that our blog (wordpress based) has almost 1000 posts and around 1000 comments. And the database is less than 5 MB. 
 
 yes, 20MB of data is a  **lot**
 of data (if it's text based). 
 
 If you're just using text, no images or media, that should be fine. It takes a lot of text to reach 20MB... 
 Roughly it gives you 4,194,304 words to play with (given 1 byte per character, average of 5 characters per word) 
 
 for images u can use something like photobucket, where only links are to be pasted....
20 MB is a HUGE quantity! I would reckon u start with 1 MB from a weekly basis and then go on to 20 MB, will save a bit of $$
