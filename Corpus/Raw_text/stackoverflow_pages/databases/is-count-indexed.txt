*** is-count-indexed ***

 I want to know just for curiosity that, does   also traverses all the rows of the database as that of  ? 
 Or is there any other count field available in database's metadata that updates itself each time a row is added or deleted? And that field is accessed by the former query. 
 Also I want to know that which of the both queries is faster and how much? 
 
 
 will always count all rows. Though (unlike  ) it does not have to read all columns and can use the narrowest (non filtered) index available to do so. 
 Unlike MySQL (MyISAM engine) it does not retrieve the value from metadata.  
 A rowcount value is available in the metadata and can be retrieved from   but this is never used for   queries and isn't always accurate.
