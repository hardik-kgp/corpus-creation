*** is-dbcontext-the-same-as-datacontext ***

 I'm following a tutorial by  Scott Gu  that refers to a class named DbContext. I can't find it on any namespace on framework 4 and it seems to me it was renamed from CT4 DbContext to .net4 System.Data.Linq.DataContext. Is my assumption correct? 
 
  is a new class that was added in the recent separate download by EF team. It is currently not part of the core EF 4.0. However   moving forward would be the preferred way to interact with EF. 
 So how is it different from  ? Well semantically they are exactly same but they reduced lot of extra noise that   had. Like exposing a set required more work, for instance: 
 
 With   you can do: 
 
 Basically on the  , when you do dot ( ), everything is just right there which makes the list pretty huge. What the EF team actually wanted to expose on   are entities which are only specific to your domain and rest of ability of the framework is tucked in under different properties. It just makes the programming experience easier. 
 This means if you are using   right now, with a little bit of code, you can easily move to  . 
 
 It's a bit too late, but for the googlers.   is used for   ( EntityFramework ) and   is used for   ( LINQ To SQL ).
