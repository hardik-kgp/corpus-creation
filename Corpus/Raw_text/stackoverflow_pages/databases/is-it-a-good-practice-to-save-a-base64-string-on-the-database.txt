*** is-it-a-good-practice-to-save-a-base64-string-on-the-database ***

 i'm developing an android application when the user can send a image to my webservice. 
 Currently on my WebService i get a Base64 string and save it in a table on my database. 
 **My question:**
 Is that a good practice? Because as far as i know the Base64 string is a heavy string. My concern is about the db performance, like when this table gets bigger than 10000...100000 records. Or should i avoid this behavior?
 Eg.: Isntead off store the Base64 string on the database, i could recover the image and save only the URL at my db. 
 Ps: The database is SqlServer
 
Thanks for the help guys 
 
 To answer your question, I think it's not good practice. 
 It depends largely upon how you will use these images you will probably load. Then, remember ( **base64 encoding makes file sizes roughly 33% larger than their original binary representations**
).
The best way would be writing the image and then saving its location in the database. 
 Check out  this post  as it maybe help. 
 
 i think using base64 encoding is very useful for saving URLs in the database. The big size for transmitted image is not good idea and not necessary.
