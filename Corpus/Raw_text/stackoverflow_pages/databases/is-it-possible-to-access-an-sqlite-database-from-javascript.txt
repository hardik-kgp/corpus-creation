*** is-it-possible-to-access-an-sqlite-database-from-javascript ***

 I have a set of HTML files and a SQLite database, which I would like to access from the browser, using the file:// scheme. Is it possible to access the database and create queries (and tables) using JavaScript? 
 
 Actually the answer is yes. Here is an example how you can do this:  http://html5doctor.com/introducing-web-sql-databases/ 
 The bad thing is that it's with very limited support by the browsers. 
 More information here  HTML5 IndexedDB, Web SQL Database and browser wars 
 PS: As @Christoph said  Web SQL is no longer in active maintenance and the Web Applications Working Group does not intend to maintain it further  so look here  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB . 
 
 **EDIT**

 As @clentfort said, you can access SQLite database with client-side JavaScript by using SQL.js. 
 
 You could use  **SQL.js**
 which is the SQLlite lib compiled to JavaScript and store the database in the local storage introduced in HTML5. 
 
 Up to date answer 
 My fork of sql.js has now be merged into  the original version, on kriken's repo . 
 The  good documentation  is also available on the original repo.  
 Original answer (outdated) 
 You should use the  newer version of  **sql.js**
. It is a port of sqlite 3.8, has a  good documentation  and is actively maintained (by me). It supports prepared statements, and BLOB data type. 
 
 One of the most interesting features in   is the ability to store data locally and to allow the application to run offline. There are three different APIs that deal with these features and choosing one depends on what exactly you want to do with the data you're planning to store locally: 
 
 Web storage: For basic local storage with key/value pairs 
 Offline storage: Uses a manifest to cache entire files for offline
use 
 Web database: For relational database storage

 What about using something like PouchDB?  http://pouchdb.com/ 
 
 IMHO, the best way is to call Python using POST via AJAX and do everything you need to do with the DB within Python, then return the result to the javascript. json and sqlite support in Python is awesome and it's 100% built-in within even slightly recent versions of Python, so there is no "install this, install that" pain. In Python: 
 
 ...that's all you need. It's part of every Python distribution. 
 @Sedrick Jefferson asked for examples, so (somewhat tardily) I have written up a  stand-alone back-and-forth between Javascript and Python here.
