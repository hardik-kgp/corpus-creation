 Usually I run a script like this:  
 
 The result is that the field in the table gets converted to nvarchar. But what is the syntax for doing the same thing for a view? Or is that even possible? 
 
 Sure 
 
 So check out CAST and also CONVERT on the msdn pages for full info 
 
 Yes..You can try Convert function to do this. 
 
 eg. 
where User_email has previous type as nvarchar(MAX). 
 If you want to convert nvarchar data to datetime then additional parameter is needed to Convert function like 
 
 eg.
