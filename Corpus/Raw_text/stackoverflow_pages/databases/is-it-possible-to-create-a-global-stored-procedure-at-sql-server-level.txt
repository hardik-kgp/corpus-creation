*** is-it-possible-to-create-a-global-stored-procedure-at-sql-server-level ***

 I created a query that takes a database backup at certain specified location.
I want to use it as a stored procedure but this should act as a global stored procedure so that whenever this SP is called. Then database backup is taken. 
 It uses DB_Name() to take database backup of owner database. 
 Is it possible to create any such SP or Function. 
 I am using sql server 2005 
 
 **first solution:**
  
 If you create your sp in the master database and mark it as a system object and prefix it with 'sp_' then a single copy will exist that will be shared by all databases. 
 and  **second solution**
 from msdn: 
 Private and global temporary stored procedures, analogous to temporary tables, can be created with the # and ## prefixes added to the procedure name. # denotes a local temporary stored procedure; ## denotes a global temporary stored procedure. These procedures do not exist after SQL Server is shut down. 
 an example : 
 
 
 Three steps must be followed to create a "system" stored procedure that is accessible to all databases on the Server, as well as be able to run under the context of the current database when it is called. 
 
 **Master Database**
 - The stored procedure should be created in the Master database 
 **Prefix Stored Procedure**
 - The stored procedure name should be prefixed with  **sp_**

 **Mark SP as System Object**
 - Call  **sp_ms_marksystemobject**
 to mark custom SP as a system object 
 
 Example Code Below 
 
 
 There are 3 requirement for such stored procedure 
 
 The stored procedure must be created in the master database. 
 The name of the stored procedure must start with “sp_“. 
 The stored procedure must be marked as a system object. 
 
 -- 1. Create the procedure in the master database 
 
 -- 2. Create the procedure with the prefix sp_ 
 
 -- 3. Mark the stored procedure as a system object
