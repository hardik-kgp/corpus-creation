*** is-it-possible-to-get-a-history-of-queries-made-in-postgres ***

 Is it possible to get a history of queries made in postgres? and is it be possible to get the time it took for each query? I'm currently trying to identify slow queries in the application I'm working on. 
 I'm using Postgres 8.3.5 
 
 There's no history in the database itself, if you're using psql you can use "\s" to see your command history there. 
 You can get future queries or other types of operations into the log files by setting  log_statement  in the postgresql.conf file.  What you probably want instead is  log_min_duration_statement , which if you set it to 0 will log all queries and their durations in the logs.  That can be helpful once your apps goes live, if you set that to a higher value you'll only see the long running queries which can be helpful for optimization (you can run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on the queries you find there to figure out why they're slow). 
 Another handy thing to know in this area is that if you run psql and tell it "\timing", it will show how long every statement after that takes.  So if you have a sql file that looks like this: 
 
 You can run it with the right flags and see each statement interleaved with how long it took.  Here's how and what the result looks like: 
 
 This is handy because you don't need to be database superuser to use it, unlike changing the config file, and it's easier to use if you're developing new code and want to test it out. 
 
 If you want to identify slow queries, than  **the**
 method is to use  log_min_duration_statement  setting (in postgresql.conf or set per-database with ALTER DATABASE SET). 
 When you logged the data, you can then use grep or some specialized tools - like  pgFouine  or my own  analyzer  - which lacks proper docs, but despite this - runs quite well. 
 
 pgBadger is another option - also listed here:  https://github.com/dhamaniasad/awesome-postgres#utilities 
 Requires some additional setup in advance to capture the necessary data in the postgres logs though, see the official website. 
 
 FYI for those using the  **UI**
  Navicat : 
 You MUST set your preferences to utilize a file as to   to store the history. 
 If this is blank your Navicat will be blank.
