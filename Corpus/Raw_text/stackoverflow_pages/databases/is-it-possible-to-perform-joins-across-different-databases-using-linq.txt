 Is it possible to perform joins across different databases using LINQ? If yes then how? 
 
 If the databases are on the same server, you can create views (and 3 part naming) so that all the tables are queryable from one database. 
 If the databases are on different servers, you can use linked servers and views (and 4 part naming) so that all the tables are queryable from one database. 
 
 calling .ToList() is querying all the records in db, so it will eat a lot of memory if there are a lot of records in tables. 
 Or try this one  The specified LINQ expression contains references to queries that are associated with different contexts .
