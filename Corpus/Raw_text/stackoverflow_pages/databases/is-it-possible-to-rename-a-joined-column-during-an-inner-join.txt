*** is-it-possible-to-rename-a-joined-column-during-an-inner-join ***

 Say I have two tables,   and  . Both have column  , but I'd like to join them, so there is a problem since both tables have column  . Can I rename (alias) the   column in the dog table during the query? 
 
 
 
 Yes, you can, but then you must list out all of the fields instead of using  : 
 
 
 Yes, you can rename the columns in the output of a join, that is called an alias. However, the fact that they are the same does not cause any problem; they just need to be fully qualified. 
 
 You Can Give any Alias name to the column but there is some rules like the alias name must not the key word of the SQL Server, it must not contain space, if you want space then it should be in [] you can not use some symbols for alias. 
 Ex :-
Select owner.Id As [Int], Owner. ,dog. 
From Owner inner join Gog On Owner.Id = Dog.Id
