*** is-it-possible-with-upload-a-file-and-submit-text-in-a-single-form ***

 I'm writing a plugin for wordpress where certain information like a name and e-mailaddress and some info is stored in an SQL database table. I've got that working perfectly. But this information also needs a picture to go with it.  
 So when wordpress admin fills in the form, has the file selected and clicks submit I want the file to be uploaded into a directory and its location stored in a database along with the name and e-mailaddress. 
 All this preferably needs to be done in just one form. 
 Is this possible? Or is there another way that would make the end user click only once on a sumbit button. 
 
 Yes, it's possible. Just make sure you set the form   and that you use   for file input and regular inputs ( , etc) for texts. 
 You'll need to write a code to move uploaded files to a location you want, as well as to add its info to the database. 
 See these two nice tutorials:  here  and  here . 
 
 Yes, it should be possible. 
 Just ensure that your   has the attributes   and  
 By PHP side after submit, you can use   variables as usual, plus   for handling uploads with   in the same form. 
 See  this PHP manual page  for details on file upload.
