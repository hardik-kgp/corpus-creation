 Are there any drawbacks to such a configuration? 
 
 These two databases are totally separate entities and you should have no problems running both of them on the same machine. 
 Short story: I wanted to test  Hibernate  with various database dialects, so I ended up installing these databases on one machine: 
 
 MS SQL server 
 MySQL 
 PostgreSQL 
 Oracle 
 DB2 
 
 and I had no problems with all of them running at once. Yes, it was a test server and the poor thing was totally running out of memory, but everything did work. 
 Only imaginable problem you could run into: configuring the same port for multiple databases. But you wouldn't do that, so it's not a problem. 
 
 Aside from the resources they would both consume (memory, disk, cpu); barring any purposeful conflicting configuration (by default they will listen on different ports), it would work fine. 
 
 No as far as I know.. I use both MS SQL and MySQL for my websites in the same box and no issues so far (2 years now!) 
 
 I have never run into an issue; they really don't step on each others' configurations at all.
