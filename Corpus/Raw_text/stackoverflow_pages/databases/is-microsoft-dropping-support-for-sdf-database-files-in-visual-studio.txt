*** is-microsoft-dropping-support-for-sdf-database-files-in-visual-studio ***

 In Visual Studio 2013 there is no longer an option to create   SQL Server Compact databases in WebPages (WebMatrix) websites. I am no longer able to view   database files in Visual Studio either. I downloaded the latest version of WebMatrix to open my   database but WebMatrix crashes when I open my website. When I create a new empty site and add existing files, it crashes. 
 I searched for days for a way to view and edit my   database and nothing is working. I can no longer get Navicat SQL Server app to open a database. I cannot get LinqPad to open an   database file, I cannot get Compact Viewer to open or edit   databases. I  **can**
  open    databases with   but it only shows top 200 rows  **and**
 it won't let me edit the tables. 
 Now I'm completely stumped. How do I view  **and**
 edit a   database file? 
 
 The answer is yes: Microsoft is silently dropping support (as usual IMHO) to Sql Compact Edition. 
 It started abandoning Sql CE 3.5 in Vs2012
It continued dropping Sql CE in Sql Management Studio 2012
and finally in VS2013 
 You can use  CompactView  or install SQL  Server Compact Toolbox  extension in VS2013 or (my prefered solution) use  Sql management Studio 2008 
 UPDATE thanks to  Nicolas' comment 
 As  stated by Microsoft : 
 
 SQL Server compact edition is in deprecation mode with no new releases
  planned near future. Last release SQL CE 4.0SP1 (and earlier releases
  that are still in the support cycle) will continue to be supported
  through its lifecycle and Microsoft is committed to fix any major,
  production blocking issues found in these releases.
