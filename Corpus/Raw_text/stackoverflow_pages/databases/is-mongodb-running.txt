*** is-mongodb-running ***

 I have installed mongodb and the php drivers on my unix server. 
 My question is how can I tell if mongodb is running? Is there a simple command line query to check status? If I start it once from the shell will it keep running if I exit the shell (this doesn't seem to be the case). How can I make the mongodb connection persistent and auto start on server reboot? 
 I can run: 
 
 -bash-3.2$ su

  [root@xxx]# cd /var/lib 
  [root@xxx]# ./mongodb-linux-i686-1.6.5/bin/mongod 
  ./mongodb-linux-i686-1.6.5/bin/mongod --help for help and startup options

 If I open a seperate shell I can then then connect to mongodb: 
 
 -bash-3.2$ cd /var/lib 
  -bash-3.2$ ./mongodb-linux-i686-1.6.5/bin/mongo 
  MongoDB shell version: 1.6.5 
  connecting to: test 
  db.foo.find() 
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d63d7d3eb95985ab19c8feb"), "a" : 1 } 
 
 However if I close the initial shell I can't connect: 
 
 -bash-3.2$ cd /var/lib 
  -bash-3.2$ ./mongodb-linux-i686-1.6.5/bin/mongo 
  MongoDB shell version: 1.6.5 
  connecting to: test 
  Wed Feb 23 08:25:10 Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1 (anon):1154 
  exception: connect failed   
 
 
 check with either: 
 
 or  
 
 or  
 
 to see if mongod is running (you need to be root to do this, or prefix everything with  ). Please note that the 'grep' command will always also show up as a separate process. 
 check the log file /var/log/mongo/mongo.log  to see if there are any problems reported 
 
 I find: 
 
 To be a lot more consistent. The value returned can be used to detect how many instances of mongod there are running 
 
 For quickly checking if mongodb is running, this quick nc trick will let you know. 
 
 The above command assumes that you are running it on the default port on localhost.  
 For auto-starting it, you might want to look at  this thread . 
 
 Correct, closing the shell will stop MongoDB. Try using the   command line arg for the mongod process which makes it run as a daemon instead. I'm no Unix guru, but I'm sure there must be a way to then get it to auto start when the machine boots up. 
 e.g. 
 
 Check out the full documentation on  Starting and Stopping Mongo . 
 
 this should work fine... 
 
 pgrep mongod 
 
 
 To check current running status of mongodb use:  
 
 Probably because I didn't shut down my dev server properly or a similar reason.
To fix it, remove the lock and start the server with:
 
 
 I know this is for php, but I got here looking for a solution for node. Using mongoskin: 
 
 With other drivers, you can attempt to make a connection and if it fails, you know the mongo server's down. Mongoskin needs to actually make some call (like ping) because it connects lazily. For php, you can use the try-to-connect method. Make a script!
