 Looking at the prices for RDS instances, the multi-AZ instances cost double. Having a production environment in mind, does it worth it? 
 What uptime should I expect from a single-AZ instance, as opposed to a multi-AZ one? Has anyone had experience running a production DB on both single and multi availability zones?  
 
 We have a multi-AZ production deployment with AWS RDS and its been working fabulously well since the last 3 years. 
 The  multi-AZ catalog page  clearly lists out the benefit of using a multi-az vs single RDS deployment. One of the most important aspects of running multi-az is the fact that if one of the AZ in a region goes down , the production application traffic is automatically routed to the RDS in the alternate AZ. Also, DB maintenance and upgrades are applied to the RDS per AZ basis (for a multi-AZ RDS)  without impacting uptime. 
 With respect to cost, it is totally upto the nature of the application as to how much is the degree of downtime tolerance that it can sustain. Its a cost vs uptime trade-off.
