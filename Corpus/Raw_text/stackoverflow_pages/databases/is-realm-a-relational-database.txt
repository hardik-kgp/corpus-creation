 I have tried searching about Realm but following questions were not answered. Please help me to understand the following questions properly:  
Is realm a relational database?  
How is it more efficient as compared to SQLite? 
 
 NO, Realm is  **not**
 a relational database. 
 It allows you to declare  relationships  between objects the same as you would do in any object graph in your language of choice. 
 JP's talk on the core  describes it in more detail and is highly recommended. 
 It stores objects in an optimal memory-mapped format, using  column-store  techniques for fast searching. Accessors in the different language SDKs map directly to functions using that memory-mapped storage.  
 In contrast, anything using a relational database like SQLite has multiple layers of copying buffers. 
 Note: I was on the Realm Xamarin team (2015-2017), left a great bunch of people after we shipped v1.0 to focus on my own startup. 
 
 Yes, realm is a  **relational database**
. Much faster when complex queries are fired. Supports less number of programming languages.
