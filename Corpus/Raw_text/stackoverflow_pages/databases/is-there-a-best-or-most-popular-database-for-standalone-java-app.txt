 Is there a "best" or more popular database for standalone Java app?
I'm currently writing by hand, but I would like to know what is commonly done, if there is something that is commonly done. 
 update: talking about small app (may grow, but its small for now) 
 
 I would suggest using something like  SQLite  with  SQLiteJDBC . 
 It also sounds like  HyperSQL  and  Derby  (which ships with certain Java versions) are popular choices. 
 
 Java 6 ships with Derby (renamed  JavaDB ).  It can be used in memory or server mode. 
 HyperSQL (HSQLDB)  is also popular. 
 
 For development purposes, I often use the Hypersonic SQL Database ( HSQLDB ). It's fast and lightweight, and good enough to get started.
For a bigger application, I'd go for  Derby , which supports more options. 
 
 The main competitors - HyperSQL (HSQLDB), JavaDB (Derby) and SQLite (not java-based) were mentioned. 
 There are a few other options: 
 
 db4o  - object database 
 FirebirdSQL  - not java-based. 
 Jackrabit  - a content repository (not RDBMS) supporting embedded mode. 
 
 
 
 HSQLDB  is a well-established option.  
 JavaDB  comes with the development kit 
 
 
 apart all those mentioned here, one can also go for H2 database which is light and can be used in-memory or in server mode.
