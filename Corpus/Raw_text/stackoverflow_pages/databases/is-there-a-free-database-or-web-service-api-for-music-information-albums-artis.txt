 I need to look up artist/album/track information for song titles. 
 Is there a free database I could download or a open source web service/api I could use? 
 
 Try the last.fm api at  http://www.last.fm/api . 
 If that doesn't work for you, you can look at the various APIs listed in this search result:

 This is a Silverlight tutorial, but since this is an HTTP REST API, it could seem agnostic to you to get started:  http://www.devx.com/VisualStudio/Article/40158 . 
 
 I'd go with musicbrainz.

 I would personnally recommend  Discogs , which is free and doesn't limit the  per day  usage. However, it limits the amount of requests to one per second per IP address. 
 The  API  is quite clear and documented. It uses JSON over HTTP, and has wrappers for various programming environnements (Python, Ruby, Perl, .NET, PHP). 
 Plus, it has data about a massive amount of artists, releases and labels. 
 
 Yes!  The Echo Nest . Pretty hot startup outside Boston that just got more funding. Their API lets you search by artist, album, track, and more. 
 
 FreeDB is free, but may or may not have an API. It is user-generated content.

 And apparently  Gracenote  is the new CDDB (but probably not free). I guess they finally figured out that they didn't want to limit their database to CDs.
