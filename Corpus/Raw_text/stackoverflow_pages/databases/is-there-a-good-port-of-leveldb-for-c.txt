 I wish to use leveldb in my pure C# project. 
 I have googled for a C# version of leveldb, but got no lucky. 
 Any one can tell me where I can find a C# version of leveldb? 
 Thanks 
 
 Not that I know of, but I've been using it in my C# project. If you're familiar with C++, then you can make your own CLI wrapper (shouldn't be that much trouble), build it as a DLL and then you can load that DLL in your C# project like any other assembly reference.  
 There is a  windows port for leveldb  and it's a little tricky to get it into Visual Studio, but if you're having trouble I can upload my Visual Studio 2010 solution (which is 75% of the battle) with the whole thing set-up and ready to build (except the CLI wrapper). I can put it up on github or something, which I'm actually planning on doing anyway, but I'll expedite it for you. 
 Like I said, I've been using that approach for my C# project and it works great. However, if you have really high performance requirements, then I would recommend batching up "work" in order to reduce the  P/Invokes . 
 **Example**

 Please note that I have not compiled this code, but I'm just posting it as an example.  Your header file might look like this: 
 
 Your cpp file is going to be along the lines of: 
 
 This should get you in the right direction. 
 **Get Example**

 OK, Get will look like this: 
 
 The source is along the lines: 
 
 Note that different data may have different encoding, so I feel like the safest way to pass data between your unmanaged and managed code is to use pointers and an  . Here is how you would get the data associated with a key in C#: 
 
 Again,  I have not compiled or run the code , but it should get you on the right track. 
 
 As much as I can see you could also use LMDB 
(lightning memory mapped database,  http://symas.com/mdb/  ) 
which seems quite similar to LevelDB and also comes with a .Net wrapper
( https://github.com/ilyalukyanov/Lightning.NET ) Dont know how well it works though, haven't used it yet... 
 
 I haven't used it, but I see  leveldb-sharp . 
 
 I don't know the story here, but there's this project at Microsoft's official Rx-Js page  here .
