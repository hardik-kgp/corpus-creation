 Maximum size for a SQL Server Query? IN clause? Is there a Better Approach   
 
 I Googled for a while and can't find whether there's some hard limit on how huge query strings can be in SQL Server. I mean what if I build a 100 million character query - will it run or will the server just drop it as too long? 
 Is there a limit to how long SQL query can be (in terms of characters or tokens or whatever like that) in SQL Server? 
 
 I never encountered a problem of SQL query being too long in terms of number of characters, but there is a  **maximum number of tables**
 a query can reference (256) and I hit this limitation a few times. 
 Have you ever encountered a query that SQL Server could not execute because it referenced too many tables?
