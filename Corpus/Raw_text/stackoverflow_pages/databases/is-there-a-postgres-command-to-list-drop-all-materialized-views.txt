*** is-there-a-postgres-command-to-list-drop-all-materialized-views ***

 I am creating multiple views in my code and each time the code is run, I would like to drop all the materialized views generated thus far. Is there any command that will list all the materialized views for Postgres or drop all of them? 
 
 Show all: 
 
 Names are automatically double-quoted and schema-qualified where needed according to your current   in the cast from   to  . 
 In the system catalog   materialized views are tagged with  . 
 The manual: 
 
 
 
 To  **drop**
 all, you can generate the needed SQL script with this query: 
 
 Returns:  
 
 One   statement can take care of multiple materialized views. You may need to add   at the end if you have nested views. 
 Inspect the resulting DDL script to be sure before executing it. Are you sure you want to drop  **all**
 MVs from all schemas in the db? And do you have the required privileges to do so? (Currently there are no materialized views in a fresh standard installation.) 
 
 While using the standard interactive terminal  , you can use the meta-command: 
 
 Executes this query on the server: 
 
 Which can be reduced to: 
 
 
 This would be easier if you want to get a full list with the DROP statement in front of each view: 
 
 
 This an answer is based on the answer from  Erwin Brandstetter . The version below adds a specific schema name to only retrieve the materialized views from a defined schema. The Cascasde also drops dependencies on the materialized views from that schema. Be careful with that.
