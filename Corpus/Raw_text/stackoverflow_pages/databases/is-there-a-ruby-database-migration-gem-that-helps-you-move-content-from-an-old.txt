 Are there any Ruby gems/libraries that help you migrate from an old DB structure to a new structure? ActiveRecord migrations do a good job keeping track of a new db structure, but I wonder if there's something that helps you migrate an entire legacy db to a new structure: 
 
 (I realize you could do these transforms just as easily with AR, but I'm  hoping  the magic library would have many more transforms.

 I've begun working on this. 
 If anyone would like to give tips on a better/more idiomatic, or more efficient implementation, please let me know.

 **edit**
:  
 I now have this exact syntax working on the above github repository... plan to add a few rake tasks for mapping the old structure to new ActiveRecord classes, and more transforms...in case anyone's interested. 
 It's also on gemcutter/rubygems: gem install legacy_migrations 
 
 You can access all your models from within a migration, and thus handle all your data migrations right there too. If you already knew this, and your question was about a neater way of doing it, then of course this is not the answer you're looking for. 
 One problem with your example is that you can't migrate down to an earlier version, but only because of the block feature you demonstrate in conversions. 
 I admit that your example is nice and terse, but here's a regular migration example any way: 
 
 
 I've had to do something like (what I think) you're describing, and I used  Sequel  for it.  Sequel is adaptable and generally useful and can work with SQL directly in a fairly handy fashion and can access multiple different sorts of DBs. 
 The documentation is very handy, and I recommend it entirely. 
 Here's an example  of using sequel to take a huge arbitrarily flatfile from  geonames  and use it to fill out a db and make queries.   This is probably a good example for you to make something to do what you want. 
 It's rails-agnostic.  doesn't need to be attached to a model, migration, or anything else other than a couple gems. 
 
 There are quite a few for moving databases without transforms. I remember the Rails Envy guys talking about a gem (but it's a while back and I haven't got time to go digging). Have a look on railsenvy.com? 
 
 Have a look at the  Trucker Gem  it works great for migrating legacy data into a Rails application. It creates active record objects for each table in the legacy database and puts them in app/models/legacy. Inside these classes you can then define how they map onto your new classes. 
 
 
 config your database in config/database.yml 
 
 convert schema.rb into db/migrate/001_create_database.rb 
 you can generate other migration to maintain your database schema
