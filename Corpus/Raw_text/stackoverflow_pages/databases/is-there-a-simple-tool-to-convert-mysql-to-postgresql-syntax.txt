*** is-there-a-simple-tool-to-convert-mysql-to-postgresql-syntax ***

 I've tried the tools listed  here , some with more success than others, but none gave me valid postgres syntax I could use (tinyint errors etc.) 
 
 There's a   option which makes it output PostgreSQL code: 
 
mysqldump --compatible=postgresql ...
 
 
 After some time on Google I found  this post . 
 
 Install the  mysql2psql  gem using  . 
 Create a config file by running  . You'll see an error but a   file should have been created. 
 Edit

 There is one piece of pay software listed on this postgresql page:

 This page  lists the syntax differences, but a simple working query converter i haven't found yet. Using an  ORM  package instead of raw SQL could prevent these issues. 
 I'm currently hacking up a converter for a legacy codebase: 
 
 For   statements,  SQLines  converts most of them online. I still had to edit the mysqldump afterwards, though:  
 
 
 Try this one , it works like charm !! 
 
 
 Have a look at  PG Foundry , extra utilities for Postgres tend to live there. I believe that the tool you're looking for does exist though. 
 
 you will most likely never get a tool for such task which would do all of your job for you. be prepared to do some refactoring work yourself.
