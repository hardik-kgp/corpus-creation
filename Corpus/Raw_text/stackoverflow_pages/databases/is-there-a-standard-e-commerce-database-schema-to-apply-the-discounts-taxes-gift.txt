 A good and flexible database schema illustrating e-commerce products and their rates management is required. 
 
 I agree with Chris Roberts,  OSCommerce  is a good place to start as well as  DatabaseAnswers.org . 
 Hope that helps. 
 
 I'm sure there are many examples about - try looking at some open source shopping cart tools. 
 As a general point, though, I think there are so many ways that a product pricing and discount / gift voucher system  could  work that finding a database schema that works for  every  possibility is unlikely! 
 Perhaps you can save yourself some heartache by refining the requirements a little?
