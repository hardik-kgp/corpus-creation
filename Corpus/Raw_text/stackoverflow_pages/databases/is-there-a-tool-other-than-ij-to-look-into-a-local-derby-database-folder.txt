 I'm using Derby ij to look into my local Apache Derby database. It's just a folder and I connect to it like this: 
 
 It works, but I don't really like to look into the database in the console. Is there another tool for this? The best would be something with a GUI. 
 
 Squirrel SQL  can connect to an Apache Derby database.
 Getting Started using the SQuirreL SQL Client 
 
 I simply use NetBeans IDE (Services -> Databases) to connect to my local or remote derby databases. 
 You can also create new derby databases there. 
 
 I use DBeaver Community Edition (free and open source). 
 When comparing DBeaver CE 6.0.2 (2019-04-08) against SQuirreL 3.9.1 (2019-02-24) I noticed that SQuirreL does not show some database objects (eg. sequences). 
 DBeaver supports intellisense / auto-completion, updating table rows in-place (ie. "select for update"), and can globally apply filters on schemas and catalogs in connection settings (eg. exclude SYS schemas from the object tree display). It can also run pre- and post-connection scripts (handy for initialising an ij session with preferences eg. protocols).
