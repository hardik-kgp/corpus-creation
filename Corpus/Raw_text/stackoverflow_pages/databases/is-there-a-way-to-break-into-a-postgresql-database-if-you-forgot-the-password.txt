*** is-there-a-way-to-break-into-a-postgresql-database-if-you-forgot-the-password ***

 I have a client that has a PostgreSQL database and he cannot remember the password that we used when the database was setup. Is there a way to recover that information so I do not have to blow away his database and start from scratch? 
 The database is running on a PC. 
 
 **Step 1:**
 Edit PostgreSQL config file to establish trust relationship to login without password: 
 
 vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf 
 
 Old Line: 
 
 local all postgres password 
 
 Change it to: 
 
 local all postgres trust 
 
 **Step 2:**
 Restart PostgreSQL Server: 
 
 service postgresql restart 
 
 **Step 3:**
 Change password: 
 
 psql -U postgres template1 -c alter user postgres with password ‘newpassword’; 
 
 **Step 4:**
 Password has been updated. Revert back the original settings of config file: 
 
 vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf 
 
 Old Line: 
 
 local all postgres trust 
 
 Change it to: 
 
 local all postgres password 
 
 **Step 5:**
 Restart server and use your new password to access PostgreSQL Server. 
 
 service postgresql restart 
 
 Source 
 
 For 9.2, in windows: 
 Stop the service: 
 
 Net stop postgresql-x64-9 
 
 Modify the config file, 
change data/pg_hba.conf, basically md5 to trust: 
 
 host   all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust 
 host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust 
 
 Start the service: 
 
 Net start postgresql-x64-9       
 
 Execute the sql statement to set your desired password, on a sql console or using psql: 
 
 alter user postgres with password ‘newpassword’; 
 
 Put back the original config file.
