*** is-there-a-way-to-create-multiple-triggers-in-one-script ***

 I am trying to create multiple triggers with only uploading one script into an Oracle DB / APEX workspace, and running it once. 
 Here is a brief script compared to the one im trying to use: 
 
 I have tried putting GO in between each individual block, but still only creates the first trigger then gives me an error for the second saying:  
 
 I am hoping that it is possible to do this. Thank you very much for your time and interest =) 
 
 Add a forward slash on a new line after each trigger to execute the command in the buffer: 
 
 
 Put a slash '/' as the first character on a blank line between each trigger statement. This is the SQL*PLUS equivalent of 'go'. 
 
 Place a forward slash 
 
 between the two statements on a separate line. 
 Oracle will then accept it as a new statement 
 
 Yes we can execute multiple procedure/trigger/function in single script using the FORWARD SLASH /  inside the sql file.  
 Like below: 
 
 Then oracle will consider it as new statement/block. 
 
 
 How to execute it:
