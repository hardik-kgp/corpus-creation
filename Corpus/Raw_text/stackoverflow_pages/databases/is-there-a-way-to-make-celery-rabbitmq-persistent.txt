*** is-there-a-way-to-make-celery-rabbitmq-persistent ***

 So that if my server crashes, I still have my Tasks? 
 
 RabbitMQ can be persistent, and Celery sends persistent messages by default, so you don't have to do anything to enable this. 
 
 rabbitmq persist those messages by default 
 rabbitmq wont delete messages if they are not acknowledged by consumers,so that's how celery does. 
 when worker crashed and restarted again,they will receive the messages that not acknowledged last time before crashed.
