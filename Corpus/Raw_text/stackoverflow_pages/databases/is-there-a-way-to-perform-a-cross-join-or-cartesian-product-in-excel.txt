 At the moment, I cannot use a typical database so am using excel temporarily.  Any ideas? 
 The  
 
 You have 3 dimensions here: dim1 (ABC), dim2 (123), dim3 (XYZ). 
 Here is how you make a cartesian product of 2 dimensions using standard Excel and no VBA: 
 1) Plot dim1 vertically and dim2 horizontally. Concatenate dimension members on the intersections: 
 
 2) Unpivoting data. Launch pivot table wizard using ALT-D-P (don't hold ALT, press it once). Pick "Multiple consolidation ranges" --> create a single page.. --> Select all cells (including headers!) and add it to the list, press next. 
 
 3) Plot the resulting  **values**
 vertically and disassemble the concatenated strings 
 
 Voila, you've got the cross join. If you need another dimension added, repeat this algorithm again.

 Using VBA, you can.  Here is a small example:   
 
 
 Here is a very easy way to generate the Cartesian product of an arbitrary number of lists using Pivot tables:

 The example is for two lists, but it works for any number of tables and/or columns. 
 Before creating the Pivot table, you need to  convert your value lists to tables .
