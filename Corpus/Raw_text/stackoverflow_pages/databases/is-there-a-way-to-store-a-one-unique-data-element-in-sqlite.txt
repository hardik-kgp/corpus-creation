*** is-there-a-way-to-store-a-one-unique-data-element-in-sqlite ***

 I need to use SQLite database file as a file for storing information, and I want to store the version of the file in the SQLite database file.  
 How can I do this? I mean, how to store unique (only one) data in SQLite? I don't want to use store the info by making table for this, as the version info is just one number. 
 
 For SQLite, which  is  an  embedded database , after all, there's nothing wrong with using a single table for holding a unique value like this. 
 
 It's an embedded database.  You expect  good  performance when you use it, not  perfect  performance.  A single extra table (holding only a single row ever) shouldn't make  any  difference to any reasonable application.
