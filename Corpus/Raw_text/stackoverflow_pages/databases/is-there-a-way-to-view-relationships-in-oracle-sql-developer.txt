 I want to find which tables are related to a specific table. I can see all the foreign key constraints easily enough, but what about table for which the table I am looking at is the primary key table and the other table is the referenced table. 
 
 It's not clear if you're looking for a GUI solution, but you can query the information from the dictionary by: 
 
 
 Steps in SQL Developer 
 
 go to   >   >   to open up the   view/tab.   
 (  view/tab*) right click on   and select   which opens up a new window.   
 
 This should create a new blank diagram which one can drag and drop tables from the   view into the diagram.
