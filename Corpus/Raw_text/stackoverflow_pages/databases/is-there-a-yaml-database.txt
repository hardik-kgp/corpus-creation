*** is-there-a-yaml-database ***

 I like YAML's data model a lot, preserving most of the simplicity of JSON and extending it with a few sometimes-important features like custom data types and references. 
 So is there any way to store a lot of data in the YAML data model (or something very similar) and query it using an index? Like a YAML database, analogous to  XML databases  or JSON databases like Mongo DB. Or is there a mapper from YAML to something like Mongo DB that lets me transparently use it as a YAML store? 
 I haven't found anything so maybe there aren't any. Why would that be? Is it a stupid idea or is YAML simply too young and they will come?

 Not directly as far as I know. 
 The main problem seems to be that Mongo DB's interface is based on a hash (i.e. key-value pairs). So in essence you are asking if there is a mapper from YAML to a hash. The answer is no simply because YAML can store arbitrary structures while hashes cannot.  
 But if you're willing to simplify your objects, you might be able to partially do this: 
 
 If you look at the to_yaml code you'll see that it's very similar to the to_hash method (because that's where I got the idea).  
 Note you'll probably need a from_hash method as well. And you probably want to start working out a scheme for classes with instance variables that are objects (i.e. not just Strings, Symbols, etc.) 
 Now the mongo code to insert the item: 
 
 I realize this doesn't answer your question directly, but hopefully it still helps.

  is rather used for config purposes. It is not used for database such as MongoDB because serialization takes longer than  . In fact, json is not a subset of yaml (although it's close).   libraries are generally faster :  stackoverflow.com/questions/2451732/ â€¦.  
 
 If interoperability and speed are a concern, use JSON. -
