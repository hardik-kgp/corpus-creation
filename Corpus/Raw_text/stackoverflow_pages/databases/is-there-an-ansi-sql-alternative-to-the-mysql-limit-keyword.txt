 Is there an ANSI SQL alternative to the MYSQL LIMIT keyword? 
 The LIMIT keyword limits the number of rows returned by a SELECT e.g: 
 
 returns 2 rows. 
 
 returns 2 rows after the first 10. 
 
 this shows the different ways: 
 
 
 Not in SQL:1999. 
 There are two possible approaches you can use in later standards, with generally low levels of support in today's DBMSs. 
 In SQL:2008 you can use the DB/2 syntax: 
 
 This only works for “LIMIT n” and not the extended “LIMIT m, n” offset syntax. In SQL:2003 you can use window functions, which can support the extended syntax but is a super PITA: 
 
 You will more usually use the DBMS-specific methods today.

 I don't believe so.  All the databases that I'm aware of use vendor-specific keywords for that functionality. 
 
 Adding to @jle's  answer :  
 
 SQLite supports   (MySQL/PostgreSQL)  
 InterBase/Firebird support   and   (like Informix)

 HSQL/H2 uses LIMIT like MySQL 
 
 Let me link here a related SO question, with a  great answer by Lukas Eder  and another  good answer by bobince : 
 How universal is the LIMIT statement in SQL? 
 edit:  A few more good reference links, worth to look at in similar cases: 
 
 Wikipedia on limiting results and   in the   statement  ; 
 "Comparison of Different SQL Implementations" on limiting the result sets  ; 
 The jOOQ user manual page on the   clause  from  Lukas Eder's answer .
