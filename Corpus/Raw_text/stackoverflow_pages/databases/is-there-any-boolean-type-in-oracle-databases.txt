 Is there any Boolean type in Oracle databases, similar to the   datatype in Ms SQL Server? 
 
 Not only is the boolean datatype missing in Oracle's SQL (not PL/SQL), but they also have no clear recommendation about what to use instead. See  this thread  on asktom. From recommending   they switch to   when someone points out that   depends on the English language, while e.g. German programmers might use   instead. 
 The worst thing is that they defend this stupid decision just like they defend the   stupidity. 
 
 Nope. 
 Can use: 
 
 --- enjoy Oracle 
 Or use char Y/N  as described here 
 
 As per Ammoq and kupa's answers, We use number(1) with default of 0 and don't allow nulls. 
 here's an  add column  to demonstrate: 
 
 Hope this helps someone.  
 
 Not at the SQL level and that's a pity
There is one in PLSQL though 
 
 No, there isn't a boolean type in Oracle Database, but you can do this way: 
 You can put a check constraint on a column. 
 If your table hasn't a check column, you can add it: 
 
 When you add a register, by default this column get 1. 
 Here you put a check that limit the column value, just only put 1 or 0 
 
 
 No there doesn't exist type boolean,but instead of this you can you 1/0(type number),or 'Y'/'N'(type char),or 'true'/'false' (type varchar2). 
 
 There is a  boolean type for use in pl/sql , but none that can be used as the data type of a column. 
 
 A common space-saving trick is storing  **boolean**
 values as an Oracle  **CHAR**
, rather than NUMBER: 
 
 Just because nobody mentioned it yet: using RAW(1) also seems common practice.
