 Is there any option for local database like Sqlite for j2me - CLDC devices? 
PerstLite and OpenBaseMovil are both under dual license.
Is there any open source option for this?
Or, any alternate way of developing application. 
 
 from  List of Database in J2ME : 
 Apache Derby  - an open source relational database / about 2 megabytes 
 Java DB  - Sun's supported distribution of Apache Derby database / footprint of 2.5 MB 
 Floggy  - free object persistence framework for J2ME/MIDP applications / 11k API 
 J2MEMicroDB  - free object persistence framework for J2ME 
 mDrawer  - J2ME generic database program with DES encryption 
 RMS DB Class  - J2ME class to provide easy access to the RMS-Database system of mobile phones 
 Micro DB  -  implementation of relation database in J2ME plataform     
 For small amount of data you also may use  kXML  +  miniXPath 
 
 I think Floggy is promising. It's frequently updated and it has good documentation. Released under Apache license.
