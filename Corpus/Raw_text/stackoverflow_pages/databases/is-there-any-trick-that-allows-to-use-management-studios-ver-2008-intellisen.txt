 New version of Management Studio (i.e. the one that ships with SQL Server 2008) finally has a Transact-SQL IntelliSense feature. However, out-of-the-box it only works with SQL Server 2008 instances. 
 Is there some workaround for this? 
 
 There's no known trick 'in the wild' for getting around this, other than using CTP-6 of SQL Server 2008 (in favour of the RTM). 
 the reasons for removing backward compatability (and a lot more discussion besides) are provided at the  relevant feedback in microsoft connect . 
 edit: sorry i don't know where this ctp is available, if at all 
 
 Has anyone tried either patching SSMS not to check the version (perhaps try looking at the binary differences between CTP 6 and RTM?), or patching SS 2005 to pretend to be 2008? 
 Unclean, I know, but I don't see any other way.
