 I found a lot. But which one is the best? And why? I didn't find yet anything really complete and centralized in one good article or documentation. At least a good book? Thanks. 
 
 Our (Riptano's) Cassandra documentation is probably the best one-stop resource:  http://www.riptano.com/docs 
 A good complement from the ASF wiki is  http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArticlesAndPresentations . 
 
 The  Cassandra High Performance Cookbook  is the most recent book. It has a how-to format but along the way documents many of the features.
