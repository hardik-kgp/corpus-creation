*** is-there-any-way-to-create-mongodb-like-id-strings-without-mongodb ***

 I really like the format of the _ids generated by mongodb. Mostly because I can pull data like the date out of them client side. I'm planning to use another database but still want that type of _id for my document. How can I create these ids without using mongodb? 
 Thanks! 
 
 Object IDs are usually generated by the client, so any MongoDB driver would have code to generate them. 
 If you're looking for JavaScript, here's some code from the MongoDB Node.js driver: 
 https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/blob/1.0-branch/lib/bson/objectid.js 
 And another, simpler solution:

 A very easy pseudo ObjectId generator in javascript: 
 
 
 I have a browser client that generates  s. I wanted to make sure that I employ the same   algorithm in the client as the one used in the server. MongoDB has  js-bson  which can be used to accomplish that. 
 If you are using javascript with node. 
 
 **Using require statement**

 
 **Using ES6 import statement**

 
 The library also lets you import using good old script tags but I have not tried this.

 I just tried upgrading the package to bson 4.0 and the package threw an error. 
 
 Extending Rubin Stolk's and ChrisV's answer in a more readable syntax (KISS). 
 
 
 ruben-stolk's answer is great, but deliberately opaque? Very slightly easier to pick apart is: 
 
 (actually in slightly fewer characters). Kudos though! 
 
 There is a detailed specification here 
 http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Object+IDs 
 Which you can use to roll your own id strings
