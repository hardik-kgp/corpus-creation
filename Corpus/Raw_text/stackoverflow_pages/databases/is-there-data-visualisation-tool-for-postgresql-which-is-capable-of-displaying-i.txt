 Operating system used is linux. I have tried  Navicat  and  SQL Power Architect . They did display relations between tables in the same schema. I have some foreign key constraints which reference tables in a different schema.  
 
 Am I missing something with respect to Navicat and PostgreSQL Maestro? Can they not display the inter schema relations? 
 Is there data visualisation tool for postgresql which is capable of displaying inter schema relations as well? 
 
 **UPD**
  Sorry for editing your question, but I found it useful. Because this is closed I can not answer (maybe there should be site for that??) 
 For drawing table relationship of your database you can try  this script  of  GraphViz::DBI  perl module. 
 As result you will get the  GIF  with relations 
 
 I've recently discovered  DBeaver . It automatically detects relations between tables in a visual manner. You can move tables around, change colors, see foreign keys, etc. It's extremely good. Fully compatible with PostgreSQL 
 Querying and manipulating data using the GUI is extremely easy. 
 Not only that you can use it with all major SQL and noSQL databases, so all your data can be managed in just one place. 
 
 DbVisualiser seems to do what you're after:  http://www.dbvis.com/doc/main/doc/ug/databaseSpecific/postgresql.html 
 There's also a list of alternate tools here (though it's not as query-able a list as you'd expect from a DB):
