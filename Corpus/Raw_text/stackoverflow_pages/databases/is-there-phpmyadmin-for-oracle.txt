 I mean a php online script that connects to Oracle?  Or should I use navicat?  Is navicat that good?  Any other alternative?  I secretly hope that I will not be forced to use command line interface for a product that costs $40k (Well I am using the Express Edition. But anyway). 
 
 Check out Oracle SQL Developer.  It's free, and it is a fully featured IDE.   Find out more.   
 
 I use  PLSQL Developer . It's not online, but it beats command line interfaces. :) 
 
 As others have posted, I use SQL Developer for my IDE. However, if you are looking for a fully functional web interface like PHPMyAdmin, check out Oracle's  Application Express (Apex) . 
 It's free, and although it's meant as a rapid web development tool, it has great tools to manage your schema, tables, and other objects. 
 
 In addition to SQL Developer and PL/SQL Developer, you could use TOAD (Tool for Oracle Application Developers). It has both a paid for version and a free version.  
 In my experience the free version is easy to use and powerful enough for most users.
