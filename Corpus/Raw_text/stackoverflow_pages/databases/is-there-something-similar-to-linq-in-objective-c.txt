 I wonder if it is possible (and how) to provide a class in Objective-C with something like: 
 
 That could be very handy for a project I'm doing. 
 I like this way of coding present in Django & SubSonic. 
 
 The short answer is that there is not an equivalent to Linq for Objective-C but you can fake it with a mix of SQLite, NSPredicate and CoreData calls in a wrapper class shaped to your liking.  You'd probably be interested in the  core data guide , the  predicate guide , and  this example code . 
 From the above predicate guide: 
 
 
 I created my own Linq-style API for Objective C, which is  available on github . Your specific example would look something like this: 
 
 
 There is an acticle comparing the Windows and Cocoa ways of doing this. Cocoa uses Key Paths And NSPredicate....

 I think specific to your example this would be the equivalent in Cocoa: 
 
 It's a little more verbose than the LINQ example and some of my lines could have been combined but to my eye this is easier to parse. 
 
 My project,  **LINQ4Obj-C**
, ports LINQ standard query operators to Objective-C.  
 You can find it on  github  and its  docs here . This library is also available through  CococaPods .  
 Source code of this project is available under the standard MIT license. 
 Your example would look this: 
 
 **NB**
 I removed second condition (ID != 2) as it is pointless. 
 At the moment the library provides extension methods (categories) for collection classes, but in future I will also extend its functionality to   to provide direct query access to Core Data. 
 
 Check out the following repository:  https://github.com/ziminji/objective-c-sql-query-builder 
 These classes provides a set of convenience methods that can be used to build well-formed SQL queries quickly for Sqlite.  They are quite simple to use and are relatively straight forward since they follow basic SQL syntax.
