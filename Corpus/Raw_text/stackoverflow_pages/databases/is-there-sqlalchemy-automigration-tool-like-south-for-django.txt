 Is there SQLAlchemy automigration tool like South for Django? 
 I looked to  sqlalchemy-migrate  but it doesn't seem to generate sql update scripts automatically or upgrade downgrade DB 
 Looks like with sqlalchemy-migrate you need to 
a) manually copy your old model to a new file
b) crate new model in application and copy it to a new file
c) write manually create/drop/alter tables in python sqlalchemy extended dialect 
d) generate sql alter script
e) run command to execute alter sql script 
 As for me it doesn't solve the problem and only adds overhead, as I can simply do d) manually and it will be much faster then do a), b), c) manually just to d) that you can do in one step. 
 Is there any auto migration libraries for SQLAlchemy like South for Django, or many RoR-like migration tools? 
 What I need is to change SQLAlchemy model in python app, run tool and it will compare current DB schema to new DB schema that new model should use, and create Alter scripts that I can adjust manually and execute.  
 Is there any solution like this in Python? 
 
 You can perform automatic migrations with  Alembic . I use it in two large-scale projects I am currently working on. The automatic migration generator can recognize: 
 
 Table additions and removals 
 Column additions and removals 
 Change of nullable status on columns 
 Basic changes in indexes, explicitly-named unique constraints, and foreign keys 
 
 (see also:  https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html ) 
 **Install alembic**

 
 or (depending on the version of Python you are using): 
 
 **Configure alembic**

 Execute the following command in your project: 
 
 This will set up alembic for your project, in a folder called  . 
 You will then need to edit the generated   configuration file. 
 In the file  , tell Alembic where to find SQLAlchemy's   object in your project.

 **Generate the migration**

 Simply execute the following command line: 
 
 Or even (not recommended): 
 
 **Upgrade the database**

 After this, I upgrade the database with this simple command from the folder containing the    configuration file:

 There is  Alembic  which looks very promising, but the problem is (for now) that the support for SQlite databases is very limited. 
 
 No there is none at this moment. Alembic require you to write code regarding adding/deleting/altering table structure or creating/dropping table. So nothing like django south exists for sqlalchemy. 
 
 Have you looked into using  ?
