 Hello I'm trying to make an error when there is no matched student...
and it will display like this
  and I want the column name still the same but still not figuring it out... can some one tell me if this is right?? 
 Heres my function for that... and I add comment there where I put the error... but i don't know how to get the columnname 
 
 I try like this but still gave me NULL!!! 
this code is below of  
 
 
 
 
 Try this. 
 
 Since here your expecting is to get the columns alias instead of column name, so you have to use ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel instead of ResultSetmetaData.getColumnName. 
 
 Get   using  : 
 
 And then to get column name of 1st column: 
 
 Similarly to get column name of 2nd column: 
 
 
 Get the metadata 
 
 Then you can do: 
 
 
 ResultSetMetaData doc 
 
 
 
 and do not concat the query param!
