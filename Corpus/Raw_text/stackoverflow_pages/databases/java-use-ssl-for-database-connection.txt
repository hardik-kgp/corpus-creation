*** java-use-ssl-for-database-connection ***

 I am currently making a connection to my database without using SSL.  I now would like to utilize SSL.  The way I have it set up, is my database source is in config. 
 
 I can get the SSL connection to work by calling my program with the following arguments 
 
 I can also get it to work by changing the env variables in the code itself 
 
 However, my goal is to make the SSL connection without making any changes to my code and without having to change the VM arguments I use.  Is there a way I can set my source to include this information? 
 Something like: 
 
 I tried this exactly and it doesn't work, ideally I could just add the info to the config I already have so that I don't have to make changes in more than one place.  Any ideas? 
 
 **Suggestion 1:**
 put your trust store instead of the java's trust store, or import your certificate into the java's trust store:  
 **Suggestion 2:**
 Write your own driver extending  . Put the SSL configuration into the new code. Although you need to code, but not in the main application. Not sure if it's acceptable for you. 
 
 According to the security section of the  MySQLConnector documentation , the   takes as input an URL.  
 That is, you have to prefix it with   in order to make it work for local files. In other words, you need to set the path to your truststore as  .  
 The same goes for  , if you're using that parameter too.
