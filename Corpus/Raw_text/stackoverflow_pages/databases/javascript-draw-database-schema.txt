*** javascript-draw-database-schema ***

 I have the need to display a couple of database tables' structure (4-5 tops) in a HTML page. I have to show the columns, mark the primary key and also draw the foreign keys connections (arrows I guess).  
 I have chosen raphael.js and it's all fine except for the foreign keys arrows, because they have to avoid intersection with tables and do it in a fancy way e.g. turning around corners and stuff.  
 Does anybody know of a solution to that? If not, how can I easily draw the arrows? 
 What I have for now as a try-out is  http://jsfiddle.net/eKF6R/ 
 And it's fine for connecting the tables but I need to connect the specific columns and also to avoid intersection.

Hope it help you. 
 
 You can check the following doc reference from RaphaÃ«l:
 http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html#Paper.path 
 You can use 'L' as parameter to draw lines instead curves: 
 
 Maybe it's been 2 years from your question, but many people could have the same question (as I was). 
 Best Regards.
