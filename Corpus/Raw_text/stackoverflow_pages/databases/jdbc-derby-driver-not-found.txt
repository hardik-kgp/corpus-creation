*** jdbc-derby-driver-not-found ***

 I've followed the JDBC tutorial at:  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/gettingstarted.html , and managed to build and create my own JDBC database without too much fuss. However now when trying to connect to the database from a java application I'm receiving the exception: 
 
 java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:derby: db
  directory 
 
 Then when trying to manually specify the JDBC driver using: 
 
 I get the following exception error: 
 
 java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver 
 
 I am positive that that driver should have no issues loading as that is the driver specified in the tutorial and it had no issues creating the database using that driver. I've event tried adding the property " ;create=true" at the end of the connection statement to try and create a brand new database but I still receive the same exception error. 
 Please see my application code below.
Any help at all would be fantastic :). 
 
 
 
 java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:derby:db
  directory 
 
 So your error can be caused by: 
 Driver is not loaded correctly or your   is malformed. So at first you need to ensure that your   is in classpath. Check it out. 
 Also try to change your   to: 
 
  will ensure that db will be created if does not exist. 
 **Update:**

 Look at this thead also:  SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:derby://localhost:1527 
 
 If you have this type of error 
 
 and you are using   then you have to follow these steps: 
 
 right click on library 
 choose add library option and from the list of libraries choose  **"Java DB Driver"**

 
 
 
 Java JDK comes with both 
 
 Within eclipse add the following jars to the used JRE(JDK) or explicitly to your project. 
 
 For runtine you needed to made the appropriates jar available for your java application. 
 
 You said you have followed the tutorial. In the tutorial you had to install JDBC driver. 
 
 Installing a JDBC driver generally consists of copying the driver to
  your computer, then adding the location of it to your class path. 
 
 After installing the driver you run 
 
 That is only possible if you messed the correct diver. 
 You have used  
 
 to load the driver 
 but should use 
 
 
 See the "Set DERBY_INSTALL" and "Configure Embedded Derby" section at  https://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/install_software.html#derby_configure  for details.   
 Derby is part of the JavaSE installation and I had setup environment variable   instead of   shown in the link.   
 
 
 I have been putting any needed jdbc driver at for example in the jre\lib\ext directory.
On my system that would be: X:\Java\jre1.8.0_181\lib\ext
Hope that helps. 
 
 I was getting the  **java.lang.ClassNotFoundException**
 upon using the  **ClientDriver**
.
I used the latest Driver binaries, and that was the mistake. 
 At that time, the latest Driver binary was 10.15.1.3, right here:  Apache Site 
 I'm on Java 8, and I use the Hibernate 5.4.2.Final.
Yet, the driver is compiled against the Java 9!
