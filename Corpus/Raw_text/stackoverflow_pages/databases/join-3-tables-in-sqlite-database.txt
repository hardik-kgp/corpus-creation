*** join-3-tables-in-sqlite-database ***

 I have 3 tables in SQLite database: 
 **Songs:**

 
 **Artists:**

 
 **Albums:**

 
 I need a query (use it in an Android app) of a table that consists of the following columns: 
 
 However, I write the following query statement: 
 
 but it gives me an empty table. I tried   instead of   and it gives incorrect results (every song duplicates in each album, though the artist is correct). How can I fix my query statement to join the 3 tables in a single table? 
 
 Using an explicit   instead of an implicit one, the following should get what you want, although it is curious that your implicit join syntax did not return correct results in the first place.  I have used a  , to account for songs which do not have an associated artist or album, but that may not be necessary for your data set and an   could be used instead. 
 I have also added column aliases to eliminate ambiguity when fetching rows, since you have similar column names in most of your tables ( ). 
 
 
 Try this select, may by the   is more important than others, so the   come trough   and   from  . 
 
 Also if there is no entry in   belonging to a particular artist or no entry in   belonging to a particular song, you will still get the artist entry thanks to the  . If you would like to return only artists with songs and albums, use   instead.
