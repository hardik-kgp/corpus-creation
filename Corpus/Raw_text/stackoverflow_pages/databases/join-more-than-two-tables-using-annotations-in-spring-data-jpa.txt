*** join-more-than-two-tables-using-annotations-in-spring-data-jpa ***

 I've three entities:  ,   and  , and the relation between them is as following:  
 
 But from my current entity classes, I can make relation between any 2 tables using  . But what I want is to save relation between all 3 entities in a separate table, having primary keys of these entities as columns. (Foreign keys) 
 If we assume entities   and   are already saved (inserted) into database and I insert new entity of   as following:  
 
 Then   should be saved in it's table and the relations should be listed in a separate table as following:  
 
 One of the related question I've seen  here . But I think my scenario is different as I've many to many relations between all the entities  ,   and  .  
 I'm not asking for full code. Any approach or exact reference will be fine as long as it solves the purpose. Thanks 
 **EDIT:**

 I've tried implementing the separate relation table as mentioned in the answer. But the problem with this approach is that, when I remove a row from the relation table, It also removes the entry from the join table of   and  . (Affects the previous relation of entities   and  ) 
 Also while updating updating the row, it changes (performs insert) into the join table of entity   and  . Which is not expected behavior. I want this table for just storing the relation between the entities and not for changing previous relations between those entities.  
 Following is my new relation table:  
 
 
 If you want to keep the   in separate table then you can simply do something like this to save

 When I remove a row from the relation table, It also removes the entry >from the join table of   and  . (Affects the previous relation of >entities   and  ) 
 
 The above solution should not   the entries in a   table unless explicitly defined. However you may be using other mappings in your other classes so this behavior can be controlled by applying  Cascading  in your mappings.

 And what about using your new class RelationEntity with A nullable. When you intent to remove the "new" relationship you update it putting null in A property. It's just a suggestion, forgive if you cannot make it this way.
