*** join-multiple-columns-from-one-table-to-single-column-from-another-table ***

 I'm trying to learn how to join multiple columns from one table to a single column from another table. 
 **This is my table structure in its simplest form:**

 teams 
 
 trades 
 
 **This is my current SQL which joins trades.team_1 to teams.id:**

 
 **My question is, how do I create a second join that also joins trades.team_2 to trades.id?**

 This would mean both trades.team_1 AND trades.team_2 would be joined to trades.id 
 **The results I want to get back would be:**
