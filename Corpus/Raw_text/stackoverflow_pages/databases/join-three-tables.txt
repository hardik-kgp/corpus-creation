*** join-three-tables ***

 I am trying to retrieve two sets of information (the red and blue portions of the diagram in the one query. 
 I thought I could do it using the sql as stated below but it does not return me anything when TableC has no records. If TableC has no records, I would still want this query to return me the results as indicated by the BLUE area. 
 
 SELECT A.* FROM TableA A 
 JOIN TableB B ON (A.id = B.a_id) 
 JOIN TableC C ON (A.id = C.a_id) 
 
 Appreciate any pointers to return me the red and/or blue segments. Thanks in advance  =] 
 
 try something like this 
 
 
 To understand why you don't get any results when   has no records, you need to learn a bit about JOIN types in SQL. 
 Basically, when you issue the query 
 
 you're telling the database to look at both   and   and fetch all pairs of rows which satisfy the join predicate (A.id = B.a_id). Therefore, if   is empty, the database can't find and  pair  of rows with the prementioned criteria. 
 This type of JOIN is called  **INNER JOIN**
 and it is the most common type of join operation used. 
 In your case you want to fetch  all  rows from   and all  relevant  rows from  , if such rows exist (based on the join predictate "A.id = C.a_id". This is the case for an  **OUTER JOIN**
. The two most common types of such join are the LEFT JOIN (which includes all rows from the left table) and the RIGHT JOIN (which includes all rows from the right table). 
 In this case, your query should be: 
 
 I would suggest to have a look at the  relevant Wikipedia  page, if you want to know more about types of joins in SQL 
 **Edit**

 By following the same logic, if you want to have all rows from   and only the relevant rows from tables   and   (if they exist), your query would become:
