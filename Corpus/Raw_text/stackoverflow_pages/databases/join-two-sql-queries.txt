*** join-two-sql-queries ***

 I have two SQL queries, where the first one is: 
 
 and the second one is: 
 
 (Dont mind the '?', they represent a parameter in birt).
What i want to achieve is the following:
I want an SQL query that returns the same as the first query, but with an additional (third) column which looks exactly like "Total Amount 2008" (from the 2nd query). 
 
 Some DBMSs support the   syntax. 
 Think of your two original queries as temporary tables. You can query them like so: 
 
 
 
 
 I would just use a  Union 
 In your second query add the extra column name and add a   in all the corresponding locations in the other queries 
 Example 
 
 
 Here's what worked for me: 
 
 I used joins, not unions (I needed different columns for each query, a join puts it all in the same column) and I dropped the quotation marks (compared to what Liam was doing) because they were giving me errors. 
 Thanks! I couldn't have pulled that off without this page!
PS: Sorry I don't know how you're getting your statements formatted with colors. etc. 
 
 perhaps not the most elegant way to solve this 
 
 
 If you assume that values exist for all activities in both years then just do an inner join as follows 
 
 If you can't assume this, then look at doing an outer join 
 
 Try this: 
 
 Basically you have to JOIN Incomes2008 table with the output of your first query. 
 
 You can use CTE also like below.
