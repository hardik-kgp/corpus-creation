*** jpa-entity-has-no-primary-key ***

 I have an Entity class: 
 
 I get the following error: 
 
 I read online and found out that entities must have a primary key defined.
But my table here is a ONE row table only. It just used to save system configuration. 
 So only queries I will like to do will be to check if the row exists then get that row and update it. 
 My columns are  **serverIp, port, name of the server**
. 
 How should I proceed to remove this error? 
 
 I had this problem as well with a message without PK.  
 In Oracle, you can use the ROWID column which is always there for any table. 
 Like this: 
 
 Hope it helps... 
 
 
 
 Entity class must be annotated with the   annotation. 
 Entity class must have a no-arg constructor. 
 Entity class must not be final 
 Entity class must implement the   interfaces. 
 Entity class must have a unique, immutable  
 
 Otherwise, you cannot. 
 
 Every entity object in the database is uniquely identified.
An alternate way to represent a table without a primary key is to use a composite primary key using all its columns, or some of them representing a candidate key: 
 
 Maybe you will have problems with [Select By Id]: 
 
 Take care and be happy!!! 
 
 You can mark the applicationName or the ip address as the primary key (though not auto generated). It's ok even if neither of these columns are declared as primary keys in the database. 
 
 Another way would be specify that the class itself can be used as unique identifier with @IdClass. So in this case just annotate the class with @IdClass(CmcMapServerInfo.class) and it should be independent of underlying database.
