*** jpa-entity-specify-persistence-unit ***

 I have a JavaEE project that makes use of multiple persistence units.  Is there any way to specify which persistence unit a particular JPA Entity belongs to?  Some entities are in one data source, while others are in my second data source.  Is there a way to differentiate between the two using annotations? 
 
 To specify which persistent unit an   belongs to, use the   file: 
 
 Note the use of  . 
 
 The   should be usable as well (I haven't tried it, yet, though) 
 e.g.  
 
 From the Javadoc ( http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/PersistenceUnit.html ) 
 
 "Expresses a dependency on an EntityManagerFactory and its associated
  persistence unit." 
 unitName 
            (Optional) The name of the persistence unit as defined in the persistence.xml file. 
 
 
 Also you can identify from which persistent unit an entity belongs by identifying the EntityManager that registered it. 
 A managed entity belongs to a persistence context, and a persistent context belongs to a persistence unit. So in this example: 
 
 entity1 belongs to persistence-unit-1 and entity2 belongs to persistence-unit-2. It's not so explicit like specifying the <class> tags in persistence.xml, but you can have the same entity classes in both persistent units and still differentiate to which unit each entity instance belongs.
