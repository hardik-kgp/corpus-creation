*** jpa-hibernate-ddl-generation-char-vs-varchar ***

 I have a JPA/Hibernate data model that I am using the Hibernate hbm2ddl tool to generate database DDL. I have some strings that should be CHAR and some that may be VARCHAR in the database. I want to minimize hand editing of the DDL (I realize that some will have to happen). 
 Anyone know how I should go about this? I realize that I can make all Strings VARCHARS or CHARS via a hacked dialect, but that isn't what is always appropriate in the database. 
 I would like to be able to do this with annotations or aop, avoiding custom column definition text in my classes. 
 Thanks. 
 
 Annotate the strings you want to map to a CHAR in the database with
 . 
 
 So, I finally found that you can specify a length limit for a type in the dialect. So, I've decided that anything under a length of 10 should be char and anything over that should be varchar: 
 
 That isn't exactly what I was wanting, but that is good enough. Sad that I didn't find that earlier.
