*** keep-postgresql-fdw-foreign-schema-in-sync ***

 Using Postgres 9.6 with   extension, there any means to keep the tables present within the local schema in-sync with the tables on the remote database? I often need to add new tables to the wrapped schema on the remote database and would like to access them locally via FDW without having to drop and re-import my foreign schema or individual tables as they come / go. 
 I'm looking for a command such as  . 
 
 I don't think there is a refresh, but the drop and import should take less than a second: 
 
 
 Dropping and recreating definitely works, but I don't like it as I often have views that are dependent on my local tables (which reference the foreign schema), so dropping the schema will also remove all views. To get around this, you can reimport the foreign schema, but limit it only to the new tables you've created:
