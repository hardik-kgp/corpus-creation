*** kill-a-postgresql-session-connection ***

 How can I kill all my postgresql connections? 
 I'm trying a   but I get: 
 
 I've tried shutting down the processes I see from a   but this doesn't work either: 
 
 
 You can use  pg_terminate_backend()  to kill a connection. You have to be superuser to use this function. This works on all operating systems the same.  
 
 Before executing this query, you have to  REVOKE  the CONNECT privileges to avoid new connections: 
 
 
 If you're using Postgres 8.4-9.1 use procpid instead of pid 
 
 
 
 Maybe just restart   =>    
 
 With all infos about the running process: 
 
 
 MacOS, if  postgresql  was installed with  brew : 
 
 Source:  Kill a postgresql session/connection 
 
 OSX, Postgres 9.2 (installed with homebrew) 
 
 
If your datadir is elsewhere you can find out where it is by examining the output of  
 
 This seems to be working for PostgreSQL 9.1: 
 
 Lifted from gists found  here  and  here . 
 Here's a modified version  that works for both PostgreSQL 9.1 and 9.2. 
 
 I use the following rake task to override the Rails   method. 
 
 
 Edit: This is for Postgresql 9.2+  
 
 I had this issue and the problem was that Navicat was connected to my local Postgres db. Once I disconnected Navicat the problem disappeared. 
 EDIT: 
 Also,  as an absolute last resort  you can back up your data then run this command: 
 
 ... which will kill everything that the postgres user is accessing. Avoid doing this on a production machine but you shouldn't have a problem with a development environment. It is vital that you ensure  every    process has really terminated before attempting to restart PostgreSQL after this. 
 EDIT 2: 
 Due to  this unix.SE post  I've changed from   to  . 
 
 I'VE SOLVED THIS WAY: 
 In my  **Windows8 64**
 bit, just  ing the service:  **postgresql-x64-9.5**

 
 
 
 Just wanted to point out that Haris's Answer might not work if some other background process is using the database, in my case it was delayed jobs, I did: 
 
 And only then I was able to drop/reset the database. 
 
 Quit postgres and restart it. Simple, but works every time for me, where other cli commands sometimes don't. 
 
 Easier and more updated way is:  
 
 Use   to find the connection #  
  of the connection 
 
 Note: There may be identical PID. Killing one kills all. 
 
 There is no need to drop it. Just delete and recreate the public schema. In most cases this have exactly the same effect. 
 
 
 Remote scenario. But if you're trying to run tests in a rails app, and you get something like 
 "ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::ObjectInUse: ERROR:  database "myapp_test" is being accessed by other users
DETAIL:  There is 1 other session using the database." 
 Make sure you close pgAdmin or any other postgres GUI tools before running tests. 
 
 I'm on a mac and I use postgres via  . I solved this problem just quitting and starting again the app. 
 
 Open PGadmin see if there is any query page open, close all query page and disconnect the PostgresSQL server and Connect it again and try delete/drop option.This helped me. 
 
 In PG admin you can disconnect your server (right click on the server) & all sessions will be disconnected at restart 
 
 For me worked the following: 
 
 I am using: 
gitlab_edition: "gitlab-ce" 
gitlab_version: '12.4.0-ce.0.el7' 
 
 Case : 
Fail to execute the query : 
 
 Solution : 
a. Display query Status Activity as follow : 
 
 b. Find row where 'Query'  column has contains : 
 
 c. In the same row, get value of 'PID' Column    
 
 d. Execute these scripts :
