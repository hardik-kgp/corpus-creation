*** laravel-4-adding-where-clause-to-a-join-condition ***

 It says in the  laravel docs  that it is possible to add where clause on a join, but whenever I try in my code using the where clause, I get the error:  . Anyone knows how to add where clause in a join clause? 
 Laravel Website Example: 
 
 Code I'm trying to implement: 
 
 
 if you want add more condition on a   add more   or  . 
 if you want to add a condition to your first select, add it outside join function. 
 
 
 **Updated**

In Laravel 4.0 which I think you use, you can't use   inside your join closure, but since Laravel 4.1 and above you can have   conditions after your join condition. I couldn't find documentation for Laravel 4.1 but  **this is the #join documentation for L4.2 and above**

 You are sure that you are working with laravel 4.1? I think you are using laravel 4.0 instead of 4.1. Look in your composer.json file.
