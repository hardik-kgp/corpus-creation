 I have an existing user table with information seeded via   from UserSeeder.php. Now, I am adding new product table and want to seed information into product table. How can I prevent Laravel from seeding the UserSeeder into the database, but only the new ProductSeeder being seeded? 
 Thanks. 
 
 You can call individual seed classes by their class name.
From the  docs . 
 
 By default, the db:seed command runs the DatabaseSeeder class, which
  may be used to call other seed classes. However, you may use the
  --class option to specify a specific seeder class to run individually: 
 
 
 In the example above, the   class should exist in  . 
 
 Here's a working example with the class full namespace: 
 Should use double backslashes  . 
 Class name is  .
