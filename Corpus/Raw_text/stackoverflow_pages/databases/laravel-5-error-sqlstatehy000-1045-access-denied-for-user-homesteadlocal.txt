*** laravel-5-error-sqlstatehy000-1045-access-denied-for-user-homesteadlocal ***

 I have installed Laravel 5 successfully and changed MySQL credentials in database.php file in config directory to
    ' 
 
 I don't want to use homestead and I have changed .env file to 
 
 I don't understand that why it's saying that access denied for 'homestead'@'localhost' 
 
 It's working now. I had to restart server. 
Thanks 
 
 You need to run these two commands 
 
 
 I was facing the same issue. Everything was fine but in  
 
 bootstrap/cache/config.php 
 
 always had the incomplete password. Upon digging further, realized that the password had '#' character in it and that was getting dropped. As '#' is used to mark a line as a comment.  
 
 None of these worked for me when I deployed my website online on shared hosting, below is what I did that worked. 
 In the   file, I changed  
 
 to  
 
 and viola, it worked well as expected. 
 
 if you before use localhost and root your file be cached 
 remove /bootstap/cache/config.php 
 
 This works to me: 
 
 Thanks.  
 
 I Faced Same Problem what i did  
 
 php artisan cache:clear  
 php artisan config:cache 
 
 but Same problem found than i run this artisan command 
 php artisan view:clear 
 Hope it will helpful. 
 
 You do not need to set credentials in database.php file. It is enough if you have credentials in .env 
 If you are able to login to database directly then this password must work. It can be possible that you are having different environment than "local" which is defined in this file. Test is with "php artisan env" 
 
 Try to checkout the ".env" file in your root directory. It will be a hidden file. Correct these values. 
 
 
 Please update below file. 
 vendor - .env - on line#7 
 
 Instead of homestead user your database, username and password. This should work for you. 
 
 Pls Update .env file 
 
 
 After then restart server 
 
 
 Instead of using this 
 
 USE this 
 
 
 I came up with this too...
then I solve it by putting the database information directly in  " database.php " 
In your case, I would change the information like this 
 
 and don't forget to change your setting in XAMPP's config.inc 
 
 
 Match the .env file and the config.php file with your username and password and your hostname in the database settings.if they are not equal,relation will not connect. 
 
 If you are on MAMP 
 Check your port number as well generally it is 
 Host localhost 
 Port 8889 
 User root 
 Password root 
 Socket /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock 
 
 The .env file should have same database name , username and password as in the mysql database and check whether all permissions are granted to the user for accessing the database or not.
I solved my problem by adding the cpanel username in front of database name and username
like jumbo_admingo and jumbo_user1 respectively where jumbo is my cpanel username and admingo is the database name i created in mysql and user1 is the user which has been provided the access to the database admingo.
THIS SOLVED MY PROBLEM. 
 
 Reason is the old database credentials are cached  
 In the .env file, I modified it as follow  
 
 Then removed that file 
 
 **If the issue still there you might try the following.**

 php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache 
 Exit vagrant by writing the   command
Then restart vargarnt/homestead config  
 
 Then opened vagrant again  
 
 
 
 Edit the file .env in your laravel root directory. make looks as in below :  
 
 Also create one database in phpmyadmin named, "laravel". 
 Run below commands : 
 
 
 It worked for me, XAMPP with Apache and MySQL.
