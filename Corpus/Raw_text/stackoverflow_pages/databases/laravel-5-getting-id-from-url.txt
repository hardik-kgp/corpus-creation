*** laravel-5-getting-id-from-url ***

 I have a table view in which I can click an button icon and redirect to another page carrying the  id  of the row that has been clicked. 
 
 what I want is to get the  id  from the URL and put it in a variable so that I can utilize it my other page. 
 I'm currently stuck with this controller function. 
 
 
 This is late. But for the benefit of others like me;

, something like this 
 
 This id will be available as a parameter in your handler funtion, 
 
 
 The trick is to declare the url's structure at routes including the id, for example: 
 
 Then, just inject the id in the controller's function: 
 
 
 
 **Controller**

 
 
 Simple example:
