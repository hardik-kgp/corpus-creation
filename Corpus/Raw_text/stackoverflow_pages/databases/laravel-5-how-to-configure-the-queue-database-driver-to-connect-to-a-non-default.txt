*** laravel-5-how-to-configure-the-queue-database-driver-to-connect-to-a-non-default ***

 In Laravel 5.1, we can set the Queue connection configurations in  . 
 
 
 
 
 However, it will only use the default database connection in  . 
 If I have 2 database, 1 default database   in localhost, and 1 database   in a remote server, and the Queue   table is in the remote database  , how can I configure the Queue database driver to use the remote   database? Please note that the main App is using the default database in localhost. 
 
 You can use the   parameter in   to set the correct database connection ( from the ones you've defined in   ). 
 
 I was looking for the same thing and found it in the source code. 
 NOTE: This will not only read the jobs from this connection ( when running the queue ), but also write them to this connection ( when dispatching a new Job ) . 
 
 The best answer here did not work for me, not to say it isn't the best answer for a different issue than mine.  My issue was that Laravel did not cache my config settings. 
 After going into file \config\queue.php and changing the default driver... 
 
 The queue was still running on the sync driver. 
 I then checked the file... 
 
 Around line 30 I saw this... 
 
 ...but to connect to the database, it should be... 
 
 This resolved the issue... 
 
 Running the config:cache commmand rewrites the config.php file to the current driver settings. 
 
 You can set the   variable in the model. Note that this will only affect   queries and will not work for the Fluid Query Builder. 
 
 This would of course require you to have a 2nd   connection in your   file that is  .
