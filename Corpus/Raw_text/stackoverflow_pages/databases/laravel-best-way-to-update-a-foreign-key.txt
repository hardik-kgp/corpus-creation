*** laravel-best-way-to-update-a-foreign-key ***

 I have this migration file 
 
 and I want to update to make it  **->onDelete('cascade');**

 
 What is the best way to do this? 
 Is there something like  **->change();**

 Thanks 
 
 Drop the foreign key then add it again and run migrate.  
 
 
 Christopher K. is right, at the Laravel docs says: 
 To drop a foreign key, you may use the dropForeign method. Foreign key constraints use the same naming convention as indexes. So,  **we will concatenate the table name and the columns in the constraint then suffix the name with "_foreign"**
: 
 
 Or, you may pass an  **array**
 value which will automatically use the conventional constraint name when dropping:

 **How to do via Controller**

 1- Set a Rought: 
     Route::get('foreignkeyforimg', "foreignkey@index");
 2- Create controller With Foreignkey Name. 
 3- Foreignkey Controller with extend from Migration class. 
4- Go to database and delete old primary key manually from the table
