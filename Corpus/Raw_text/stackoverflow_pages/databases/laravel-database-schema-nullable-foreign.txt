*** laravel-database-schema-nullable-foreign ***

 I've these two database tables: 
 
 User Tables 
 Partner Tables 
 
 **User Tables**
 will handle this kind of informations 
 
 While  **Partner Tables**
 will contains all the user meta information such as first name and last name, etc. 
 
 When a user is register to the site I only want few fields which are,  ,  ,  ,   and  . These are only the required fields. 
 So information in partner tables can be filled later after the user have finish registering to the site. 
 But due to the structure of foreign key, I cannot proceed any further because of this error : 
 
 I know this is cause by the countries table which is required by the partner table. 
My question is : is there a work around so I can fill the country or any other non required data on partner table but keep the foreign table schema for countries, states, etc. 
 
 Set the   and the   nullable, like so.
