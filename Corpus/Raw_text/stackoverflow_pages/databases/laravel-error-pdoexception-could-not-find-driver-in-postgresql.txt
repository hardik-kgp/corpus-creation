*** laravel-error-pdoexception-could-not-find-driver-in-postgresql ***

 I'm trying to connect with PostgreSQL database through Laravel in order to do a php artisan migrate but doesn't seem to be directed since it's reading the database name of MySQL.  
 Here are the commands from database.php: 
 
 If I remove the MySQL paths I'll get: 
 
 
 **EDIT:**

When trying to do php artisan migrate I get a 'PDOException: could not find driver'. I'm using WAMP and I'm in Win8.1. Using PostgreSQL as database.

 
 **EDIT:**

Have experimented a series of alternative solutions but I'm still ought to get this solved.
The   file was checked in Apache, WAMP (from php folder) and PostgreSQL. The   is correct as it being ->  
 The   and   are uncommented. 
 Done the   trick in the 'System Variables' and rebooted. No chance.  
 Thanks for the help so far. 
 These are my drivers   &   from  
 Information from phpinfo: 
 
 PHP Version 5.5.12

 Be sure to configure the   key in  
 For postgres, this would be  
 If you are receiving a   error, check to see if you have the correct PHP extensions installed.  You need   and   installed and enabled.  Instructions on how to do this vary between operating systems.   
 For Windows, the   extensions should come pre-downloaded with the official PHP distribution.  Just edit your   and uncomment the lines   and  
 Also, in  , make sure   is set to the proper directory.  It should be a folder called   or   or similar inside your PHP install directory. 
 Finally, copy   from   into   and restart all services through the WampServer interface. 
 If you still get the exception, you may need to add the postgres   directory to your  : 
 
 System Properties -> Advanced tab -> Environment Variables 
 In 'System variables' group on lower half of window, scroll through and find the   entry. 
 Select it and click Edit 
 At the end of the existing entry, put the full path to your postgres bin directory.  The bin folder should be located in the root of your postgres installation directory. 
 Restart any open command prompts, or to be certain, restart your computer. 
 
 This should hopefully resolve any problems.  For more information see:

 For PHP 7 in Ubuntu you can also do: 
 
 So, now you can do not uncomment lines in  
 **UPD:**

I have a same error, so problem was not in driver.
I changed my  , but every time I saw an error.
And I change database config in   and errors gone. 
 
 This worked for me: 
 
 
 I realize this is an old question but I found it in a Google search so I'm going to go ahead and answer just in case someone else runs across this. I'm on a Mac and had the same issue, but solved it by using  HomeBrew . Once you've got it installed, you can just run this command: 
 
 And replace the 56 with whatever version of PHP you're using without the decimal point. 
 
 I had the same issue. This is what worked for me. 
 There are 2 php.ini files: 
 
 C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\bin 
 C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.5.12 
 
 NOTE: This is using my version of PHP and Apache, change to what yours are. 
 The php.ini file located in the both folders is what you need to update, the extentions: 
 
 extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll 
 extension=php_pgsql.dll 
 
 These are what you need to uncomment (remove the ; symbol). 
 Restart both Wamp and the Command Prompt. 
 Hopefully it will work for you :). 
 
 
 
 For those wanting to use Postgresql on OpenSuse (and co), try the following: 
 
 
 Old thread I know,  but I lost a couple of hours of my life with this.  You also need to set the DB info in the .env file.  You don't  have  to specify the driver here because the default specified in database.php is used (I think).  I was struggling because it had   in the .env file and I was using pgsql. 
 
 I was on shared hosting and there I had to enable all the    
 
 
 Solved after 3 hours... 
I am using WAMP (PHP 7.2.4), PostgreSQL 10, Laravel 5.6.29. 
Loaded PHP extensions (pgsql, pdo_pgsql) from Wampserver 3.3, then I was able to connect to the PostgreSQL server with a simple php testcode from the www directory. But   still returned  
 
 PDOException::("could not find driver") 
 
 I checked the shell (git bash for windows) with  , that returned C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.4\php.ini instead of c:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.33\bin\php.ini, loaded by WAMP
So you have to uncomment pgsql and pdo_pgsql extensions also in C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.4\php.ini, and then migrate will work ... 
 
 In Windows 8 PC with Laragon 3.4.0 180809, I faced the same issue. It happened in my case because I updated Laragon and it added a new version of PHP. So in   I actually had two directories: 
 
 
 
 
 I added   into my   variable. But in my Command Console, running   was showing that the path actually was fetching from the older one:  . So I deleted the old one (for safety, I put it in Recycle Bin). But Laragon failed to start after that. 
 So, in  , I changed the path to the latest PHP version. Then restarted Laragon and the issue is resolved. ðŸ˜Š

 I got this problem too. I have solved this issue already. If u are using Wamp then perform the following steps. 
 
 
 Go to   (where   is the php version you are using) 
 Edit file php and uncomment this line by removing the semicolon: 
 
 
 
 
 
 Save and restart your Wamp server 
 
 
 If it does not work, please check your   and config/database again. 
 
 sudo apt-get -y install php*-mysql ( just run this command )  
 
 I had the same error on PHP 7.3.7 docker with laravel: 
 This works for me 
 
 This will install the pgsql and pdo_pgsql drivers. 
 Now run this command to uncomment the lines extension=pdo_pgsql.so and extension=pgsql.so from php.ini 
 
 
 In my case, I had two versions of PHP installed. So all I had to do was use 
   instead of  
   
 
 This worked for me: 
 
 I am working with 32bit Ubuntu 14 
 
 I see you are using Windows. I was not able to fix this with enabling any of the extensions that come with my Windows WAMP Server. I tried PDO_ODBC and others and even found the  Microsoft Official PDO_SQLSRV .  
 The solution for me was to install the PDO_SQLSRV drivers from a 3rd party website. I found the drivers through 
 http://robsphp.blogspot.nl/2012/06/unofficial-microsoft-sql-server-driver.html   
 I usually don't use DLLs from random websites, but I was desperate and this worked for me. Hoping it might save others numerous hours of frustration. 
 
 Using Laravel V  **5.5.39**
 with Php  **7.1.12**
 is working fine, but later (newer) php versions cause the problem. So, change Php version and you will get the solution  **100%**
