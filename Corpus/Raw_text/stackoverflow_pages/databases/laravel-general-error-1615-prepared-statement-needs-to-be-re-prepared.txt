*** laravel-general-error-1615-prepared-statement-needs-to-be-re-prepared ***

 I'm using last version of laravel (5.1) in a homestead virtual machine (vagrant). 
 I connect my project to a local mariaDB server, in which I have some table and 2 db-view. 
 Since I made some select only on the db-view tables, I receive back randomly this error: 
 
 General error: 1615 Prepared statement needs to be re-prepared 
 
 From today, I always get this error when made select only on the db views.
If I open my phpMyAdmin and make the same select it return the correct result. 
 I tried to open   and select one record of the db-view but it return the same error: 
 
 How can I fix that?
I read about a problem with mysqldump (but not in my case) and to increase value of   but it is not sure that it will work and I can't modify them. 
 Is this a kind of laravel bug? 
 How can I figure that out? 
 
 Edit: 
 As asked, I add my model source code.
Source.php: 
 
 
 Edit 2: 
 If I execute the same query in the project with mysqli it works: 
 
 
 EDIT 3:
Afeter 2 month, I'm still there. Same error and no solution found.
I decide to try a little solution in aritsan tinker but no good news.
I report what I've tried: 
 First try to fetch a table model: 
 
 Now try to fetch a view table model: 
 
 When contentRepository doesn't have correct table name setup inside the model ContentRepository.php: 
 
 CHANGE TABLE VALUE INSIDE model ContentRepository.php: 
 
 When it is correct,  **pay attention to "errorInfo" that is missing**
: 
 
 Show db's tables: 
 
 Try with normal select: 
 
 Try unprepared query: 
 
 Try second time unprepared query: 
 
 Try PDOStatement::fetchAll(): 
 
 Try second PDOStatement::fetchAll(): 
 
 Try statement... : 
 
 Thank you 
 
 It seems to work adding 
 
 Inside   file in DB configuration. It will be like this: 
 
 Laravel 5.1. Hope it will help! 
 
 As per the comments in the accepted answer, 
running 
   
 in the MariaDB solved the problem.

 Seems like it's a  MySQL Bug  that has been documented.  
 **Edit:**

 Is your model using 'id' as the primary key? I like to set the primary key explicitly in the model even if it is. 
 
 You can also try commenting out the   functions and trying again. Sometimes Laravel can do weird things on eagerLoad, especially if there are A LOT of records that it is trying to map to.
