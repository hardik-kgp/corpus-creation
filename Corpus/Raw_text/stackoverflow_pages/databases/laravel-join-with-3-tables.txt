*** laravel-join-with-3-tables ***

 I am building a Twitter-like app. There is a Feed in which I want to only show posts of Users who I follow. 
 I tried everything with joins, but nothing seems to work. 
 I have 3 tables:  ,  ,  
 The Tables look like this: 
 **Users**
:  
 **Followers**
:  ,  
 **Shares**
:  
 What I need to get is "ALL Shares WHERE share.user_id = followers.follower_id"
"ANDWHERE followers.user_id = users.id" 
 Assume, the users.id is 3, I tried this: 
 
 But it doesnt work. 
 Any help is appreciated :) 
 
 I believe your join is wrong: 
 
 I also suggest you to name your table as   instead, it feels a bit more natural to say   and  . 
 **Example**

 
 **Model approach**

 I didn't realize you were using   queries and not models. So I'm fixing the answer and providing a lot more clarity. I suggest you use models, it's a lot easier for those beginning with the framework and specially SQL. 
 **Example of models:**

 
 **Example of Model usage:**

 
 
 In terms of general MySQL syntax, this is best written: 
 
 will return a data set of all followers and their respective shares. 
 I believe you would want the following in Laravel 
 
 
 Instead of  
 
 It should be 
 
 because on the original example the 'followers.follower_id' is interpreted as a string. 
 
 
 to see results. 
 
 for other query Simply give discription of your table 
 
 
 Take a look
