*** laravel-nested-relationships ***

 I'm having trouble getting a very-nested relationship to work correctly in laravel. 
 The wanted behaviour is as follows,  
 **I select an event by ID and i want to see which persons are subscribed to it.**

Now the problem is there are some tables between the event and the person.. 
 This is the query that works! 
 
 These are my relations 
 **Event Model**

 
 **City Model**

 
 **Company Model**

 
 **Person Model**

 
 What I have tried 
 
 and 
 
 And many other possibilities, I'm really stuck on this. Is it so difficult in laravel to achieve this kind of nested relationship linking? 
 Thanks! 
 
 
 If you only want to select certain fields from the   table, use this: 
 
 
 For city and companies specific fields , you need to distribute the with eloquent.
Eg:  
 
 
 I created a   relationship for cases like this:  Repository on GitHub 
 After the installation, you can use it like this: 
 
 You can get attributes from intermediate tables with  : 
 
 
 To expand on @rashmi-nalwaya 's answer. I got it working for a 5.8 project with some tweaks. 
 My example was a bit different because I am trying to reference hasOne relations, rather than hasMany. 
 So for reference, Domains belong to one Website, which belongs to one Server.  I only wanted to return certain columns from all of those tables.  I had to do this. 
 
 Had to make sure I passed through the primary key for the table I'm on at any time (so the   in my case), and secondly, the foreign key of the related table I'm trying to get to.  So   from domain, and   from website.  Then it worked perfectly. 
 In my code I also have a further where clause on the main domain, after all this with-ness.
