*** latin-1-to-utf-8-database ***

 I have a database that is uft8_general_ci, only problem is up until this point an application coded by a previous developer seems to have been working with the database in latin-1. 
 I have since changed how the app uses the database and can now store an umlaut as an umlaut instead of Ã¼.  The problem now is that the application reads the previously existing data from the database as (example) 'SÃ¼ddeutsche' instead of 'Süddeutsche'. 
 Is there anyway to convert the data inside the database from one format to the other? 
 Regards 
 Edit: 
 
 This worked for me. 
 
 You could try   to let the Database talk in   with your application while storing in   or you will need to convert all previous Datasets to  -Strings 
 
 try 
 
 and 
 
 don't forget to replace the 'ß':
