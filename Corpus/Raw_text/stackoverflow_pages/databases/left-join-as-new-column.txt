*** left-join-as-new-column ***

 Im trying to do multiple LEFT JOIN's on the same column of a table.I need to LEFT JOIN "table2.words" with "table1.color" and "table2.words" with "table1.food". How do I do this? and can I do it by making the left joined "table2.words" a new column? 
 **My SQL code:**

 
 **table1:**

 
 **table2:**
