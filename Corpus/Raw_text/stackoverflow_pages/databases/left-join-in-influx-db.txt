*** left-join-in-influx-db ***

 I am new to influx DB. Now I need to migrate MySQL db into influxDB. I chose influx DB because it support SQL like queries. But I could not found left join in it. I have a series called statistics which contains browser_id and another series contains browser list. How can I join these 2 tables like relational database concept?
I wrote this query but it is not giving any result. 
 
 **statistics**

 
 **browsers**

 
 
 You cannot join series in InfluxDB using arbitrary columns. InfluxDB only supports joining time series based on the time column. This is a special type of join unlike the one you're used to in relational databases. Time join in InfluxDB tries to correlate points from different time series that happened at approximately the same time. You can read more about joins in InfluxDB  in the docs 
 
 Seems that now is possible. Check again documentation:  https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.8/api/query_language/#joining-series
