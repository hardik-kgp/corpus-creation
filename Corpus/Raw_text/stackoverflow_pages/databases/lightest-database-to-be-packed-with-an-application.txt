*** lightest-database-to-be-packed-with-an-application ***

 I am developing a Java Desktop Application and want a   that can be used with   and that can be packed with an application. 
 I was going to use   database. It's size is near 2 MB. But before that I wanted to have views of experts on SO. 
 Will it work with  ? 
 Actually, I am new to Hibernate and was studying that it requires a   for a database so Is Hibernate has dialect for  ? 
 
 JavaDB  (Sun's supported distribution of the open source Apache Derby),  HSQLDB  (not very active) and  H2  (the  successor of HSQLDB ) are all 100% Java embeddable database engines and can  **all**
 be used with Hibernate (i.e. there are  dialect for them). Refer to  this page  and  this one . 
 HSQLDB has the smallest footprint (~700 KB) of all of them. But feature wise (see  this comparison ), H2 is the clear winner and its footprint (~1 MB) is still smaller than Derby's one (~2 MB).  
 The final choice depends on what you need but H2 is a good compromise of features and size (in other words, a big competitor). Have a look at the mentioned comparison. 
 
 I would recommend  HSQLDB . It is small and fast and runs fine with Hibernate. Hibernate has a dialect for the Derby DB as well (haven't used it though and I think it is not officially supported by Hibernate yet). 
 
 Another Alternative would be SQLite. 
 Hibernate and SQLite 
 
 You can also try  Firebird   
 There is an embedded version and a client/server mode version
