 Anybody know of a lightweight yet durable database, written in Javascript, that can be used with Node.js.  
 I don't want the 'weight' of (great) solutions like Mongo or Couch. A simple, in memory JS database with the capability to persist to disk as a file would be enough. I would only use it to store small amounts of data.  
 Requirements: 
 
 can run in process with a node.js server application 
 can save the whole database to disk and recover after a failure 
 NO need for atomic writes or transaction supports 
 fast queries and sorting would be nice 
 only needs to support small data volumes, up to 1MB in total 
 
 I've come across TAFFY db so far but it really doesn't seem optimized for use in Node.js. Anybody seen what I'm looking for out there? 
 Thanks 
 
 I'm only familiar with Mongo and Couch, but there's also one named  Persistence . 
 
 I had the same requirements as you but couldn't find a suitable database. nStore was promising but the API was not nearly complete enough and not very coherent. 
 That's why I made  NeDB , which a dependency-less embedded database for Node.js projects. You can use it with a simple  , it is persistent, and its API is the most commonly used subset of the very well-known MongoDB API.

 NeDB  seems to be what you are looking for. From the blurb: 
 
 Embedded persistent database for Node.js, written in Javascript, with no dependency (except npm modules of course). You can think of it as a SQLite for Node.js projects, which can be used with a simple require statement. The API is a subset of MongoDB's. You can use it as a persistent or an in-memory only datastore. 
 
 
 Lokijs : A fast, in-memory document-oriented datastore for node.js, browser and cordova.  
 
 In-memory Javascript Datastore wih Persistence 
 In-Browser NoSQL db with syncing and persisting 
 a Redis-style store an npm install away   
 Persistable NoSQL db for Cordova 
 Embeddable NoSQL db with Persistence for node-webkit 
 
 LokiJS to be the ideal solution: 
 
 Mobile applications - especially HTML5 based (Cordova, Phonegap,
etc.)  
 Node.js embedded datastore for small-to-medium apps  
 Embedded in desktop application with Node Webkit

 Take a look at  http://www.tingodb.com . I believe it does what you looking for. Additionally it fully compatible with MongoDB API. This reduces implementation risks and gives you option to switch to heavy solution as your app grows.

 Try nStore, it seems like a nice key/value lightweight dembedded db for node.
See  https://github.com/creationix/nstore 
 
 I had trouble with SQLite3, nStore and Alfred. 
 What works for me is  node-dirty : 
 
 
 LevelUP aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a Node.js-friendly way.

 You can also look at UnQLite. with a node.js binding node-unqlite

 Maybe you should try  LocallyDB  it's easy-to-use and lightweight in addition to the with advanced selecting system similar to javascript conditional expression...

 UeberDB provides abstraction for various databases

 I wrote jaguarDb to handle some of the things that you are mentioning since I sometimes need a "little" database for demo or test projects too and I don't want to depend on mongoDB or another real database.
