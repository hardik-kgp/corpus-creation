*** limiting-an-sql-join ***

 I am trying to limit the following SQL statement. 
 
 What I want to do, is limit the number of 'parent' rows. IE. if I do a LIMIT 1, I would receive only one expense item, but still get all transactions associated with it. 
 How would this be achieved? 
 At this stage, if I do LIMIT 1, I get one expense, and only one transaction. 
 
 So assuming we can exclude the user table, it could be rewritten as: 
 
 Now if you want to apply a limit, you could do it like this: 
 
 Would that do what you wanted? Obviously you need to be cautious about what order your expense_ids are going to come back in, so you probably want to use ORDER BY whatever. 
 Edit: Given the MySQL limitation described in your comment below, maybe this will work:

 You'll have to specify which  **expense**
 item you want to get. The most expensive? The newest? Then join against a subquery that returns only that: 
 
 
 Since upgrading the SQL server is not an option, I may end up doing two queries.
