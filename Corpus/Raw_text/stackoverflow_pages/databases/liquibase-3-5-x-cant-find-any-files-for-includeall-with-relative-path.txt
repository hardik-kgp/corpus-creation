*** liquibase-3-5-x-cant-find-any-files-for-includeall-with-relative-path ***

 We are using liquibase 3.4.2 and want to update to 3.5.3 but all my attempts failed because liquibase doesn't find any file which are included by using  . I have tested liquibase 3.5.0, 3.5.1 and 3.5.3 (I skipped 3.5.2 because of  this blog post ). 
 My ChangeSet looks like this: 
 
 My directory structure (inside a jar which is included in a war) looks like this:

 SO:  Liquibase includeAll tag is ignored ,  includeAll path="" not working in 3.5.3, using java -jar method 
 
 
 Try this, 
 
 Start the path with file:/ and use an absolute path. This is not ideal, but I was able to get liquibase-maven-plugin 3.6.3 to load the changeset.
