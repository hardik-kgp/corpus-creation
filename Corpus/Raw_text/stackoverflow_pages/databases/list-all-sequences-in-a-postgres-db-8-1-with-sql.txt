*** list-all-sequences-in-a-postgres-db-8-1-with-sql ***

 I'm converting a db from postgres to mysql.  
 Since i cannot find a tool that does the trick itself, i'm going to convert all postgres sequences to autoincrement ids in mysql with autoincrement value. 
 So, how can i list all sequences in a  **Postgres**
 DB ( **8.1**
 version) with information about the table in which it's used, the next value etc with a SQL query? 
 Be aware that i can't use the   view in the 8.4 release. 
 
 The following query gives names of all sequences. 
 
 Typically a sequence is named as  . Simple regex pattern matching will give you the table name. 
 To get last value of a sequence use the following query: 
 
 
 Note, that starting from PostgreSQL 8.4 you can get  **all**
 information about sequences used in the database via: 
 
 
 Since I'm using a higher version of PostgreSQL (9.1), and was searching for same answer high and low, I added this answer for posterity's sake and for future searchers. 
 
 Run:  , and then  
 
 after a little bit of pain, i got it. 
 the best way to achieve this is to list all tables 
 
 and then, for each table, list all columns with attributes 
 
 then, for each column, test if it has a sequence 
 
 and then, get the information about this sequence 
 
 
 The relationship between automatically generated sequences ( such as those created for SERIAL columns ) and the parent table is modelled by the sequence owner attribute.  
 You can modify this relationship using the OWNED BY clause of the  ALTER SEQUENCE commmand 
 e.g. 
     ALTER SEQUENCE foo_id OWNED by foo_schema.foo_table  
 to set it to be linked to the table foo_table 
 or
     ALTER SEQUENCE foo_id OWNED by NONE 
 to break the connection between the sequence and any table 
 The information about this relationship is stored in the  pg_depend catalogue table .  
 the joining relationship is the link between pg_depend.objid -> pg_class.oid WHERE relkind = 'S'  - which links the sequence to the join record and then pg_depend.refobjid -> pg_class.oid WHERE relkind = 'r' , which links the join record to the owning relation ( table ) 
 This query returns all the sequence -> table dependencies in a database. The where clause filters it to only include auto generated relationships, which restricts it to only display sequences created by SERIAL typed columns. 
 
 
 sequence info : max value 
 
 sequence info : last value 
 
 
 I know this post is pretty old, but I found the solution by  CMS  to be very useful as I was looking for an automated way to link a sequence to the table AND column, and wanted to share.  The use of  pg_depend  catalog table was the key.  I expanded what was done to: 
 
 This version adds column to the list of fields returned.  With both the table name and the column name in hand, a call to  pg_set_serial_sequence  makes it easy to ensure that all sequences in the database are set correctly.  For example: 
 
 Hope this helps someone with resetting sequences! 
 
 Improvement of the previous answer: 
 
 
 This statement lists the table and column that is associated with each sequence: 
 Code:

 Partially tested but looks mostly complete. 
 
 Credit where credit is due... it's partly reverse engineered from the SQL logged from a \d on a known table that had a sequence.  I'm sure it could be cleaner too, but hey, performance wasn't a concern. 
 
 Kind of a hack, but try this: 
 
 select 'select ''' || relname  || ''' as sequence, last_value from '  || relname || '  union'
  FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c
  WHERE c.relkind IN ('S',''); 
 
 Remove the last UNION and execute the result 
 
 Get sequences by each column of each table via parsing of DEFAULT clause. This method provides  **info about to which column sequences are linked**
 and does not use  dependencies  which may not exist for some sequences. Even   function found  not all  sequences for me! 
 Solution: 
 
 Note that 1 sequence can be used in multiple tables, so it can be listed in multiple rows here. 
 
 Thanks for your help.  
 Here is the pl/pgsql function which update each sequence of a database. 
 
 
 Here is another one which has the schema name beside the sequence name 
 
 
 This function shows the last_value of each sequence. 
 It outputs a 2 columns table that says the sequence name plus it's last generated value. 
 
 
 Assuming   function declared in this post  https://stackoverflow.com/a/46721603/653539  , sequences together with their last values can be fetched using single query:
