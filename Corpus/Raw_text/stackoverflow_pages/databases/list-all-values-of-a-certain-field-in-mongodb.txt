*** list-all-values-of-a-certain-field-in-mongodb ***

 How would I get an array containing all values of a certain field for all of my documents in a collection? 
 db.collection: 
 
 "db.collection.ListAllValuesForfield(x)"
Result: [1,2,3,4,5] 
 Also, what if this field was an array? 
 
 "db.collection.ListAllValuesInArrayField(y)"
Result: [1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4] 
 Additionally, can I make this array unique? [1,2,3,4,5,6] 
 
   
 should give you an array of unique values for that field.

 Finds the distinct values for a specified field across a single collection or view and returns the results in an array. 
 
 Reference:  https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.distinct/ 
 
 This would return an array of docs, containing just it's x value...
