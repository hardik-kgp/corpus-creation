 I want a .csv list, mysql database, or any other list of all U.S states and cities, including which cities are in which state. From this list I will generate a mysql database with the following fields: 
 
 Thanks in advance. 
 
 Check out the  MySQL world sample database .  This db is used by mysql documentation as a sample db to test query on. 
 It already have a 'cities' table you are looking for. 
 
 You can get city/state information in tab-separated value format from  GeoNames.org .  The data is free, comprehensive and well structured.  For US data, grab the   file at the  free postal code data  page.  The   file on that page describes the format. 
 
 I spent a while looking for such a file, and ended up doing one myself, you can get it from here:

 Are you ready to pay for this content?
If YES, then you can find it at  **uscities.trumpetmarketing.net**

 I have also seen this information provided along with some programming books especially ones dealing with .NET database programming. Let me refer to my library and ge back to you on this:

 Please dont bother voting for this answer. There is no information here that cannot be obtained via a simple google search! 
 **Someone has posted a list here:**

 I use the  us city and county database  for this purpose and I just checked that it got updated in August. They claim to include 198,703 populated places (a GNIS term for a city or village). I see you need full state names and these names are included in a free database called  us state list . 
 Both of them are in CSV files and they provide very detailed instructions about how to import them to both local and remote MySQL servers. You can join them in a select statement to pull records with full state names for your needs. 
 
 You can find csv or sql format  or  html format at below website. They have cities+states for some countries including usa. 
 http://www.countrystatecity.com/ . They keep updating the site and doing good job. hope this will help to other developers also. 
 for usa you can check below link.

 That's a tall order.  Consider creating one by scraping the links off this page:
 WP: List of cities, towns, and villages in the US .  It is much simpler if you scrape the wiki markup code rather than the raw HTML.   
 Will require some skill at regexes or at least parsers, but should be do-able. 
 
 This helped me a great deal:  http://www.farinspace.com/us-cities-and-state-sql-dump/ 
 It has a .zip file with 3 .sql files which you can just run in ssms. 
 You may need to replace some of the weirdly encoded single quotes with double quotes.
