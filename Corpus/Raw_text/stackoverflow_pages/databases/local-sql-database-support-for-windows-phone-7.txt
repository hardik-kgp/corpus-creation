 I would like to develop for Windows Phone 7 but the lack of database support still blocks me. Has anyone found a good library, stack to use for accessing local database from WinPhone7?
Can you post links/examples of good practices to select/insert data in DB from a WinPhone7 application? 
 Thanks in advance !

 [edited] any updates available? 
 
 There are lots of options: 
 WinPhone7Db 
 Perst 
 SQLite  (and  here ) 
 siaqodb 
 db4o 
 Ninja Database Pro 
 Rapid Repository 
 Sterling 
 Effiproz 
SQL Compact Edition will be coming in the "Mango" update - due later this year 
 
 Take a look at  winphone7db .
This project implements a Isolated Storage (IsolatedStorage) based database for Windows Phone 7. The database consists of table object, each one supporting any number of columns. 
 Or you can store data on the internet and use webservices. 
 
 You'll be able to use Microsoft's SQL CE with the upcoming tools update due out in May. When end users will have Mango is another story though :) 
 
 There is a local database coming in Windows Phone 7.1 / Mango - take a look at the MSDN pre-release documentation here:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh202860%28v=VS.92%29.aspx 
 You'll need to use Linq to SQL and the databases are still bound  to individual isolated application storage contexts, but otherwise should be as you expect =)
