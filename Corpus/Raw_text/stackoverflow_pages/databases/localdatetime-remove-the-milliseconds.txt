*** localdatetime-remove-the-milliseconds ***

 I am working in java application where i am using the Java 8. 
 I have integrated the database(multiple database Oracle,Mysql,Postgres) and where in DB i string the created date. 
 the date format in DB is - 2015-07-29 16:23:28.143 
 I fetch this from DB and set in Localdatetime object  
 
 So here the issue is i dont want to show/send the millisecond in the response. i want to show/send date like 2015-07-29 16:23:28 
 I tried the formatter but it fails as it giving string and i dont want change the LocalDateTime object to String as this going to cause major change in all Java application.So want to find the solution 
 Can anybody know any solution on this.
