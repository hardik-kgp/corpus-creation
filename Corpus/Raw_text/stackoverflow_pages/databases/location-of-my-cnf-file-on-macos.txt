*** location-of-my-cnf-file-on-macos ***

 I'm trying to follow along  this tutorial  to enable remote access to MySQL. The problem is, where should   file be located? I'm using Mac OS X Lion. 
 
 This thread on the MySQL forum  says: 
 
 By default, the OS X installation does not use a my.cnf, and MySQL just uses the default values. To set up your own my.cnf, you could just create a file straight in /etc.   
 
 OS X provides example configuration files at  . 
 And if you can't find them there, MySQLWorkbench can create them for you by: 
 
 Opening a connection 
 Selecting the 'Options File' under 'INSTANCE' in the menu. 
 MySQLWorkbench will search for my.cnf and if it can't find it, it'll create it for you 
 
 
 In case of Mac OS X Maverick when MySQL is installed via Homebrew it's located at  
 
 In general, on Unix and Unix-like systems, MySQL/MariaDB programs read config/startup files in the following locations (in the specified order): 
 
  -   Global 
  - Global 
  - Global 
 
  represents the directory specified with the   option to   when MySQL was built. By default, this is the etc directory located under the compiled-in installation directory. 
 
  -    Server-specific (server only) 
 
  is an environment variable containing the path to the directory in which the server-specific   file resides. If   is not set and you start the server using the   program,   sets it to  , the MySQL base installation directory. 
 
 file specified with   if any 
  - User-specific 
  - User-specific (clients only) 
 
 Source:  Using Option Files . 
 
 Note: On Unix platforms, MySQL ignores configuration files that are world-writable. This is intentional as a security measure. 
 
 
 Additionally on Mac there is a simple way to check it. 
 
 Run:  
 This will report any filesystem activity in real-time related to that file. 
 In another Terminal, restart your MySQL/MariaDB, e.g. 
 
 or: 
 
 On terminal with  , the proper location should be shown, e.g. 
 
 So if the file doesn't exist, create one. 
 
 
 I don't know which version of MySQL you're using, but here are possible locations of the my.cnf file for version 5.5 (taken from  here ) on Mac OS X: 
 
 
 
 
 
  (the file specified with  , if any) 
 
 
 
 For MySQL 5.7 on Mac OS X El Capitan:  
 Copy default conf from  
 
 If you are using macOS Sierra and the file doesn't exists, 
run  
   
 to see the possible locations and loading/reading sequence of my.cnf for mysql then create my.cnf file in one of the suggested directories then add the following line  
 
 You can   then edit the file to add sql mode by  
   
 Then restart mysql, voilaah you are good to go. happy coding 
 
 The  current MySQL package for Mac OS X Mavericks  (mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64 at the time of this writing) automatically creates a my.cnf during installation.  
 It is located at  
Adapt your path according to your version. 
 
 So none of these things worked for me.  I am using the current dmg install of mysql community server.  ps shows that all of the most critical parameters normally in my.cnf are passed on the command line, and I couldn't figure out where that was coming from.  After doing a full text search of my box I found it in: 
 
 So you can either change them there, or take them out so it will actually respect the ones you have in your my.cnf wherever you decided to put it. 
 Enjoy! 
 Example of the file info found in that file: 
 
 
 You can open a terminal and type  
 
 In mysql 5.6.22, which I installed it from Homebrew, the path of my.cnf is  
 
 
 macOs sierra 10.12.6
mysql version : 5.7.18_1
I run  locate my.cnf  and the path is  
 
 /usr/local/etc/my.cnf 
 
 hope it help. 
 
 You can create your file under any directory you want. After creation, you can "tell" the path to mysql config: 
 
 
 You can check the file  
  and see from where   is being read from.  
 Usually it is from   or   or  
 
 For MAMP 3.5 Mac El Capitan, create a separate empty config file and write your additional settings for mysql 
 
 And Add like this  
 
 
 Open Terminal and use below command: 
 
 
 READ THE DOCS! 
 The MySQL Documents for which version you are using will help. 
It is usually described as a   or  . 
The docs have the location of these files in the documentation, As well as other   information like the location & small examples of what the config file must look like. 
 MySQL Version 8 
 MySQL Version 5.7 
 MySQL Version 5.6 
 MySQL Version 5.5 
 MySQL Version 5.6 Japanese 
 **Important Notes:**

 
 On Unix platforms, MySQL ignores configuration files that are world-writable. 
 This is intentional as a security measure. 
 
 In other words, if you have the wrong permissions set on your config file the will NOT load. 
 Example of initial setup permission of one of the config files: 
 
 **Note:**

 
 It is possible to use   directives in option files to include other option files and   to search specific directories for option files..... 
 ... **MySQL makes no guarantee about the order in which option files in the directory will be read**
... 
 Any files to be found and included using the !includedir directive on Unix operating systems must have file names ending in  . On Windows, this directive checks for files with the   or   extension. 
 
 Examples of how to find your location of your config or log files ect.: 
 **SQL**

 This will not show you the config file but will help you locate your installation files/folders. 
 MySQL Version 5.7 & 8+ 
 
 MySQL Version <= 5.6

 **My System:**

 
 
 
 
 I checked in macOS Sierra, the homebrew installed  
 The support files are located at  
 
 Just copy   as   or   and the configuration will be picked up on restart. 
 
 macOS High Sierra
version 10.13.6 
 mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.22, for osx10.13 (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper

 Default options are read from the following files in the given order: 
 
 
 I am using mysql version 5.7.17 in macOS High Sierra version 10.13.3 and I have found the mysql config file here.  
 
 
 it should be usually under   on mac if you do not find it you can create one 
 
 For Mac , what worked for me is creating a .my.cnf file in my ~ path. Hope this helps. 
 
 Copy /usr/local/opt/mysql/support-files/my-default.cnf as /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf and then restart mysql. 
 
 For me in sierra version 
 copy the default configuration at: 
 
 /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.27/support-files/my-default.cnf 
 
 to 
 
 /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.27/my.cnf 
 
 
 In my case, the file did not exist. In MySQL Workbench I went to OPTIONS FILE and found some default values. I clicked apply. It asked for permission. It then created the my.cnf file under /etc. However, it is very important to keep in mind that the first time you click "apply", you do not make any changes to the default configuration. Once the file has been created, you can make changes which will be applied when you click "apply". Otherwise you will not be shown the apply button when you make changes.  
 
 After the 5.7.18 version of MySQL, it does not provide the default configuration file in support-files directory.
So you can create my.cnf file  **manually**
 in the location where MySQL will read, like /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and add the configuration you want to add in the file. 
 
 rDefault options are read from the following files in the given order:
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /usr/local/mysql/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf 
 
 /private/etc/my.cnf for Catalina
