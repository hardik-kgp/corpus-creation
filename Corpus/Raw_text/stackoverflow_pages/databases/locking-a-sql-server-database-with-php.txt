*** locking-a-sql-server-database-with-php ***

 I'm wanting extra security for a particular point in my web app. So I want to lock the database (SQL Server 2005). Any suggestions or is this even necessary with SQL Server? 
 **Edit on question:**

 The query is failing silently with no errors messages logged, and does not occur inside of a transaction. 
 **Final Solution:**

 I never was able to solve the problem, however what I wound up doing was switching to MySQL and using a transactional level query here. This was not the main or even a primary reason to switch. I had been having problems with SQL Server and it allowed me to have our CMS and various other tools all running on the same database. Previous we had a SQL Server and a MySQL database running to run our site. The port was a bit on the time consuming however in the long run I feel it will work much better for the site and the business. 
 
 I suppose you have three options. 
 
 Set user permissions so that user x can only read from the database. 
 Set the database into single user mode so only one connection can access it 
 sp_dboption 'myDataBaseName', single, true 
 Set the database to readonly 
 sp_dboption 'myDataBaseName', read only, true
