 I am currently using Redis for my app, and its features are really excellent for my application (lists, sets, sorted sets etc.).  
 My application relies heavily on sorted sets, lists, sets. And their related functions (push to a list, get list, union of sets etc. The only problem I am facing right now is that my data is large, and most of my data does not need to be in memory, and I want to store them on disk. 
 **I need an  on-disk  database with redis data structures ** 
 I read about Cassandra but I am not sure if it supports sorted sets, sets, lists. Or at least if it does, I could not find methods to manipulate them the way Redis does. 
 Thanks.

another REDIS protocol replacement 
with LMDB, RocksDB and LevelDB disk-based backend 
 nice benchmarks 
 
 There are numerous on-disk databases with Redis-like datastructures or even trying to be drop-in protocol-compatible replacements for Redis.  
 There are excellent recommendations in " Is there something like Redis DB, but not limited with RAM size? " - pity the community considers such questions to be off-topic. 
 In particular,  SSDB  is an actively-maintained Redis-like on-disk database (but not directly compatible), and  Ardb  is an actively-maintained drop-in replacement for Redis that stores the data on disk. Disclaimer: I have not used either of them (yet). 
 
 try Edis - Erlang implementation of Redis based on leveldb  http://inaka.github.io/edis/ 
 
 I am encouraging you to learn Cassandra, while it has some things similar to key/value and sets, it is very different from Redis. 
 We currently moving one project from Redis (we use sadd / spop) to TokyoCabinet / KyotoCabinet via Memcached protocol. For the moment things looks good and very soon I will publish the lib on github - will be available here: 
 https://github.com/nmmmnu 
 and project will be called Simple Message Queue. It will support sadd / spop / sismember only. Also in Python you will be able to use new object instead of Redis object, but only for these three commands. 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 Update 2014.07: 
 Here is the project I am speaking about.  
 https://github.com/nmmmnu/MessageQueue 
 It implements both Redis and Memcached protocols. For back-end it uses memory ndb/mdb or berkeley db.
