 I'm looking for a light-weight database library that I can compile into a C++ application. 
 Does any such exist? 
 
 For pure XML embedded database you might want to peek at  Oracle Berkeley DB XML . 
 
 SQLite . Not flat-file, but it is file based, can be easily embedded in apps.  
 
 Maybe this very lightweight XML library can also be of help:  RapidXML . It's an XML parser, not a database library, but depending on your application that might be enough (you mention a flatfile XML data storage). 
 
 You can also look at berkleyDB 
 From  wikipedia : 
 
 Berkeley DB (BDB) is a computer
  software library that provides a
  high-performance embedded database,
  with bindings in C, C++, Java, Perl,
  Python, Ruby, Tcl, Smalltalk, and many
  other programming languages. BDB
  stores arbitrary key/data pairs as
  byte arrays, and supports multiple
  data items for a single key. BDB can
  support thousands of simultaneous
  threads of control or concurrent
  processes manipulating databases as
  large as 256 terabytes, on a wide
  variety of operating systems including
  most Unix-like and Windows systems,
  and real-time operating systems.
