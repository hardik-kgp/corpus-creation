 We have SQLite for RDBMS, but are there any disk-based, light-memory-usage key-value databases? In other words, a key-value store that can run on a  small amount of memory  with a  larger  amount of data. I would like to use it on lower-power machines with not a lot of free memory. 
 It seems that  BerkeleyDB  and  LevelDB  are both options. 
 
 Take a look at  MemcacheDB . 
 
 It sounds like you're looking for a disk-based key-value store that is performant even when the data won't fit in memory. 
 Like @Ofer Zelig mentioned, fast is relative. But I think it's helpful to look at both the performance benchmarks and the operational guides for a given database. Many, including  Redis , specify that you should provide enough memory so that all of the data (or all of the indexes) can fit in memory. That can be cost-prohibitive for some applications. 
 I suggest taking a look at FoundationDB. Its default  storage engine , 'ssd', is designed for large databases that don't fit in memory. The  performance benchmarks  all use a large data set that doesn't fit in RAM, so you can see if that is fast enough for you.  
 As a bonus, FoundationDB is designed to run as a distributed cluster and supports multiple data models.
