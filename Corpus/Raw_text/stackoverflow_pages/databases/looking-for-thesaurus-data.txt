 Looking for an open-source Thesaurus dataset which contains as many English root words and synonyms as possible. Any solutions and associated links to data would be appreciated. 
 
 Thanks to Grady Ward for releasing  http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/  in the public domain ;)

 Also, OpenOffice.org has a thesaurus and is open source. You should be able to use their thesaurus database at least in another open source project.
