*** lua-script-for-redis-which-sums-the-values-of-keys ***

 I am building out my first Redis server side script ( for debugging ) and my lack of Lua experience has me quite stuck. 
 Essentially have a dataset of K/V pairs (containing ~1000 values) from which I want to list all the KEYS that match a pattern. For example in redis-cli: 
 
 Based on the above output I want to return the sum of those keys by executing a Lua script. Currently I have the following on my  
 
 While the above script is likely incorrect, trying even   by itself produces the following error 
 
 root@carlos:~# redis-cli EVAL "$(cat sum.lua)" 
 (error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'eval' command 
 
 I have tried a number of iterations of my syntax to no avail. Any ideas? 
 Thanks 
 
 
  requires a minimum of two arguments; the script and the number of keys you are passing to the script. In this case, you are passing zero keys, meaning the script can be invoked as follows: 
 
 or: 
 
 Your loop structure for iterating over the values returned from   was incorrect; I have fixed it for you. 
 You need to convert the value returned from   from a string to a number using Lua's   function. 
 
 With the above changes made, the following script should work for you:
