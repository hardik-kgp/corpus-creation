*** magento-catching-exceptions-and-rolling-back-database-transactions ***

 I'm working on a Magento module and need to know if it's possible to roll back a series of model saves. Basically, I have five models plus several from my module that I need to save one after the other: 
 
 My problem is that whenever any of these models throw an exception, I need to go into MySQL and manually delete all the rows that were saved. This is very unproductive. 
 I'm pretty sure that Magento doesn't have a rollback procedure that I can access in my context. For example, I looked in   and in the save method, the rollback mechanisms are all protected. 
 So, my question is, is there some best practice for doing database transactions in Magento that I should be aware of? 
 
 I've seen the following used in core code, and it looks like its just what you ordered. 
 
 The   object allows you to add Magento objects, and perform a mass save on them.  Give that a try, and I'd love to hear how this does, or doesn't, work for you in the comments.
