*** magento-installation-stuck-at-configuration ***

 I am not sure what is going wrong when I am trying to install magento to my local ubuntu machine. 
I did all the steps mentionsed in the  magento wiki . Everything goes well until I reach the point where I am  here  which is the magento config page. When I try and continue after entering the necessary details like host, database name and user name and submit it comes back to the same page. I checked for everything like db in my phomyadmin panel and it still gets stuck there. What is the possible reason for that. 
 Thanks 
 
 You have to create a database first and then proceed further. 
 Step 1 - First create a database with name of your choice like magento 
 Step 2 - Use that database name in the installation form now 
 Step 3 - Continue 
 Hope this solves your problem. 
 
 Have you try with 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost ?
They have some trouble on login in the admin section. 
 And check the user/password in the config too ! 
 
 I solved this modifing  app/code/core/Mage/Install/etc/config.xml  (near 71th string) this 
 
 for this 
 
 
 Verify that you meet the following requirements: 
 http://www.magentocommerce.com/system-requirements 
 Magento only runs on php 5.2.x, not 5.3. Also make sure the extensions listed on the requirements page are enabled. 
 Might be different for you, but I can check the php version using 
 php -v 
 **Edit**

 Also what c-verde said about using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost:
This isn't your current problem, but you'll run into it later. You need to be able to accept cookies to log into Magento. Your browser won't accept cookies for local sites.   
 In /etc/hosts you need to add
127.0.0.1 localhost.com 
 And when you install magento you need to use either localhost.com or 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost.  
 I didn't have this problem with linux, but when installing on windows, it took several minutes after the config page to set up magento. Make sure the browser isn't doing anything. 
 
 Before running the installation of  **Magento**
:  
 
 Navigate to the   file located in  
 You must  **comment out the last 3 lines**
 in the  : 
 
 
 
 Tick the box for 
 
 Skip Base URL Validation Before the Next Step
  Check this box only if it is not possible to automatically validate the Base URL. 
 
 I also added to my C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file 
 
 127.0.0.1 www.localhost.com 
 
 and removed my magento directory and database tables and started from scratch.  
 Works for me now.  
 
 I did this and it worked! 
 Navigate to the Varien.php file located in magento/app/code/core/Mage/core/Model/Session/Abstract/Varien.php
You must comment out the last 3 lines in the $cookieParams array: 
 
 ); 
 and if you got InnoDB error then do this
Go To Line 59 of the file app/code/core/Mage/Install/Model/Installer/Db/Mysql4.php 
 Use following code instead of current one 
 
 
 Make sure you load php5-mysql extenion. Thats how I solved my problem.
I loaded with   (adding 127.0.0.1 localhost.com to /etc/hosts), it gave my error  . Otherwise with  , no error just reloading in configuration page) 
 
 I had also been through this problem. I had just create the db first named "magento" and put the 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. I think, instead of 127.0.0.1, 'localhost' should also work if you had configure it. The problem might be because you didn't have the password for the database but you trying to put the password while installing the magento. Hope this helps some of them. 
 
 I had the same problem. Turned out that I was missing a php module but no error was displayed. Megento are now providing a simple php script that checks if the required modules are available and displays an appropriate message if you are missing any of them.  
 You can find it here -  http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/how-do-i-know-if-my-server-is-compatible-with-magento 
 
 You have to submit username and password as 'root' and 'password' as per db setting 
 
 My answer might be late for the PM, but probably useful to those who landed in this page via google. 
 My experience was that the whole configuration page is a blank page, without any form regarding database, user info or anything. 
 I fixed it by modifying the  **{Megento Path}/app/etc/config.xml**
 file. 
 
 Change the value of the  **host**
 item to anything other than localhost.
Then you get those forms and everything and can move on. 
 
 I guess you are missing the port name on which your mysql is running. Try using the port after your hostname for eg. localhost:3306 ,was my configuration settings along with database name and password of your mysql.
