*** make-h2-treat-quoted-name-and-unquoted-name-as-the-same ***

 H2 seems to make a difference between name with quote and name without quote. Is there a way to make it treat them the same way? 
 Here's the tests that I've done : 
 
 Here are the queries : 
 
 What can I do to make those queries work with H2? 
 
 Quotes names in H2 are case sensitive , as required by the SQL specification. That means this will work: 
 
 but this will not: 
 
 Unquotes names are not case sensitive in H2 . They are normally converted to uppercase (as in Oracle and other databases). That means the statements  
 
 are the same as 
 
 In that H2 behaves in the same way as Oracle. This is a bit different on how other databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL deal with identifier names. H2 has a compatibility feature: If you append   to the database URL, unquotes identifiers are not converted to uppercase, that means they are case sensitive as well. But you need append this  when creating the database, and each time you use it (if you append the setting for existing databases, the identifiers of existing objects are already converted to uppercase). 
 By the way, this has nothing to do with the  function UPPER , which is meant for data. Your question is about identifiers, not data.
