*** many-to-many-relationships-examples ***

 I haven't found any MYSQL many-to-many relationships examples here and in google. What I am looking is to see a very simple example with php+mysql showing database's results. Can anybody write a very simple example? 
 
 Example scenario: students and courses at a university. A given student might be on several courses, and naturally a course will usually have many students. 
 Example tables, simple design: 
 
 Find all students registered for a course: 
 
 Find all courses taken by a given student: 
 
 
 Here's a quick and dirty example of the SQL involved. I don't see any need to muddy up the concept with php. Just retrieve the set like you would any other. 
 In this example, there are many names, and many colors. People are allowed to have more than one favorite color, and many people can have the same favorite color. Hence many to many. 
 
 Does that help?
