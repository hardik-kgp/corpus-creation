*** many-to-one-with-multiple-target-entities ***

 This seems simple but I can't get it right: 
 There are three entities:  ,   and  . Snack has the fields  ,   and  . Food is a reference to  either  one fruit  or  one vegetable. So it is basically a many-to-one/one-to-many relationship as one snack will always only hold one food. But there is more than one target entity. 
 How would I map this in Doctrine2? 
 A simple solution I would have used before knowing Doctrine2 would be to use two fields:   and  . But how can I make a connection from food type to the correct entity? I thought about an array of JoinColumns but can't find a way to connect the correct entity. I also had a look at mapped superclasses because there is a DiscriminatorColumn, but it also seems to be the wrong approach. If I get it right the superclass can't be an entity itself - so I cannot create a food entity. 
 Any help is appreciated. I'm sure I am missing something simple here. 
 
 You can create a (abstract) mapped superclass called  , which can hold some basic information for   and  . 
 The keyword for your question is  , this is the documentation for it:  https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.6/reference/inheritance-mapping.html#inheritance-mapping 
 Then you could reference this mapped superclass in your entity relationship.
