*** map-existing-database-table-for-laravel ***

 I am looking for a way to map existing tables in a project with the Eloquent ORM and use them in code. I use a MySQL database and plan to migrate to MSSQL. Any way points are appreciated.  
 
 You'll have to do this manually. 
 i.e., create an eloquent model for each of the tables you want access to in your code using eloquent. 
 If you don't have timestamps named created_at and updated_at, in your model you can disable those columns. 
 **Manually**

 If you have a users table you could 'map' it with a   file in your models folder like this 
 
 **Via artisan**

 You can use  Jeffrey Ways Laravel Generators  to help streamline the initial creation of your models, however you'll still need to make the timestamp modification manually. 
 
 This looks like an old post, but it was edited a couple of days ago, so I don't know if the original author is looking for a solution again, but if someone needs this info, here is a packagist package for Laravel 5 to do what you are asking. 
 Laravel 5 model generator from existing schema:
 https://packagist.org/packages/ignasbernotas/laravel-model-generator 
 Hope that helps someone! 
 
 There is also a  Eloquent Model Generator  library. It can be used for generating Eloquent models using database tables as a source. Generated model will include relation methods, docblocks for magic field and relations and several additional properties. 
 
 Another here:  https://github.com/Xethron/migrations-generator .  
 You'll only want to use these generators for local development, so you don't want to update the production providers array in config/app.php. Instead, add the provider in app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php.  
 For more details look here -  https://packagist.org/packages/ignasbernotas/laravel-model-generator#user-content-installation 
 
 You can also use SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) to port the database to SQL Server, but you will still need to write your own models to match the schema.

 Still this might help get halfway there, from both sides of the puzzle.
