*** mapping-java-boolean-to-oracle-number-column-with-jpa-and-hibernate ***

 I have a property created like this in my model: 
 
 My RDBMS is Oracle and the   column is of type  . 
 How can I use the Restrictions API to achieve the following functionality? 
 
 
 Hibernate maps the   Java type to Oracle   automatically.  
 So, you can use a   value in your entity mappings, JPQL or Criteria queries and the generated SQL will use the database   format instead. 
 
 I don't recommend to use Boolean, you should use boolean instead to prevent NPE, cause boolean value just has two available values - true or false. What does it mean null for boolean?? It's a rare case when you need wrapper type Boolean.
Oracle - number(1) default 0 not null.
