 Is there a standard way to convert  matlab    (matlab formated data) files to Panda  ?  
 I am aware that a workaround is possible by using   but I am wondering whether there is a straightforward way to do it. 
 
 I found 2 way: scipy or mat4py. 
 
 mat4py 
 
 
 Load data from MAT-file 
 The function loadmat loads all variables stored in the MAT-file into a
  simple Python data structure, using only Pythonâ€™s dict and list
  objects. Numeric and cell arrays are converted to row-ordered nested
  lists. Arrays are squeezed to eliminate arrays with only one element.
  The resulting data structure is composed of simple types that are
  compatible with the JSON format. 
 
 Example: Load a MAT-file into a Python data structure: 
 
 From: 
 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mat4py/0.1.0 
 
 Scipy:

 Finally you can use PyHogs but still use scipy: 
 
 
 Reading complex   files. 
 This notebook shows an example of reading a Matlab .mat file,
  converting the data into a usable dictionary with loops, a simple plot
  of the data.

 Ways to do this: 
As you mentioned scipy 
 
 Using the  matlab engine :
