*** max-length-of-tzname-field-timezone-identifier-name ***

 I am trying to find the max length of a timezone identifier. This is the string used as the timezone name (e.g. "America/New_York"). The tz database is not helpful; I could not find implementation details. 
 Microsoft (.NET Framework 4.5) suggests a max length of 32 , but this seems to be a limitation of their registry. 
 libc points to a limit called "_POSIX_TZNAME_MAX", which is 3 characters long , but this is an absolute minimum requirement for POSIX compliance. Typically, I guess an implementation will use more. 
 So the real question is: What's an acceptable string length to safely store timezone "tzname" / identifier name? 
 
 Why not use a container that doesn't care what the length is -- as e.g.   ? 
 Now, it so happens that I was working recently with the TZ db as supplied in the common csv format (eg here  in a file from CERN ) but the same format is also used in the Boost sources. 
 With that data, I am seeing a maximum length of 28: 
 
 We can also look at a histogram: 
 
 
 This uses code which I have in my RcppBDT package's  SVN repo on R-Forge  but not yet in the  CRAN version  of the package.
