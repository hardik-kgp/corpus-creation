*** max-size-of-websql-sqlite-database-inside-uiwebview-phonegap ***

 It seems to have been asked before but I did not find a satisfactory answer.
 
When creating a IOS Phone gap application, well any html5 application on an IPAD is their a restriction to the size of the database when compiled to a native application? I know that in general there is a 5MB limit to native storage for web applications. Is this limitation also there for native web view apps? 
 
 Yes, the WebKit DB is also limited to 5mo. 
 You can trick the system with this solution:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-330?focusedCommentId=13237796&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13237796 
 Or you can use a native SQLite DB (same as WebSQL) with a phonegap plugin. That plugin save the database in the Document folder (or you can specify another folder), and there is no size limit and data is saved by iCloud. (But take care, Apple don't really like apps wasting iCloud storage) 
 Here is the Native SQLite phonegap plugin :  https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin  Regarding this plugin, there are some differences between the WebSQL API, here is an adaptor:  https://gist.github.com/2009518 
 And if the data are important, you should save it to a server. I wrote a small lib to synchronize the SQlite DB to a server :  https://github.com/orbitaloop/WebSqlSync
