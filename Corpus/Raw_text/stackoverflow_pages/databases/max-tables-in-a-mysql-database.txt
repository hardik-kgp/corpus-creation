*** max-tables-in-a-mysql-database ***

 Is it bad to have too many tables in a database? I have about 160 tables in one database. Is it better to split it into several database rather than using a single database? Single database is more convenient for me. 
 
 There  are no server limits  on the number of tables in a MySQL database. You will definitely have no problems with 160 tables, and you don't need to split them into multiple databases. 
 You will not gain performance by splitting your tables into multiple databases. If performance remains an issue, you could consider  using per-table tablespaces  in order to place some sets of tables on different physical disks. 
 
 according to  MySQL reference manual : 
 
 MySQL has no limit on the number of tables. The underlying file system may have a limit on the number of files that represent tables. Individual storage engines may impose engine-specific constraints. InnoDB permits up to 4 billion tables.  
 
 
 160 tables isn't radically huge. 
 16,000 might be...probably would be...more unreasonable - such databases exist in ERP or CRM systems (even into the 40-50K tables range, but many of those tables are not actually used, or are only barely used). 
 Even so, the typical DBMS will 'handle' such large databases, but there is more strain on the system catalog than usual in such systems. 
 
 160 is still ok. it makes SQL command more faster than making too many contents under a single table. In my case I have 8,545,214 tables in a single Mysql database. I dont want to store millions of user in a single database that's why I used multiple table to store each post a user done. it makes mysql more faster than searching on a single table with millions of rows.
