*** maximum-execution-time-in-phpmyadmin ***

 When I try to execute (some) queries in phpMyadmin I get this error 
 
 Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 60 seconds exceeded in
  C:\xampp\phpmyadmin\libraries\dbi\mysql.dbi.lib.php on line 140 
 
 because I have a very large table (over 9 millions records) 
 I have edited the file C:\xampp\php\php.ini  
 and changed the value of "max execution time" from 60 to 1000 then restarts the PHP and still have the same error. 
 Any solution? 
 
 I have the same error, please go to 
 
 xampp\phpMyAdmin\libraries\config.default.php 
 
 Look for :  
 You can change '600' to any higher value, like '6000'. 
 Maximum execution time in seconds is (0 for no limit).  
 This will fix your error. 
 
 **For Xampp version on Windows**

 **Add**
 this line to  **xampp\phpmyadmin\config.inc.php**

 
 And Change  **xampp\php\php.ini**
 to 
 
 And change  **xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini**

 
 
 I faced the same problem while executing a curl.
I got it right when I changed the following in the   file: 
 
 and also  
 
 Probably your problem should be solved by making above two changes and restarting the apache server. 
 Even after changing the above the problem persists and if you think it's because of some database operation using mysql you can try changing this also: 
 
 
 All this should be changed in php.ini file and apache server should be
  restarted to see the changes. 
 
 
 Your change should work. However, there are potentially few php.ini configuration files with the 'xampp' stack. Try to identify whether or not there's an 'apache' specific php.ini. One potential location is: 
 C:\xampp\apache\bin\php.ini 
 
 Changing   for a web application requires restarting Apache. 
 You should verify that the change took place by running a PHP script that executes the function  .  The output of that function will tell you a lot of PHP parameters, including the timeout value. 
 You might also have changed a copy of   that is not the same file used by Apache. 
 
  or create file name called   and enter the first line   then save it and put the file in your root folder of your application. 
 That's it. Good luck. 
 
 Well for Wamp User, 
 Go to:  
 Under line 536,  
 and change the value from 0 to 6000. e.g 
 
 To 
 
 Restart wamp server and phew. 
 It works like magic ! 
 
 In php.ini you must check mysql.connect_timeout either. 
That's responsible for socket closing and returning the Fatal.
So, for example, change it to: 
 
 That time will be always counted in seconds, so in my example you have 1 hour. 
 
 Probabily you are using XMAPP as service, to restart XMAPP properly, you have to open XMAPP control panel un-check  both  "Svc" mdodules against Apache and MySQL. Then click on exit, now restart XMAPP and you are done.  
 
 Go to  
 Find this line: 
 
 And change its value to any number you want. Restart Apache. 
 
 'ZERO' for unlimited time. 
 C:\Apache24\htdocs\phpmyadmin\libraries\Config.class.php 
 
 
 You could also import the large file right from MySQL as query or a PHP query. 
 500,000 rows just took me 18 seconds to import on local server, using this method. 
 (create table first) - then: 
 
 
 What worked for me on WAMP was modifying file:
\Wamp64\alias\phpmyadmin.conf, lines: 
 
 I did not have to change the library file.
