*** maximum-length-for-mysql-type-text ***

 I'm creating a form for sending private messages and want to set the   value of a textarea appropriate to the max length of a   field in my MySQL database table. How many characters can a type text field store? 
 If a lot, would I be able to specify length in the database text type field as I would with varchar? 
 
 See for maximum numbers:
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html 
 
 L is the number of bytes in your text field. So the maximum number of chars for text is 2 16 -1 (using single-byte characters). Means 65 535 chars(using single-byte characters). 
 **UTF-8/MultiByte encoding**
: using MultiByte encoding each character might consume more than 1 byte of space. For UTF-8 space consumption is between 1 to 4 bytes per char. 
 
 TINYTEXT: 256 bytes 
TEXT: 65,535 bytes 
MEDIUMTEXT: 16,777,215 bytes 
LONGTEXT: 4,294,967,295 bytes 
 
 
 Note: If using multibyte characters (like Arabic letters where each character takes 2 bytes), the column "Exact Max. Length Allowed" will have different length. For example: if you use 2-bytes characters, the exact maximum length for   would be 127 characters. Basically, it's the number of bytes allowed -1. 
 
 Acording to  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-requirements.html , the limit is  , or 64k. 
 You shouldn't need to concern yourself with limiting it, it's automatically broken down into chunks that get added as the string grows, so it won't always blindly use 64k. 
 
 
 How many characters can a type text field store? 
 
 According to  Documentation  You can use maximum of 21,844 characters if the charset is UTF8

 You dont need to specify the length. If you need more character use data types MEDIUMTEXT or LONGTEXT. With VARCHAR, specifieng length is not for Storage requirement, it is only for how the data is retrieved from data base. 
 
 
 
 
  is a string data type that can store up to to   characters. 
  is a string data type that can store up to   characters.   is commonly used for brief articles. 
  is a string data type with a maximum length of   characters. Use   if you need to store large text, such as a chapter of a novel. 
 
  is a string data type that can store up to 65,535 characters.
But still if you want to store more data then change its data type to  
 ALTER TABLE   CHANGE   LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET   COLLATE   NOT NULL; 
 
 For the MySql version 8.0. 
 **Numeric Type Storage Requirements**

 
 Values for DECIMAL (and NUMERIC) columns are represented using a binary format that packs nine decimal (base 10) digits into four bytes. Storage for the integer and fractional parts of each value are determined separately. Each multiple of nine digits requires four bytes, and the “leftover” digits require some fraction of four bytes. The storage required for excess digits is given by the following table. 
 Date and Time Type Storage Requirements
For TIME, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP columns, the storage required for tables created before MySQL 5.6.4 differs from tables created from 5.6.4 on. This is due to a change in 5.6.4 that permits these types to have a fractional part, which requires from 0 to 3 bytes. 
 
 As of MySQL 5.6.4, storage for YEAR and DATE remains unchanged. However, TIME, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP are represented differently. DATETIME is packed more efficiently, requiring 5 rather than 8 bytes for the nonfractional part, and all three parts have a fractional part that requires from 0 to 3 bytes, depending on the fractional seconds precision of stored values. 
 
 For example, TIME(0), TIME(2), TIME(4), and TIME(6) use 3, 4, 5, and 6 bytes, respectively. TIME and TIME(0) are equivalent and require the same storage. 
 For details about internal representation of temporal values, see MySQL Internals: Important Algorithms and Structures. 
 String Type Storage Requirements
In the following table, M represents the declared column length in characters for nonbinary string types and bytes for binary string types. L represents the actual length in bytes of a given string value.
