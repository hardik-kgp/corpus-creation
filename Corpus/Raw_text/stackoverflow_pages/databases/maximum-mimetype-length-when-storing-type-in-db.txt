*** maximum-mimetype-length-when-storing-type-in-db ***

 What are people using as the length of a MIMEType field in their databases? The longest one we've seen so far is 72 bytes: 
 
 but I'm just waiting for a longer one. We're using 250 now, but has anyone seen a longer MIMEType than that? 
 Edit: From the accepted answer, 127 for type and sub-type each, so that's 254 max, plus the '/' is a limit of 255 for the combined value. 
 
 According to RFC 4288 "Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures", type (eg. "application") and subtype (eg "vnd...") both  can be max 127 characters . You do the math :) 
 **Edit:**
 Meanwhile, that document has been obsoleted by  RFC 6838 , which does not alter the maximum size but adds a remark: 
 
 Also note that while this syntax allows names of up to 127
  characters, implementation limits may make such long names 
  problematic. For this reason,   and   SHOULD 
  be limited to 64 characters.
