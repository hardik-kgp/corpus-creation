 I am trying to create a new database using Entity Framework but I always getting that exception 
 
 Directory lookup for the file "c:\users\oren\documents\visual studio 2012\Projects\ResturantSite\ResturantSite\App_Data\ResturantSite.SiteContext.mdf" failed with the operating system error 2(The system cannot find the file specified.). 
  CREATE DATABASE failed. Some file names listed could not be created. Check related errors 
 Line 28:                 using (var db  = new SiteContext()) 
  Line 29:                 { 
  Line 30:                     db.User.Add(u); 
  Line 31:                     db.SaveChanges(); 
  Line 32:                 }   
 
 Line 30 throws the exception 
 I hope somebody can help 
 
 Your application is missing the   folder. Right click on your project, select  , then   and choose the   folder. 
 This ensures the correct folder exists for your application.
