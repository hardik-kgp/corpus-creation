*** meteor-mongo-insert-failed-access-denied ***

 The first insert works fine, but the second Gives "Insert Failed: 403 -- Access denied" in the console. Auto subscribe is enabled, and I am on the auth branch. How do I set up my code so that I have a server MongoDB that clients can write to? 
 
 
 Because you are working with auth, you must allow or deny clients trying to do inserts, updates, removes, and fetches. To fix this specific issue you must add Collection.allow() to let the client's insert work. 
 
 
 Use method allow() in the Collection People. This method assign access CRUD. 
 
 
 I've encountered this error after I removed  **insecure**
 package from my project. 
 
 Following fixed my problem. 
 
 
 If you have only testing project such as simple-todos tutorial, you can solve it with adding the insecure package
