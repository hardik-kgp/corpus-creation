 I have changed database from  postgresql  to  mysql , but I don't know how to transfer data from one to other. 
 Does anyone know any command by which I can copy/migrate my database from  postgresql  to  mysql ? 
 
 Faced the problem a few years ago, and used  **pg2mysql**

 **EDIT 21 july 2019**
 :  **this fork**
 seems a better option (patches, light maintenance) 
 
 You can use the  MySQL Workbench  which can import from a variety of database types, including Postgres. 
 
 Dbeaver  is the perfect solution for painless migration, column to column mapping, character encoding and also open source.
