*** minimum-grants-needed-by-mysqldump-for-dumping-a-full-schema-triggers-are-miss ***

 I have a MySQL user called  dump  with the following perms: 
 
 I want to dump all data (included triggers and procedures) using the  dump  user. I call mysqldump in the following way: 
 
 Everything is OK with the dumped file except for the  **triggers, they are missing**
!! 
 The triggers are dumped correctly if I try mysqldump with  root  MySQL user: 
 
 So, I guess it is a perms issue... what are the  **extra grants my **
**dump**
** MySQL user needs for doing the full dump correctly?**
  
 
 Assuming by full dump you also mean the  s and the  s, you would need: 
 
 and if you have  s that execute a function, then unfortunately you also need  . 
 My own problem is: why do I need   if I only want to make a no-data dump? 
 
 I found the extra GRANT I needed!! 
 
 Here you have the reference on the official doc:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_trigger 
 
 The TRIGGER privilege enables trigger operations. You must have this privilege for a table to create, drop, or execute triggers for that table. 
 
 
 I found, that sometime if VIEW DEFINER user does not exist, dump fails. 
 Change it, as described  there 
 
 In addition to  Jannes  answer, when using mysqldump with  **--tab**
 option (produces a tab-separated text file for each dumped table), your MySQL user  **must be granted**
 the   privilege as well: 
 
 
 Official docs reference:  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_tab 
 Mentioned in this section: 
 
 This option should be used only when mysqldump is run on the same
  machine as the mysqld server. Because the server creates *.txt files
  in the directory that you specify, the directory must be writable by
  the server and the MySQL account that you use must have the FILE
  privilege. Because mysqldump creates *.sql in the same directory, it
  must be writable by your system login account.
