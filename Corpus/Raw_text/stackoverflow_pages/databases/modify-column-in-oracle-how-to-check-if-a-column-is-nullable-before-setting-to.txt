*** modify-column-in-oracle-how-to-check-if-a-column-is-nullable-before-setting-to ***

 I'm trying to fill in for a colleague in doing some Oracle work, and ran into a snag.  In attempting to write a script to modify a column to nullable, I ran into the lovely ORA-01451 error: 
 
 This is happening because the column is already NULL.  We have several databases that need to be udpated, so in my faulty assumption I figured setting it to NULL should work across the board to make sure everybody was up to date, regardless of whether they had manually set this column to nullable or not.  However, this apparently causes an error for some folks who already have the column as nullable. 
 How does one check if a column is already nullable so as to avoid the error?  Something that would accomplish this idea: 
 
 
 You could do this in PL/SQL: 
 
 
 just do the alter table and catch the exception. 
 
 if you don't want to use PL/SQL 
 
 or just do the alter table and ignore the error.
