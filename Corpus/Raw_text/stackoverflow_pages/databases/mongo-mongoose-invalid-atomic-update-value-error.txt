*** mongo-mongoose-invalid-atomic-update-value-error ***

 I am trying to write to write an update to a Mongo document using the Mongoose findOneAndUpdate function. Essentially, I have a document that has an array of another Schema in it, and when I attempt to append more of those schema type, I get the following error: 
 
 I'm having a hard time figuring out what this error even means, much less what its source is.  
 The data I'm attempting to update is as follows:

 @Magrelo and @plus led me to an answer that worked. Something like:

 Another thing to check is if you are sending passing an array of changes to $set.  The error message that I received when calling something like this: 
 
 Gave me the [Error: Invalid atomic update value for $set. Expected an object, received object] 
 Changing it to an object worked.
