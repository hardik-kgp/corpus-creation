*** mongodb-aggregation-group-all-records-into-a-single-result ***

 In a mongodb aggregation call, how do I use the $group operator to group all documents in the pipeline into a single result? 
 Let's say I have a collection of records that look like this: 
 
 I want to use the aggregate function to query the database for a list of users who signed up in a given date range, and return it as a list. I'd like a result that looks like this: 
 
 My query looks something like this: 
 
 So far, so good. I now have a subset of records, all of which have a signup date in the desired range. But here's where I get into trouble. Now I want to group ALL those records into a single result containing a list of all the IDs. But I don't know how to do that using $group. 
 
 When I tried _id: null, I got back an empty list of user IDs. 
 I could just return the desired set of records using find(), and then just process the IDs into a list manually, but doing it using aggregate() seems cleaner. Am I wrong about that? What would be the best way to accomplish what I'm describing, either using aggregate or not? 
 
 Try this query:
