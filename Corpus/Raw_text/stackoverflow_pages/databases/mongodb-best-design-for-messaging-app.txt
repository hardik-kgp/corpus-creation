 A very simple design problem. Say I want to build Facebook Messenger. Let's say John and Marry are chatting, which is a better approach?  
 1)  **1 document per conversation**
,   is an array of message object 
 
 2)  **1 document per message**

 
 Which approach has better performance in terms of inserting a new message (updating a conversation vs. creating a new document) ? 
 or are there any better approach (as in my 2nd approach, i'm not sure if it's a good design to specify the participants field in each document)? 
 Thanks! 
 
 Based on your example data for the messaging app, what you could do is having two collections: Conversation and Messages. 
Where the relationship is one Conversation have many Messages. 
 
 Creating a new document message would be better in this case, as you can then have two applications (1 for john and 1 for marry) without handling the possibility of the two of them updating the same document.
They just happens to be sharing the same conversation session.  
 Also, if a conversation is a single document, you might end up with a very large document. (Document growth concern) 
 You can find out more about data modelling for this mongodb doc

 Also see  MongoDB: Socialite  for examples/discussion for social network use case.  
 Hope it helps. 
Cheers.
