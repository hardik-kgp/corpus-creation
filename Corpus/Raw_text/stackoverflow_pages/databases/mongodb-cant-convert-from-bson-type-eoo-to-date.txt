*** mongodb-cant-convert-from-bson-type-eoo-to-date ***

 I' trying to use aggregation framework (with ruby) and project the date  like this: 
 
 the document is like this one: 
 
 but i get the following error: 
 
 This is strange because it works correctly if I run this on the exactly same db which is imported with mongorestore. 
 
 The problem was that I was saving some documents without the timestamp field. 
 
 If you needed to have some documents without this timestamp field, you could try this (I'm using Javascript/Mongoose notation): 
 
 In this case, every document without the timestamp field would return -1. All the other documents would return the year as expected.
