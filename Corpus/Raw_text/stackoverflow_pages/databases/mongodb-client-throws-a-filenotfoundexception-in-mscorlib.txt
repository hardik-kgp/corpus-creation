*** mongodb-client-throws-a-filenotfoundexception-in-mscorlib ***

 I'm using Visual Studio .NET 4.6 and  Robomongo  has no problem connecting to my database 
 My imports for  MongoDB 
 
 The code that's executing: 
 
 The full error message: 
 
 An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException'
  occurred in mscorlib.dll 
 Additional information: Could not load file or assembly
  'System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation, Version=4.0.0.0,
  Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its
  dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. 
 
 
 Install the missing package. Using Package-installer, issue following command: 
 Install-Package System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation 
 
 I had the same problem here. The fix is pretty simple: edit the config file and on the node "dependentAssembly" where name attribute is "System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation", just remove the publicKeyToken attribute. 
 Good Luck 
 
 In my case I already had System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation installed, yet it kept giving me the same error.   Either complaining that 4.0.0.0 was not found, or if I updated the app.config to 4.3, it complained that 4.3.0.0 was missing. 
 However, after uninstalling and reinstalleding several packages it started working, and even though version 4.3 of the System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation was installed, it required the app.config to have 4.0.1.0 
 
 I have no idea why, but it finally works for me. 
 
 After much experimentation, it seems  **web.config**
 needs the following to work: 
 
 Whatever redirects NuGet was putting there were incorrect. This maybe isn't a MongoDB issue per se, perhaps issue with Microsoft Nuget packages/version stamps. 
 
 In my case, the package was already installed. However, there was a mismatch of the versions in the   file. A reinstall of the package fixed the issue. Open your Package Manager Console and type in, 
 
 
 I had the same problem here. It took a few minutes do find out that my problem was the fact that I have updated the nuget package "System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation", and it seems that MongoDb csharp's driver reference's has SpecificVersion = true. 
 Remove all nuget packages and install it again , or just downgrade it to the same version that it's installed as a MongoDb driver dependency. 
 Good luck! 
 
 It looks crazy, but.
I got this problem in Windows Server 2012 R2. 
 Only installation latest updates did help.
It was "2018-12 Security and Quality Rollup for .NET  for Windows..." (KB4471989).
