 Here is my   file: 
 
 Here is my   service command: 
 
 I have installed MongoDB about a week ago and it all worked fine, however today when I ran   command I got the following error: 
 
 **How can I fix that?**
  I use Windows 8.1 
 **Solution:**

 I forgot to start mongodb service with this command: 
 
 **Improved solution:**

 **1)**
 Change directory to root drive  , and type the command below into an admin   prompt window, 
 
 **2)**
 Then type   after which you should see the following message: 
 
 **3)**
 Then go to the control panel  , scroll down to MongoDB in the list of services and change start up type to automatic, if you so desire. Press OK. 
 **4)**
 Finally type   and you should be connected to the Mongo test DB.

 This is how I solved it, You can follow step by step here:  
 MongoDB Steps: 
 
 Download the latest 64-bit MSI version of  MongoDB  for Windows.  
 Run the installer (.msi file)  
 Add it to your  **PATH**
 of environment variables. it Should be from: 
 
 
 now Create a “\data\db” folder in  **C:/**
 which is used by  mongodb  to store all data. You should have this folder:  
 C:\data\db 
 
 Note: This is the default directory location expected by mongoDB,
  don’t create anywhere else 
 
 .  
 Finally, open command prompt and type: 
 
 You should see it asking for permissions (allow it) and then listen to a port. 
After that is done, open another command prompt, leaving the previous one running the server. 
 Type in the new command prompt 
 
 You should see it display the  version and connect to a test database. 
 This proves successful install!=)

 When you typed in the mongod command, did you also give it a path? This is usually the issue. You don't have to bother with the conf file. simply type  
 mongod --dbpath="put your path to where you want it to save the working area for your database here!! without these silly quotations marks I may also add!" 
 example: mongod --dbpath=C:/Users/kyles2/Desktop/DEV/mongodb/data 
 That is my path and don't forget if on windows to flip the slashes forward if you copied it from the or it won't work! 
 
 I was also faced the same issue with mongodb 2.6. 
 What solved my problem was I just run   command 
 and then start  
 It's worked for me 
 
 mongodb 2.6.8 on windows7 32bits
you only need create a folder c:/data/db
execute mongod, and execute mongo 
 
 Point to your mongodb instalation e.g C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Serve\bin and run mongod.exe so you can open connection to 127.0.0.1:27017. 
 
 just create a folder    
 
 Run below commands in command prompt 
 
 Open another command prompt 
 
 
 Normal case, you need at least 3379 MB of disk space. If you do not have; 
 
 This is not the only requirement. But this may be your problem. 
 
 The problem is that I missed out 'db' folder for the dbpath in the command: 
 
 
 If it writes that you had not properly shut down or that mongod.lock is not empty
, only delete mongod.lock from C:\data\db\ and it will start. 
 
 What solved my issue was creating a file startmongo.conf that sets the bind_ip to 127.0.0.1 . After that, I just created a *.bat to start the mongo using something like: 
 
 
 When This Error is Coming it is  lack of the following  
 1)Setting the path to mongo db 
go to "C" Drive and the installation of Mongo db directory and then go to bin folder in the mongo and copy the path of it  
 
 c:/mongodb/server/3.2/bin/ and create a new environmental variable in system properties then name is path and value="c:/mongodb/server/3.2/bin/" here my version is 3.2 
 
 2)create a data directory for the data in C Drive
c:/Data/twitter 
 3)start the server with ** 
 
 c:/> mongod  
 
 check your port config if there is any error as the local port may be assigned to any other
4)start your Mongo database with 
 
 Mongo
  then your mongo db will start 
 
 then in your mongo database 
 **create a database**

 
 use DATABASE_NAME 
 
 for example: 
 use twitterdata 
 switched to db twitterdata 
 to check your current database 
 
 db 
 
 twitterdata 
 to get total databases 
 
 show dbs 
 
 
 I started mongod in cmd,It threw error like C:\data\db\ not found.
Created folder then typed mongod
opened another cmd typed mongo it worked. 
 
 Here are the steps to solve this issue: 
 
 Just go to your MongoDB bin folder and run the mongod.exe file. 
 Navigate to your mongodb bin folder via Command prompt and start mongo by typing "mongo" 
 
 
 Change file permission to 755 for the file: 
 
 
 first you run the command mongod and check weather the port 27017 has started or not if yes then hit the command mongo....and database will start. 
 
 The Port is  not open. Thats why the machine refuses communication 
 
 Try this, it worked for me.
