*** mongodb-failed-to-connect-to-127-0-0-127017-reason-errno61-connection-refu ***

 My problem is similar to other inputs and suggestions on this site, but none has helped me. After installing MongoDB, has not started because the database is not running. 
 First try to run mongo and I answered this: 
 
 Then try to check the mongod and I answered this:  
 
 Then try again to connect and spend some time, and again says the same:  
 
 And so on. If you can help would greatly appreciate it. 
 
 PS: There is already the / data / db with 777 permissions, and I'm
  using OSX Mavericks 10.9.5 
 
 
 Are you running all of these commands in the same terminal as separate actions as your timestamps suggest? (if not, I would expect to see overlap between the failures and logs in order to diagnose properly). 
 If so, then what you are doing is as follows: 
 
 Starting a shell, attempting to connect to a non-running database (connection refused) 
 Starting the database, seeing 0 connections in the logs 
 Stopping the database (Ctrl-C or similar), starting a shell, fails to connect again because database has been shut down 
 Starting the database, seeing 0 connections in logs 
 repeat 
 
 The database needs to be running concurrently with the shell so you can connect to it.  Hence you should start the   process in one terminal, leave it running, and then open a new terminal (or tab) and run the   command to connect to the still running database.  The other option is to  run   as a daemon , which will allow you to run the   command in the same terminal once it returns. 
 Note: you should never have a folder with 777 permissions, it is not required and is a significant security risk. 
 
 Just try this command. 
 sudo chown mongodb /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock 
 And 
 sudo service mongod restart 
 
 
 Fixed! 
 
 The reason was the dbpath variable in /etc/mongodb.conf. Previously, I was using mongodb 1.8, where the default value for dbpath was /data/db. The upstart job mongodb(which comes with mongodb-10gen package) invokes the mongod with --config /etc/mongodb.conf option. 
 As a solution, I only had to change the owner of the /data/db directory recursively. 
 Like this:  **Go to**
 "/data"  **location in the terminal**
 and then type  
 
 For example: 
 
 
 Hello just check  if you created the /data/db path and if you did then give 755 permission with chmod.
