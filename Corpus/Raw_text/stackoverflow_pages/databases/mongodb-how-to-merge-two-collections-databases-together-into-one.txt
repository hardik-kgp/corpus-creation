*** mongodb-how-to-merge-two-collections-databases-together-into-one ***

 First please note this question is different from the following two 
 MongoDB: Combine data from multiple collections into one..how? 
 Merging two collections in MongoDB 
 MongoDB and "joins" 
 I will explain as follows: 
 I have two databases named:   and   in my mongodb.  
 Each database has one collection with same name called  .  
 Both collections have lots lots of docs that have exactly the same structure {key:"key1", value:"value1"}, etc. 
 Actually, I was supposed to only create   and insert all docs into  . But later when I did my second round of inserting, I made a mistake by typing the wrong name as the database name. 
 So now, each database has size of 32GB, I wish to merge two databases. 
 One problem/constraint is that the free space available now is only 15GB, so I can't just   all things from   to  .  
 I am wondering whether I can do  ? or what is the simplest / best /  **fast**
 way to merge the two simple databases? I prefer the most efficient way as simply reinserting 32GB into   will take quite a time. 
 
 I think the easiest (and maybe the only) way is to write a script that merges the two databases document after document. 
 
 Get first document from DB_B. 
 Insert it into DB_A if needed. 
 Delete it from DB_B. 
 Repeat until done. 
 
 Instead of deleting documents from source db (DB_B), you may want to just read documents in batches. This should be more performant, but slightly more difficult to code (especially if you never done such a thing).
