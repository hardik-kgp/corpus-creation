*** mongodb-querying-documents-with-two-equal-fields-match-and-eq ***

 What is the best way to return all documents in a collection if I want document.a == document.b? 
 I've tried  
 
 But it returns with no errors or results, because I assume it is literally matching strings "$a" and "$b".  Is there a different way to specify that these are fields? 
 
 The above works, but requires the additional step of querying again with whatever documents it found or projecting all possible fields. 
 Is there a better way for achieving this query? 
 
 Basically, you are trying to perform a self join. An operation not supported by MongoDB. 
 Concerning the   operator, as you guessed: 
 
 By design, the   comparison query operator  match a field against a  value . 
 But the   comparison aggregation operator  compare the value of two  expressions . 
 
 I don't know any other way to perform what you need than using an extra   step as you suggested. 
 Please note this is not  significantly  more expensive as, anyway, your query cannot use any index and MongoDB will do a full scan. 
 
 If I understood your question right you want those documents that have same values in field1 and field2. 
 For this try 
 
 or more compact
