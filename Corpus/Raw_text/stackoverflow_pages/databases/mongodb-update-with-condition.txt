 According to  https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update-field/  there is no   operator for update. 
 What are my options here to execute this update as a single command? 
 
 You can't. 
 Mongo doesn't support combining fields, conditionals etc. in the update statement. 
 
 You can update MongoDB document conditionally using  findAndModify()  or  findOneAndUpdate()  if you have MongoDB version 3.2+ 
 
 Starting  ,   can accept an aggregation pipeline, finally allowing the update/creation of a field based on another field: 
 
 
 The first part   is the match query, filtering which documents to update (in our case all documents). 
 The second part   is the update aggregation pipeline (note the squared brackets signifying the use of an aggregation pipeline).   is a new aggregation operator and an alias of  . Then any aggregation operator can be used within the   stage; in our case a conditional equality check on which depends the value to use for the new   field. 
 Don't forget  , otherwise only the first matching document will be updated. 
 
 
 Of course you can....
by running 2 queries 
 
 for your example case
