*** most-executed-stored-procedure ***

 We created so many inefficient stored procedure in our application, we always postpone to make it more efficient until we have serious problem with database performance. 
 Now, I am thinking to fix it one by one order by most often executed stored procedure. 
 What is the best way to figure out which stored procedure is the most executed? 
 Is there a script that can show which stored procedure is the most executed? 
 
 Use: 
 
 Reference:  SQL SERVER – 2005 – Find Highest / Most Used Stored Procedure 
 
 A quick way to accomplish this is to run SQL Profiler, and then "group" your trace by TextData. 
 
 Go into your Trace Properties  
 Under the Events Selection tab, click
on Organize Columns...   
 Click on TextData, and move it up to
the "Groups" area. 
 
 You may also only want to watch specific events, like SQL Batch Completed.  If I remember, that will give you durations and other handy stats to group/filter by. 
 
 Another fantastic tool is Microsoft's Performance Dashboard.  link text 
 
 Typical situation.. 
 Run the performance analyzer
And then start your application
set some filters to capture high number of reads/writes/scans etc..
