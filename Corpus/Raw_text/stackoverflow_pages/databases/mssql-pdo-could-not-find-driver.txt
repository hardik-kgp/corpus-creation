*** mssql-pdo-could-not-find-driver ***

 I'm using PHP Version 5.3.8 that was installed via XAMPP along with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (SQLEXPRESS). I have the drivers installed correctly (i guess) and have added the correct line into php.ini (extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv_53_ts_vc9.dll to be exact). 
 I'm trying to connect to the server like so: 
 
 I get the "could not find driver" error, and I've tweaked it all kinds of ways to solve the problem. I've tried all other kinds of drivers, but this is the only one that Apache doesn't give me an error on startup. When I run phpinfo(), the pdo_sqlsrv fields are all blank except pdo_sqlsrv.log_severity which is set to 0. 
 I DL'd my drivers from  microsoft , and I've tried both 2.0 and 3.0 
 Any advice would be awesome!!  
 
  is the old way of doing it,   should be more appropriate! In fact the extension is called (extension=php_pdo_ **sqlsrv**
_53_ts_vc9.dll) as well ;) 
 
 Hope this helps!

 Not sure if this is due to running a CentOS x86_64 machine but   didn't work as the driver for me, I had to use  :
