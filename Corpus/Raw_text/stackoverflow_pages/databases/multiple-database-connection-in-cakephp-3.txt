 You can declare the   method on the tables that will use by default another connection. In any of your Table classes: 
 
 
 **I get a solution of my problem. And it's working good. Please refer the below code and comment if I am wrong at any place.**

 add this line to your controller 
 
 
 use Cake\Datasource\ConnectionManager; 
 
 my  **TodolistsController.php**
 code is: 
 
 -->  **TodolistsTable.php**

 
 That's it.

 To switch the database for the model, 
 Use the namespace in the controller/model 
 
 In controller;- 
 
 In model:- 
 
 
 Note:- If you are saving data for the associated tables too, then keep
  in mind to change the DB for the associated data otherwise data for
  the associated table will be inserted into the default connection/DB. 
 
 This is the answer for CakePHP 3.* 
 
 You can have a try with useDbConfig model property if it works for you. 
 
class Example extends AppModel {
    public $useDbConfig = 'default1DbConfigSettings'; //The useDbConfig property is defaulted to the ‘default’ database connection.
}
