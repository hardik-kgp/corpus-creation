 I have two databases and two models:the Admin and the user. 
 I want to sync my models to the two databases;
admin model to database A and user model to database B; 
 If I am setting the model path to   and  , the two models will sync to the default database. 
 if I set the database in the   command such as  , and the two models will sync to database B. 
 So my problem is, how do I sync the two models to two databases? 
 
 I fully agree with @alecxe on using the database router.  I am currently using a single admin interface to manage multiple databases.  Note that authentication for all databases are stored in the default database, so when you do the   (with no arguments). 
 **Generic Database Router**
  
 I found  this  implementation to be extremely flexible and useful. 
 **Settings.py**
  
 
 **Sample Models**
  
 
 
 In order to define specific databases used for specific models, you need to define a  database router : 
 
 The easiest way to use multiple databases is to set up a database
  routing scheme. The default routing scheme ensures that objects remain
  ‘sticky’ to their original database (i.e., an object retrieved from
  the foo database will be saved on the same database). The default
  routing scheme ensures that if a database isn’t specified, all queries
  fall back to the default database.
