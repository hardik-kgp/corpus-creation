 I am working on app in which I would like to use two sqlite database in single app. Is this possible? Any help will be appreciated. 
 
 It is possible to have multiple databases in a single app. If you can do without multiple databases, you can have just a single database with multiple tables. You can use adb to view the databases and execute queries against them
