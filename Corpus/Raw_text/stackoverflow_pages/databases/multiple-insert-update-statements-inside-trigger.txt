*** multiple-insert-update-statements-inside-trigger ***

 Just a quick question that no doubt someone out there will know the answer to. 
 I need to be able to do multiple insert/updates within a trigger. Every attempt ends with failure :( 
 
 At the moment, the above simply inserts a row into a table when the parent table inserts. This works fine. 
 To get this to work with mulitple values I need to do  
 
 But... There must be an easier way? When I try using ; to terminate each statement, it fails with  
 
 I can't even get multiple update statements to work. 
 It'd be a great help if anyone could point out what i'm doing wrong? 
 Cheers

 From the docs:   Create Trigger Syntax 
 
 trigger_stmt is the statement to
  execute when the trigger activates. If
  you want to execute multiple
  statements, use the BEGIN ... END 
  compound statement construct. This
  also enables you to use the same
  statements that are allowable within
  stored routines
