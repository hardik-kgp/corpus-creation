*** multiple-instances-of-a-leveldb-database-at-the-same-time ***

 Is there a way to access a levelDB database from several programs? Is there some kind of option to open the dababase as read only? 
 For now, when opening the same database from to programs I get: 
 
 Cheers! 
 
 Unfortunately, LevelDB is designed that way and it doesn't allow more than a single instance of the database to be open. All of the options are for a single process, but if you have multiple threads then you can get a snapshot and iterate over it in read-only mode (allowing other threads to read/write to the underlying database at the same time). 
 Do you want to achieve a specific behavior? If so, let us know what it is and we might be able to help. 
 
 I was able to do this in linux by having each process make a directory of its own (e.g. $HOME/.leveldb/myprogram_myPID) and then do: 
 
 Then $HOME/.leveldb/myprogram_myPID can be used as a read-only leveldb database and multiple instances of the process can do this at the same time without copying the entire database.  
 It's probably wise to use a snapshot to access the db after doing this to avoid accidentally writing. Also, remember to delete the new directory when the process ends. 
 
 If you only need  **read-only access**
, each process can create a  **copy of the LevelDB folder**
: 
 
 Then, instead of using the original  , use  .
 
When the program is finished, the copy can be deleted safely.
