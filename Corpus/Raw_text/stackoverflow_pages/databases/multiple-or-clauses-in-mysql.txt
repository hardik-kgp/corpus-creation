 I'm trying to grab content where id = 3 OR id = 9 OR id = 100... Keep in mind, I can have a few hundred of these ids.   
 What is the most efficient way to write my query? 
 
 
 
 
 You may want to use the   function: 
 
 The   function syntax: 
 
 
 Check whether a value is within a set of values
  ... 
 Returns   if   is equal to any of the values in the   list, else returns  . 
 
 
 
 And call only the columns you need rather than using  ! 
 
 You can use SQL IN condition 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 $sql = "SELECT name FROM artists WHERE id REGEXP  regex-pattern "
