*** multiplicity-vs-cardinality ***

 When talking about data models and databases, the term  **Cardinality**
 is often used to describe the number of allowed elements in a given set.  
 UML often refers to the same property as  **Multiplicity**
. 
 Is there any differences between these two terms or are they synonymous? 
 
 The simplest explanation would be to say: 
Multiplicity = Cardinality + Participation  
 Cardinality: Denotes the maximum number of possible relationship
occurrences in which a certain entity can participate in (in simple terms: at most). 
 Participation: Denotes if all or only some entity occurrences participate in a relationship (in simple terms: at least).

 Martin Fowler has talked about this subject on his website. Quoting : 
 
 When data modeling methods talk about relationships, they use the term
  cardinality to indicate how many entities may be linked together. So
  you might have a relationship between order and customer and say that
  the cardinality of the relationship is one-to-many. Or you might hear
  that the cardinality of customers for an order is 0-to-many. 
 UML avoids the term cardinality preferring to use multiplicity. Often
  people with a data modeling background are surprised at this since
  cardinality has been so widely used in data modeling circles. 
 The reason for the change is that the dictionary definition of
  cardinality is "the number of elements in a particular set or other
  grouping" (OED). According to this the data modeling usage is actually
  wrong. In the excellent UML Reference Manual, Rumbaugh defines
  multiplicity as "A specification of the range of allowable cardinality
  values - the size - that a set may assume". The UML uses multiplicity
  in various places, for a property (association or attribute) and also
  to show the multiplicity of parts in a composite structure. It's
  formally defined as a lower and upper bound. An association (the UML
  equivalent to a relationship in data modeling circles) has a
  multiplicity for each direction.

 Simply put: a  multiplicity  is made up of a lower and an upper  cardinality . A cardinality is how many elements are in a set. Thus, a multiplicity tells you the minimum and maximum allowed members of the set. They are not synonymous. 
 
 Thank you for the question and answers above.  
 Really got confused with those terms this morning (coffee did not help).  
 Given the example below: 
 
 0-1 ---------- 1-* 
 
 Multiplicities: 
 
 **First multiplicity**
, for the  **left entity**
: 0-1  
 **Second multiplicity**
, for the  **right entity**
: 1-* 
 
 Cardinalities for the  **first multiplicity**
: 
 
 **Lower**
 cardinality: 0 
 **Upper**
 cardinality: 1 
 
 Cardinalities for the  **second multiplicity**
: 
 
 **Lower**
 cardinality: 1 
 **Upper**
 cardinality: * 
 
 
 The  **Multiplicity**
 is the constraint on the collection of the association objects whereas the  **Cardinality**
 is the count of the objects that are in collection. 
 The multiplicity is actually the constraint on cardinality.
