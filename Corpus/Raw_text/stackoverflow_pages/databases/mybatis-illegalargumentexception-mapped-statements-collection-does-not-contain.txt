 i have many problem with spring e mybatis. This is my spring configuration:
i have the same configuration and ComuneMapper.java and ComuneMapper.xml stay in the same folders. but i have however this error
Somebody to help meeeee 
 
 jdbc-context.xm: 
 
 sqlmap-config.xml: 
 
 controller: 
 
 this is the error: 
 
 please!!! someone help me I'm hopeless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I had forgotten.
this is ComuniMapper.java 
 
 end this ComuniMapper.xml: 
 
 
 **There can be several reasons...!**

 
 -> SQL Syntax (maybe a single small query has an extra "," at the end of the select)  
 -> Classpath issues ,cannot resolve jar dependencies 
 -> Also this can coming due an file encoding issue or illegal xml characters embed in your '*Mapper.xml' file. (so watch out for your editor..!) 
 
 **most importantly you should use same names for.**

 
 interface = xxx.yyy.mappers.SettingMapper.class  
 mapper file = /xxx/yyy/mappers/SettingMapper.xml  
 mapper namespace = xxx.yyy.mappers.SettingMapper  
 
 
 Hi this problem usually is connected to mapper locations.
So try to set the mapperLocation property in your  SqlSessionFactory  bean: 
 
 Hope it help! 
 
 This usually means mybatis can't find the mapping you refer to. Perhaps you forgot to add the *Mapper.xml file to  **mybatis-config.xml**
 (which is a standard config file for MyBatis) 
 
 See more in documentation  http://mybatis.github.io/mybatis-3/configuration.html#mappers 
 
 In My case what happened is there were was a  **TYPO in my method name**
 in the mapping xml file.
 When I have changed the DAO name, I forgot to change in the xml, it may help someone else. 
 
 Adding to the other answers, you also have to 
 
 **Check for duplicate method names**

 
 This error comes in the log at last. 
 
 Ignore the above message and simply move up your logs and look for the first error message in the logs. The first error I got was,  
 
 The error clearly points out that, the method   already exists in the   interface(with different number of parameters). Duplicating the method names also throws this error. (The penalty for copy-pasting codes) :P 
 
 Duplicated   in mapper.xml also throws such exception.
Hope this helps. 
 
 I also encountered this problem. In addition to the possibility of the above answer I try to use this way which solve the problem: 
 The method name should be same in   and  , in my case method name not is same. So you must be sure that they are the same. 
 Good luck! 
 
 you may register your mapper in   file 
 
 
 I'm using mybatis the same way as you. Your code looks fine. Even I'm not sure if there is a problem with type mappings. Try two following tips to fix your problem: 
 
 change java type to mybtis aliases
a) "java.lang.Long" -> "long", b) "com.aieap.model.Comuni" -> "comuni" 
 try to add alias instead of XML mapping
@org.apache.ibatis.type.Alias("comuni") to com.aieap.model.Comuni, remove xml typeAlias, add spring configuration to your org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean:  
 
 Good luck,
Martin 
 
 I had similar problem. Then I found that all requests who has the query mappings defined on that mapper.xml having same error.  
 May be this is because of improper build of WAR or improper deployment to server.
Anyway, I deleted that WAR file and re-deployed again and it worked! 
 
 I came across this exception too. In my case the mapper xml file was present in a JAR included in the classpath, but somehow it could not be found by the MapperScannerConfigurer. I came to know of this by reading the logs. You should read the logs and check the line of the following format to know whether there are any mappers being found. I had to give the root path to it, after which it found my mapper.  
 
 
 Check if you have mapped   in the properties file.  
 add this line in application.properties file.
