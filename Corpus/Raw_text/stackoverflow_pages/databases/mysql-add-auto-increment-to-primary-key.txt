*** mysql-add-auto-increment-to-primary-key ***

 I have a strange problem with mysql. 
 I am trying to alter a table's column which is a primary key and has an auto_increment constraint defined on it. This is also a foreign key reference for multiple other tables. 
I need to change the length of this column in both , parent and all children. 
 
 This removes the auto increment on the parent table. What would be the best way to add the constraint back ? 
 The below seems to be failing. 
 
 Is there a better way to achieve this ? 
 Edit : Show create is (after alter) :  
 
 before alter 
 
 Thanks! 
 
 You don't need to specify   in the MODIFY statement:
