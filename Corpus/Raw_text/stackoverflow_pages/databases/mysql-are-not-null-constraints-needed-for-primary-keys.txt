*** mysql-are-not-null-constraints-needed-for-primary-keys ***

 is it necessary to declare "NOT NULL" constraints for primary keys in the MySQL database?  A primary key cannot have NULL values because it auto_increments anyway and automatically fills the field record. So am I correct in saying this mean I can remove the "NOT NULL" constraint for my primary keys? 
 
 (As you've tagged your question  .)  In MySQL, you don't have to do it explicitly. From  the manual : 
 
 A   is a unique index where all key columns must be defined as  . If they are not explicitly declared as  , MySQL declares them so implicitly (and silently).  
 
 Of course, just because you don't  have  to doesn't mean you might not want to for clarity, etc. 
 
 Yes and no
You can remove "Not null", that won't remove the constraint though. Personally I'd leave them in, you gain nothing worthwhile from taking them out. 
 
 Primary key must not include nullable columns.   is not a check constraint, (it is rather a default constraint) , so you cannot remove   from definition of the column that is part of primary key regardless of presence of  . You don't have to type   while creating the table for primary key in mysql, because the engine adds this constraint automatically.  
 
 WE need not declare explicitly the column as not null because Primary key constraint makes the column NOT NULL. I have checked in Oracle.
