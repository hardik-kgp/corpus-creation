*** mysql-check-if-a-table-exists-without-throwing-an-exception ***

 What is the best way to check if a table exists in MySQL (preferably via PDO in PHP) without throwing an exception. I do not feel like parsing the results of "SHOW TABLES LIKE" et cetera. There must be some sort of boolean query? 
 
 I don't know the PDO syntax for it, but this seems pretty straight-forward: 
 
 
 If you're using MySQL 5.0 and later, you could try: 
 
 Any results indicate the table exists.

 Using mysqli i've created following function. Asuming you have an mysqli instance called $con. 
 
 Hope it helps. 
 **Warning:**
 as sugested by @jcaron this function could be vulnerable to sqlinjection attacs, so make sure your   var is clean or even better use parameterised queries. 
 
 This is posted simply if anyone comes looking for this question. Even though its been answered a bit. Some of the replies make it more complex than it needed to be. 
 For mysql* I used : 
 
 In PDO I used: 
 
 With this I just push the else condition into or. And for my needs I only simply need die. Though you can set or to other things. Some might prefer the if/ else if/else. Which is then to remove or and then supply if/else if/else. 
 
 Here is the my solution that I prefer when using stored procedures. Custom mysql function for check the table exists in current database. 
 
 
 As a "Show tables" might be slow on larger databases, I recommend using "DESCRIBE " and check if you get true/false as a result

 If the reason for wanting to do this is is conditional table creation, then 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS'  seems ideal for the job. Until I discovered this, I used the 'DESCRIBE' method above. More info here:  MySQL "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" -> Error 1050 
 
 Why you make it so hard to understand?
