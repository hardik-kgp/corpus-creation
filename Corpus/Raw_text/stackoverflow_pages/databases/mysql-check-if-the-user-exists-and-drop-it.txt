*** mysql-check-if-the-user-exists-and-drop-it ***

 There’s not standard way to check if a MySQL user exists and based on that drop it. Are there any workarounds for this?   
 Edit:  I need a straight way to run this without throwing up an error 
e.g. 
 
 
 Since MySQL 5.7 you can do a

 This worked for me: 
 
 This creates the user if it doesn't already exist (and grants it a harmless privilege), then deletes it either way. Found solution here:  http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=19166 
 Updates:  @Hao recommends  adding  ; @andreb (in comments) suggests disabling  . 
 
 Found the answer to this from one of the MySQL forums. We’ll need to use a procedure to delete the user.   
 User here is “test” and “databaseName” the database name. 
  ;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS  .  ;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE  . ()
BEGIN
  DECLARE foo BIGINT DEFAULT 0 ;
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  INTO foo
    FROM  . 
      WHERE   = 'test' and    = 'localhost';
   IF foo > 0 THEN
         DROP USER 'test'@'localhost' ;
  END IF;
END ;$$
DELIMITER ;
CALL  . () ;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS  .  ;
SET SQL_MODE=@OLD_SQL_MODE ;

 CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'a';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES  ON databaseName.* TO 'test'@'localhost'
 WITH GRANT OPTION
 
 
 To phyzome's answer (most highly voted one), it seems to me that if you put "identified by" at the end of the grant statement, the user will be created automatically. But if you don't, the user is not created. The following code works for me, 
 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 
 that works for me without throwing any errors in Maria DB, it should work for u too 
 
 **Update:**

As of MySQL 5.7 you can use   statement.
Ref:  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/drop-user.html 
 
 Syntax:  
 Example:  
 
 FYI (and for older version of MySQL), this is a better solution...!!! 
 The following SP will help you to remove user   by executing  
 If you want to remove all users named   (say  ,   and  ) execute SP like   This will delete all users named  !!! seriously... 
 Now please have a look on mentioned SP  : 
 
 **Usage:**

  to remove user  
  to remove user  
  to remove all users named   (eg., say  ,   and  ) 
 
 Um... Why all the complications and tricks? 
 Rather then using DROP USER... You can simply delete the user from the mysql.user table (which doesn't throw an error if the user does not exist), and then flush privileges to apply the change.   
 
 -- UPDATE -- 
 I was wrong.  It's not safe to delete the user like that.  You do need to use DROP USER.  Since it is possible to have mysql options set to not create users automatically via grants (an option I use), I still wouldn't recommend that trick. Here's a snipet from a stored procedure that works for me: 
 
 
 Regarding @Cherian's answer, the following lines can be removed: 
 
 This was a bug pre 5.1.23.  After that version these are no longer required.  So, for copy/paste convenience, here is the same with the above lines removed.  Again, for example purposes "test" is the user and "databaseName" is the database; and this was from  this bug . 
 
 
 I wrote this procedure inspired by Cherian's answer.
The difference is that in my version the user name is an argument of the procedure ( and not hard coded ) . I'm also doing a much necessary FLUSH PRIVILEGES after dropping the user. 
 
 I also posted this code on the CodeReview website (  https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/15716/mysql-drop-user-if-exists  ) 
 
 
 The above command will drop the user from the database, however, it is  **Important**
 to know if the same user is already using the database, that session will not end until the user closes that session. It is important to note that dropped user will STILL access the database and perform any operations.
 DROPPING THE USER DOES NOT DROP THE CURRENT USER SESSION 
 
 Combining phyzome's answer (which didn't work right away for me) with andreb's comment (which explains why it didn't) I ended up with this seemingly working code that temporarily disables NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER mode if it is active: 
 
 
 in terminal do: 
 
 enter the password. 
 
 now delete the user 'the_username' 
 
 replace 'the_username' with the user that you want to delete. 
 
 In case you have a school server where the pupils worked a lot. You can just clean up the mess by: 
 
 
 If you mean you want to delete a drop from a table if it exists, you can use the   command, for example: 
 
 If no rows match, it's not an error.
