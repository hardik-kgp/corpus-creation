*** mysql-community-server-limitations ***

 Could anyone please tell what are the limitations to MySQL Community Server & the pros of a MySQL Enterprise Server? 
 The following would be our daily transactional activity with the DB 
 
 Atleast 10 million records would be created and updated on a person day basis. 
 Scheduled Procedures would be acting on the records in addition to the application accessing them. 
 
 I am concerned about the DB capacity (DB size threshold,etc) and if it would withstand huge volume of data when i opt for MySQL Community Server. 
 Thanks in Advance. 
 
 **Difference between MySQL CE and MySQL Enterprise edition?**
  
 Difference between the community edition and the enterprise edition is added support and tools. The server itself is the same, but the enterprise edition gets updated more frequently and it is stable with quick bug fix support.
It would be safe and will not make any problem if the decide to move on to ORACLE in future.

 **MySQL Community Server:**

 
 Freely available under the open source GPL license 
 In a MyISAM table with dynamic (variable length) rows, the index
file for the table (tablename.MYI) stores row locations using 32-bit
pointers into the data file (tablename.MYD). That means it can
address only 4GB of space.
