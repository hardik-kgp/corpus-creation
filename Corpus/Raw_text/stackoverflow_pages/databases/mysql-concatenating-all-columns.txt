*** mysql-concatenating-all-columns ***

 Why can we not concatenate in MySQL using the * keyword? 
 
 or  
 
 Is there any other way we could access values in a column without explicitly using the columns name? 
 
 To concatenate all columns in a table, you can't use the   keyword, but you need to explicitly list all columns: 
 
 or you might want to use   that will skip null values: 
 
 If you don't want to specify all column names manually, you could use a dinamic query. This query will return all column names of your table: 
 
 and using GROUP_CONCAT you can obtain a list of all column names: 
 
 quoted, in a comma separated format: 
 
 so now we have all the elements to create our query dinamically: 
 
 this query will set the @sql string to something like: 
 
 and this code will execute it:
