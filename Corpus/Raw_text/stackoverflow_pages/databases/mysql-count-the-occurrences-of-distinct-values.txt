 what about something like this : 
 
 ie, you are selecting the name and the number of times it appears ; but grouping by name so each name is selected only once. 
 Then, you order by number of times, desc ; to have the most frequently appearing users come first. 
 
 Just changed Amber's COUNT(*) to COUNT(1) for the better performance.
