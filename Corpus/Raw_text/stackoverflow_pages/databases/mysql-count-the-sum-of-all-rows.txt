*** mysql-count-the-sum-of-all-rows ***

 I have a mysql table that has a number of rows, and in each row a field called "value",
the field value will differ from row to row.
What I want, is to select all the rows and count the sum of all the "value" fields. 
 any idea?

 What you'll want is the  -function named  SUM . 
 
 This query will return the sum of   and the number of rows count:
