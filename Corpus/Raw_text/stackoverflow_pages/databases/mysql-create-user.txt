*** mysql-create-user ***

 I am logged into mysql... 
 
 And I have run the following command to remove the database user which worked succesfully 
 
 I can then add user successfully using the following command, again this works successfully 
 
 The above command create a user with the host as a wildcard (%) The issue I am having is if I was to create a user with the host being say localhost or an external IP i get the following error: 
 
 Any suggestions? 
 Thanks in advance 
 
 This is a bug reported here -  http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=28331 
 See if your user exists after you drop it.  
 
 Check following 2 tables if user is still there after DROP USER command:
mysql.user and mysql.db. 
 Delete user from both, then run FLUSH PRIVILEGES and then you can recreate the user. 
 
 drop user 'username@localhost
' 
 
 i will suggest you to use phpmyadmin its very esey do do with that. 
 steps: 
 
 open phpmyadmin 
 go to admin section 
 hit on add user account 
 put user name and password 
 set privileges 
 
 that's all

 You have to manualy remove records with from mysql.tables_priv also.
