*** mysql-database-automatic-partitioning ***

 I have a mysql database table that I want to partition by date, particularly by month & year. However, when new data is added for a new month, I don't want to need to manually update the database. 
 When I initially create my database, I have data in Nov 09, Dec 09, Jan 10, etc. Now when February starts, I'd like a Feb 10 partition automatically created. Is this possible? 
 
 There are a few solutions out there, if you want a total solution, check this  post out on kickingtyres .  It's a basic combination of a stored procedure handling the partition analysis and creation (with some logging!). 
 All you need to do is adjust it to your partition type  (the example uses a bigint partition) and schedule the procedure to run with the MySQL Event Scheduler. 
 
 yes, you might like the enhanced partitioning functionality in 5.5:

 I will do what the other done (post a link)  Quick Introdunction to MySQL Partitioning 
 (look at page 50 for what you need - partition by date)
Edit: I reread your post more carefully - if you want to change partitions by month why don't you create a Mysql   that does that
