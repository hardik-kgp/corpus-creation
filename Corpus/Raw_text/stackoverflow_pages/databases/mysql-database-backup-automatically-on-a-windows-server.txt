*** mysql-database-backup-automatically-on-a-windows-server ***

 Is there a way to back up MySQL database automatically at certain times of the day for designated servers or send an email with an attachment.. Which ever do you think is the best and safest way to achieve this? 
 
 I would use Windows Task Scehduler/cron (depending on your system) and  mysqldump . Scroll down in the link, it includes some insights how to achieve what you want. 
 
 Best way to do this would be  
 
 The pattern   will create a unique name ( ) each time it will run 
 Now you just need to call this command in your task scheduler. That's it. :) 
 
 You can add one of these commands to  : 
 
 or in a compact way: 
 
 or: 
 
 
 
 
 To create file whose name is based on the date and time, use   and  .
Note that the 2 variables are based on locale and cmd shell version 
 
 open the cmd windows 
 input   and  
mine is  , 
 substr the variable through  
I want the time delimited by comma, so the cmd goes
 
 to get a filename like  
use  
 check the   and   in advance 
 use the   option instead of  ; According to the Mysql Manuel, the charset of file saved using ">" is  , while the   follows the  
 save to file  
 add it to a new task   and set a trigger (Windows Task Scheduler) 
 
 
 I did the work, similar to what other people explained through...  **but with little difference and extra work**
: 
 1) I made a batch file  
2) Ran that batch file through windows scheduler  
3) Made appropriate schedule for that task  
4) Inside the batch file these steps are executed: 
 
 4-1) Prepared a file name based on current date 
 4-2) Got a backup by mysqldump.exe in the corresponding directory & file name 
 4-3) Made a compress file through 7-Zip app(install it) & then delete the uncompressed backup 
 4-4) Put a copy on our network File-Server 
 
 Here is a script(.bat) sample:
