*** mysql-database-got-error-28-from-storage-engine-while-accessing-from-webmin ***

 I am trying to access an MySQL database from the webmin console. But I'm unable to access the db, as it throws following error message: 
 
 How can I overcome this problem? 
 
 Check your disk space usage. 
 I also faced the same problem.  I fixed by moving files into another disk.   
 If you are using Linux OS.  You can check the disk usage by using the command: 
 
 And I moved some files from /dev/xvda1 ->  /dev/xvdb   partition. 
 And checked the disk usage.   
 
 Now MySQL server working fine.   
 
 Yes, it is a disk space problem, but it could by masquerade. I suggest open 2 consoles and run in one of them  
 watch -n1 "df -h"  
 and on the other try to reproduce the error, at the same time look at the first console.
In my case /tmp was at 35% (1G), it goes to 100%, and when the command finish went back to 35%. 
 
 Actually in my own case, It was a masquerade. I host the site with Siteground, and when I used their SuperCacher to flush the system, everything started working again.
I am just adding this answer for anyone in
