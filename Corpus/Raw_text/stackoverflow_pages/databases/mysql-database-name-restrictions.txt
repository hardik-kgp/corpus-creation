*** mysql-database-name-restrictions ***

 I am building a system where while the admin is installing it, one of the steps is to create a database (from the system). So my question is, how should I validate the database name? I found it can't be longer than 64 chars but is this the only restriction? I tested some db names with special characters in phpmyadmin which didn't give an error. 
 
 MySQL database naming restrictions: 
 
 Cannot be longer than 64 characters. 
 Cannot contain     or   characters. 
 Cannot contain characters that are not permitted in file names. 
 Cannot end with space characters.
