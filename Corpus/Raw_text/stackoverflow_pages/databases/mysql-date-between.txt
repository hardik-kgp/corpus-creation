 **Original Question:**

 Simple question but for some reason I cannot seem to get this working. 
 I have a search box, next to that is a date-range select menu, so the user can search for photos within the last 1 month, 6 months or 12 months. 
 What I have does not error but it produces no results when it should do, this is it: 
 
 The SQL output produces this: 
 
 The database 'dateCreated' field is set to (Date INDEX). 
 Can anybody see what is wrong? 
 
 The dates in your resulting SQL should be quoted with single quotes. Try surrounding the dynamic parts of your query with quotes. Something like this: 
 
 which I assume would produce this SQL: 
 
 Also, see if you can find a way to format the dates in the more usual MySQL   format. Like this: 
 
 
 If you are specifically looking backwards from "now", why not do 
 
 No need for a "Range", just insert the month range back you want to allow... 
 
  is not a proper date format and date values in MySQL should be always quoted alike strings and ISO 8601 ( ) format.   will be interpreted as just   divided by   and   which gives about  . 
 That is to say, your SQL should be like the following form instead: 
 
 
 Not sure what technology you're using for  , but your final date format is wrong in addition to the fact that your date values are not enclosed by single quotes. 
 MySQL compares dates as   not  . 
 A note that you can do this in MySQL with its  Date Time Functions . Although it  may  keep the query from being cached. 
 
 If those strings are unquoted, I believe you are actually just doing division and then comparing the dates between a very small timeframe.
