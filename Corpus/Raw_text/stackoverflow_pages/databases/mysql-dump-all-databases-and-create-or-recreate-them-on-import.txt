*** mysql-dump-all-databases-and-create-or-recreate-them-on-import ***

 I was wondering how I can get the following file, 
 
 to automatically create any databases that are not yet created, when imported. Also, if a database is already present, it should recreate it (overwriting the old one). 
 Is this possible? Thanks! 
 
 
 
 **Export:**

 
 Look up the documentation for mysqldump. You may want to use some of the options mentioned in comments: 
 
 **Import:**

 
 **I Just found a new solution:**

 Create a bash script. It backs up each database into a different file 
 
 
 do not use "mysql" command to export data. Please use "mysqldump" instead. 
 I have to administrate a server that saves only: 
 
 after executing "mysql --user=username --password=passord > somefile.sql" 
 
 /applications/MAMP/library/bin/mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > all_dbs.sql
