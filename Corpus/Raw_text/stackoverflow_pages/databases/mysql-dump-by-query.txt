*** mysql-dump-by-query ***

 Is it possible to do   by single  ? 
 I mean to dump the  **whole**
 database, like   does when you do export to  
 
 not mysqldump, but mysql cli... 
 
 you can redirect it out to a file if you want : 
 
 Update: 
Original post asked if he could dump from the database by query. What he asked and what he meant were different. He really wanted to just mysqldump all tables. 
 
 
 This should work 
 
 
 You can dump a query as csv like this: 
 
 
 Dump a table using a where query: 
 
 Dump an entire table: 
 
 Notes: 
 
 Replace  ,  , and the where statement with your desired values. 
 By default,   will include   and   statements in its output.  Therefore, if you wish to  **not delete all the data in your table**
 when restoring from the saved data file, make sure you use the   option. 
 You may need to add the appropriate  ,  , and   options to the example commands above in order to specify your desired database host, user, and password, respectively. 
 
 
 You could use --where option on mysqldump to produce an output that you are waiting for: 
 
 At most 100 rows from test.t1 will be dumped from database table.

 If you want to export your last n amount of records into a file, you can run the following: 
 
 The above will save the last 100 records into export_file.sql, assuming the table you're exporting from has an auto-incremented id column. 
 You will need to alter the user, localhost, database and table values. You may optionally alter the id column and export file name. 
 
 Combining much of above here is my real practical example, selecting records based on both  meterid & timestamp. I have needed this command for years. Executes really quickly. 
 
 
 MySQL Workbench also has this feature neatly in the GUI. Simply run a query, click the save icon next to Export/Import: 
 
 Then choose "SQL INSERT statements (*.sql)" in the list. 
 
 Enter a name, click save, confirm the table name and you will have your dump file.
