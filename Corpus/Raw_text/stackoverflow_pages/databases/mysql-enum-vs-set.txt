*** mysql-enum-vs-set ***

 For MySQL Data type of "enum" and "set" what are the differences and advantages and disadvantages of using one versus the other? 
 Example data type: 
 
 enum('A', 'B', 'C') 
 set('A', 'B', 'C') 
 
 The only difference that I am aware of is that ENUM only allows one value to be selected versus SET allows multiple values to be selected. 
 
 As the  MySQL documentation  states: 
 
 Definition of a ENUM or SET column does act as a constraint on values
  entered into the column. An error occurs for values that do not
  satisfy these conditions: 
 An ENUM value must be one of those listed in the column definition, or
  the internal numeric equivalent thereof. The value cannot be the error
  value (that is, 0 or the empty string). For a column defined as
  ENUM('a','b','c'), values such as '', 'd', or 'ax' are illegal and are
  rejected. 
 A SET value must be the empty string or a value consisting only of the
  values listed in the column definition separated by commas. For a
  column defined as SET('a','b','c'), values such as 'd' or 'a,b,c,d'
  are illegal and are rejected. 
 
 
 analogy: 
ENUM = radio fields (only accepted values are those listed, may only choose one) 
SET = checkbox fields (only accepted values are those listed, may choose multiple) 
 
 Enum and Set totally depends on requirements, like if you have a list of radio button where only one can be chosen at a time, use Enum. And if you have a list of checkbox  where at a time more then one item can be chosen, use set. 
 
 
 You can copy the code above and paste it in mysql, and you will find that  **SET**
 actually is a collection. You can store each combine of attributes you declare. 
 
 You can also copy the code above. And you will find that each  **ENUM**
 actually can only be store once each time. And you will find that the results of last 2 lines will both be empty.  
 
 Actually it's pretty simple: 
 When you define an  **ENUM('Yes', 'No', 'Maybe')**
 then you  **must**
 INSERT only one of these values (or their positional index number) 
 When you define a  **SET('R', 'W', 'X')**
 then you  **can**
 INSERT an empty string,  **or**
 one or more of these values. If you insert something that's not in the predefined set, an empty string is is inserted instead. Note that before inserting all duplicate values are discarded, so only one instance of each permitted value is being inserted.  
 Hope this clears it up. 
 Please note that Winbobob's answer is incorrect and  contains flawed examples, as when inserting multiple values, the values must be strings, separated with commas. All his inserts are actually inserting just a single value (and last two aren't in the defined set)
