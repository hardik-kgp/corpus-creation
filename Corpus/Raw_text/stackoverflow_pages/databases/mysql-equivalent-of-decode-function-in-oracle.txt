*** mysql-equivalent-of-decode-function-in-oracle ***

 I am trying to find an equivalent of DECODE function in MySQL. It works like this: 
 
 The DECODE function will compare value of column 'Age' with 13, 14, 15.. and return appropriate string value 'Thirteen', 'Fourteen'.. and if it matches with nothing, then default value of 'Adult' will be returned. 
 Any ideas which function in MySQL can do this job? Thanks. 
 CLARIFICATION: I agree using CASE is one way of achieving desired result, but I am rather looking for a  **function**
 because of performance and other reasons. 
 
 You can use   where in Oracle you would have used  .  
 
 
 You can use a  CASE  statement...however why don't you just create a table with an integer for ages between 0 and 150, a varchar for the written out age and then you can just join on that 
 
 
 
 Another MySQL option that may look more like Oracle's   is a combination of   and  . In the code that follows,   returns the argument list position of the string that matches Age.   returns the string from  s argument list at the position provided by  . For example, if   is  ,   returns   because   is the 2nd argument of   (not counting  ). Then,   returns  , which is the 2nd argument of   (not counting the   argument).   returns the default   if no match to   is found in the list. 
 
 While I don't think this is the best solution to the question either in terms of performance or readability it is interesting as an exploration of MySQL's string functions. Keep in mind that  's output does not seem to be case sensitive. I.e.,   and   both return  . 
 
 The example translates directly to: 
 
 which you may prefer to format e.g. like this: 
 
 
 If additional table doesn't fit, you can write your own function for translation. 
 The plus of sql function over case is, that you can use it in various places, and keep translation logic in one place. 
 
 you can use if() in place of decode() in mySql as follows 
  This query will print all even id row.
