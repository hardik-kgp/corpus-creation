*** mysql-error-the-maximum-column-size-is-767-bytes ***

 When I run a program which does something with MySQL, I got this error message: 
 
 2015-06-10 15:41:12,250 ERROR app.wsutils 419 INCRON: Error: ('HY000',
  '[HY000] [MySQL][ODBC 5.2(w) Driver][mysqld-5.7.7-rc-log]Index column
  size too large. The maximum column size is 767 bytes. (1709)
  (SQLExecDirectW)') 
 
 I Googled a little bit, and found this error might be relating to the   option. However, I am using MySQL 5.7.7 rc, which has already set   to be "ON" (checked in MySQL Workbench), allowing up to 3072 bytes. I am not sure if that is the problem with   or not. 
 Anyway, does anyone have an idea how to fix this problem? 
 
 With the help of the answer given by BK435, I did the following and solved the problem. 
 
 
 Your column that you are trying to index is too large and your settings must not be correct for  . There are a couple  prerequisites  parameters that also have to be set in order for   to work correctly. 
 You can check to make sure that  innodb_large_prefix  is set by running: 
 
 Here are a couple prerequisites for using innodb_large_prefix: 
 You need to set your global variable innodb_file_format= BARRACUDA 
 to check settings run:  
 At the table level you have to use ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC or ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED 
 for  Innodb , rows are stored in COMPACT format (ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT) by default.   
 
 I had the same error despite having   configured correctly. 
 The issue was in used collation. My db had default collation set to   (you can check it in phpmyadmin "Operations" tab for database). It means it uses 4 bytes per char, while utf8 collation (e.g. utf8_unicode_ci) uses 3 bytes per char. 
 in this case you can either use different collation e.g. by adding   at the end of the   statement, or limit the index size by using just a part of the column value 
like  .

 In my case (MySQL version 5.6) the issue was that I was trying to create a table with a column that can have up to 256 characters (the db uses utf8 collation), so 3 bytes per 1 utf8 character = 256*3=768 bytes. The fix was to simply have 255 characters instead of 256.  
 I could also set innodb_large_prefix, like others suggest, but in my case it was easier to just have fewer symbols. 
 
 I had this problem because I tried to create a String primary key with varchar(254). Easy to overlook sometimes.. So double check your index type and length as well :) 
 
 I was using MariaDB version 10.1.38 and used all of the below given commands but it did not work - 
 
 Because after you restart your MySQL (or MariaDB), these settings will not reflect back using the command at the mysql prompt: show variables like 'innodb%'; 
 **Then I edited My.ini and added these settings in the file at below location-
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini**

 Just add the following options to my.cnf 
 
 Then, restart mysql server the problem will be resolved. 
 
 I had the same error but on a different issue. I got this error while importing a data (data and schema) script. Deleting the Unique Index fixed the issue for me.

 Set the below system variables: 
 
 Also, make sure when you create your schema you create it as  **Latin1**
.  That is what finally fixed me.
