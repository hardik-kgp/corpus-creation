*** mysql-foreign-key-to-allow-null ***

 I'm piecing together an image website. The basic schema's pretty simple MySQL, but I'm having some trouble trying to represent possible admin flags associated with an image ("inappropriate", "copyrighted", etc.). My current notion is as follows: 
 
 (truncated for ease of reading; assorted foreign keys and indexes are in order, I swear) 
  is foreign-keyed on a lookup table of flag types, and as you can imagine    should  be foreign-keyed on  . The issue at hand is that, when a flag is first issued, there is no logical resolution type (I'd declare this a good use of  ); however, if a value is set, it should be foreign-keyed to the lookup table. 
 I can't find a MySQL syntax workaround to this situation. Does it exist? The best runners up are: 
 
 Add an "unmoderated" resolution type 
 Add a   entry to   (would this even work in an   column?) 
 
 Thanks for the insight! 
 PS Bonus points to whomever tells me whether, in the case of databases, it's "indexes" or "indices". 
 
 **Follow-up**
: thanks to Bill Karwin for pointing out what turned out to be a syntax error in the table structure (don't set a column to   if you want it to allow  !). And once I have enough karma to give you those bonus points, I will :) 
 
 You can solve this by allowing   in the foreign key column  .

 The plural of  index  should be  indexes . 
 According to " Modern American Usage " by Bryan A. Garner: 
 
 For ordinary purposes,  indexes  is
  the preferable plural, not  indices .
  ...
   Indices , though less pretentious than  fora  or  dogmata , 
  is pretentious nevertheless.
  Some writers prefer  indices  in
  technical contexts, as in mathematics
  and the sciences.  Though not the best
  plural for  index ,  indices  is
  permissible in the sense "indicators."
  ...
  Avoid the singular  indice , a back-formation from the plural  indices .
