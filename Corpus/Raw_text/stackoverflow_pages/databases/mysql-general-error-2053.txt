*** mysql-general-error-2053 ***

 I'm getting the error: 
 
 ERROR: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2053 
 
 I have no idea why this is happening because the code works fine and the database is updated, but it still returns this error. 
 Here's my code: 
 
 
  is the line that will cause your error. 
 Why? 
 Because there's nothing to fetch - in array - after an update 
 Remember that 
 
 PDO::FETCH_ASSOC: returns an array indexed by column name as returned
  in your result set 
 
 So, no result set ... no party 
 If you want to know exit status of your command, just use the return value of   function
