*** mysql-how-to-make-null-or-empty-data-default-to-0-during-insert ***

 So this seems like it would be pretty straight forward and I swear I've done this before, but for some reason it's just not working for me. 
 I am using   and have a table with about 200 columns and I want about 20 of them to default to 0 if NULL or empty data is inserted into it. 
 Here's a small example of what my table looks like as well as what I have done for columns that I want to default to 0. 
 
 So notice on   I have it set to   the problem is that when empty data is passed to it I get a SQL error of  .  
 I've also tried so that  NULL DEFAULT '0', however when empty data is passed, the table shows   instead of  .

 Assuming that you make the field nullable

 If you are explicitly setting the value to NULL in your insert, but want MySQL to replace the NULL with 0, one way to do that is to define the column to allow NULL in the   statement, and then replace the NULL with a  . 
 Something like this: 
 
 Try it for yourself in this  SQL Fiddle 
 
 You can use the   keyword to get the default value of the column during insertion. 
 Example : 
 
 
 Maybe you should try this: 
 
 
 You forgot to post the INSERT queries but I'm sure the problem is there. This works as expected: 
 
 ... because you omit   so MySQL uses the defalt. This doesn't: 
 
 ... because your are telling MySQL that you  want   .
