can i reset the value to 0 ? 
 
 You may either truncate the table using 
 
 Truncate will  **delete all of the data**
 in the table. Note that using   will also not fire any DELETE triggers like  . 
 Or you can reset the count using 
 
 It is however the expected behavior. Don't do the latter unless the table is truly empty. 
 
 To insert a primary key with value 0, execute first the following request : 
 
 
 Removing all the elements in a table does not affect the primary key. The primary key will still autoincrement from its last value. 
 If you want to reset the primary key, you can try to truncate the table: 
 
 This clears all the elements from yourtable. Whether it resets the primary key depends on your database. With Mysql it should work, as Mysql deletes and recreates the table on TRUNCATE. 
 
 You have to use the TRUNCATE statement to restart the auto_increment from 1.
It's the normal behavior to avoid braking things.
