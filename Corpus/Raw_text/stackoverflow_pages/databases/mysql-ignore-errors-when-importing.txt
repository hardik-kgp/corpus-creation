*** mysql-ignore-errors-when-importing ***

 I am importing a fairly large database. The   file has almost 1,000,000 lines in it. Problem is that I am getting a syntax error when trying to import the database. It says:  
 
 ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 8428420: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ' 
 Fatal error :  Maximum execution time of 600 seconds exceeded in 
 
 Normally I'd just open the .sql file and fix the error. But my computer is really struggling to open this file.  
 Is there any way I can ignore errors when importing a MySQL database?

 For example:
