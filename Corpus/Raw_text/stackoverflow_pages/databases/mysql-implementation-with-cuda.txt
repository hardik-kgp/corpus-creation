*** mysql-implementation-with-cuda ***

 I am a senior undergrad majoring in CS. At the moment I am taking a Computer Architecture class. We need to do a project. I want to do something related to CUDA, where the performance of the computation will have a moderate increase compred to a serial implementation. 
 I am really interested in databases so I decided to do something related to SQL. I only have experience with MySQL and I could not find anything related to how to work with MySQL using CUDA. There is only one reseasrch I could find about SQL and it uses SQLite. I am not sure what to do and how to gather information on this subject so I decided to take your opinions.

 You might want to look at implementation of SQL language which runs on GPU and uses CUDA.
it is open source so you can look at algorithms for joins, sorts and groupings.

 Just in case someone end-up in this page, the  PGStorm  is a module of foreign data wrapper of  **PostgreSQL**
 database. 
 
 
 Really?  Google found this from NVIDIA:

 They have a guide.  Is that not suitable?  It's certainly not for the faint of heart.
