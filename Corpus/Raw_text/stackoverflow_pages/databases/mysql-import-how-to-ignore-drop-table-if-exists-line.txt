*** mysql-import-how-to-ignore-drop-table-if-exists-line ***

 I exported 2 identical databases(identical in terms of names and structures of tables) into two .sql files using mysqldump. I want to merge them into one file. However, both the databases have a 'Drop table' line before every table. What that means is if I import db1 and then db2, db1 tables are dropped before db2 tables are imported. 
 The files are huge and I am not able to open them in the editor. Also, there are 50 tables in each databases. 
 How can I ignore the Drop table command during mysql import? 
 
 If you do not want to make dump once again and you are using Linux you can go with: 
 
 If you want to dump data once again you should pass   to mysqldump utility. 
 
 All you need is add   option when using  .  
 
 So, there would not   in   files. 
 see  docs of mysql on --skip-add-drop-table 
 
 I guess I don't see why a DROP TABLE statement should be problematic or why you need to merge dumps for two IDENTICAL databases. 
 That being said, you should probably just not add DROP TABLE in the initial dump.  This would be controlled via flag use in your mysqldump command as noted in the documention at  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysqldump.html 
 This probably means you need to use   flag if you were using default options (default is to run as if   flag is passed). You will then need to specify all flags within   that you still want to use.
