 I would like to know if it's possible in InnoDB in   to have a   with  **foreign key**
 that references another table in a different   ?  
 And if so, how this can be done ? 
 
 I do not see any limitation on  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-foreign-key-constraints.html  . 
 So just use  **otherdb.othertable**
 and you will be good.
