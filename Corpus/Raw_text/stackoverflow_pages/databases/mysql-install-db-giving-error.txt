*** mysql-install-db-giving-error ***

 I have downloaded the  **mysql-5.1.38-linux-x86_64-glibc23.tar.gz**
 from  here 
 and then i have executed it by using below command 
 
 and then i have edited the my.cnf and set the basedir and datadir to  **/home/mysql123/mysql**
 and  **/home/mysql123/mysql/data**
 and innodb_home_dir and logfile directory to datadir 
 Now edited mysql.server and set the datadir and basedir in them properly 
 and then initiated mysql_install_db as 
 
 on seeing the error i thought it may be confused with basedir and executed the same as below 
 
 i am not gettin what is going internally and showing this kind of message  
 and i am sure that i have enough diskspace (  **df -h**
 ) and i have proper ownership (  **chown mysq123:mysql /home/mysql123/ -R**
) and proper permissions (  **chmod 755 .**
) 
 and the lines in mysql_install_db are like below
 
 please any help to solve this problem is very useful ( and i have to follow the same installation process) 
 i am using redhat 6  
 
 Neither host '127.0.0.1' nor 'localhost' could be looked up with
./bin/resolveip 
 Just add string in /etc/hosts 
 
 Based on your prompt which identifies your host as 'localhost' in your screen shots it would appear that the program is designed to not accept that as a valid hostname. 
 Please change your hostname to something other than 'localhost'. 
 "Please configure the 'hostname' command to return a correct
hostname.
If you want to solve this at a later stage, restart this script
with the --force option" 
 Alternately, the above message suggests you can use the --force option to over ride this. But having a sensible hostname seems like the better path. 
 -HTH 
 
 Please execute below steps to resolve your ip Address. 
 
 logout from the box and login again. 
 It works fine. 
 Give a try. 
 
 I had this same problem and it was due to installing a 32bit MySQL in a 64bit system.  That became obvious when I ran   and it said  
 
 Despite it existing and being executable. 
 Solution was to change to using a 64bit mysql.  In your case it would seem you need to try the opposite - try 32bit instead.
