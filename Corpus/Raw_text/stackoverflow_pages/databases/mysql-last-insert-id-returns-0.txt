*** mysql-last-insert-id-returns-0 ***

 I've got this test table:  
 
 inserting using either of these three 
 
 and issuing  
 
 but the query always results in  . 
 PHP's   and   yield no result either. 
 I've been toying with this whole day and can't get it to work. Ideas? 
 
 The problem seemed to be in MySQL's phpmyadmin config file   set to   which resulted in a new   every time a query was issued - therefore rendering   ineffective. 
 more info in the subsequent topic  Every query creates a new CONNECTION_ID() 
 Also thanks  dnagirl  for help 
 
 Just my 50 cents for this issue, I simply noticed that you won't get a   greater than   if your table has no   set to an index. 
 I wasted about half hour on this. Turns out I keep getting a   of  , which for this table is actually ok. 
 
 you have to combine  
 
 Then you will get the last insert id 
 
 I had the same issue.   or   returned 0 when requested inside a PHP function with an  **INSERT query**
.  
 I sorted the issue by requesting the value of   from a separate PHP function called right after the function that  **INSERT query**
. 
 
 I Had the same issues but I have resolved this by creating a transaction. 
 
 I had tried 
 
 after the "commit" but that always returned "0" 
 hope that can help you 
 
 it work perfectly...try it...
