*** mysql-like-query-is-slow-with-full-text-index ***

 I'm using a simple mysql LIKE query like this: 
 
 I have a full-text index on "field", and still it is very slow.
I understood there is an option to use match. What is the difference? How? What is the best approach for my usage?

I've ended up using something like this:
 
 One thing I would like to change, is not due the order by firstly by SCORE and then by my field popularity, and instead order by a simple weight function, something like 0.5*SCORE + 0.5*popularity. How? 
 
  does not use the full-text index. To make use of the fulltext index, you have to use match (as you said): 
 
 The  MySQL Manual  has a extensive Chapter on  Full-Text Search Functions .
