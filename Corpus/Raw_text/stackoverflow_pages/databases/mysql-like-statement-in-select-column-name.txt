*** mysql-like-statement-in-select-column-name ***

 I am trying to select the column names from a specific table, where the table name is like '98673' 
 So I am using this: 
 
 However this will not result in any data.
Though I do have column names with '98673Blah' in there. 
 I know I must be doing something wrong, but what?? 
 
 For the LIKE you have to add a wildcard %, so: 
 
 
 USE  
 
  indicates a wildcard and returns any   that contains  
 
 Try it without the part   unless you really need it or: 
 
 For more information take a look at the documentation for: 
 
 LIKE operator   
 STRCMP() function 
 
 
 You need to add    
 
 this means that   contains  . 
 
 **One can do it this way too :**

 
 
 I think you need to add wildcard with table name also. 
 
 In this way you can get columns name list all tables and there columns name contain the text like '98673' from specific database or schema.  
 
 use this query
