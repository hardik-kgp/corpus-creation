*** mysql-looking-to-sum-these-unions-together ***

 OK, my head hurts...! 
 This beautiful MySQL query: 
 
 ...returns three rows of pretty numbers. 
 Ideally, I'd like this query to return all three "twitfollow" results, SUMmed together. 
 However, putting a SUM round them gives me an error about "every derived table must have its own alias", and I'm a little confused as to quite how to do solve that. 
 (Of course, I could just sum the results in PHP; but I am assuming that it's quicker to do this using the MySQL server. Would I be right?) 
 
 Use your entire query as the   clause of another query: 
 
 I also changed your   to   as you probably don't want to remove rows just because the sum from one table is equal to the sum from another table. 
 
 Just wrap a aggregating query around it: 
 
 
 Why not making it shorter, like below?
