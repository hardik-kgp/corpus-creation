*** mysql-multiple-row-as-comma-separated-single-row ***

 I have two tables : DISH and DISH_HAS_DISHES. Dish table has all the dishes and "Dish_has_dishes" table has a one-to-many relationship with "Dish" table. I.e. a dish can have multiple dishes. For example 
 **DISH**
 :  
 
 **DISH_HAS_DISHES**
 : 
 
 Here meal_id and dish_id both are IDs from DISH table. Now I want a format like this: 
 
 That is comma separated dish id and names for each meal. How to do that?
