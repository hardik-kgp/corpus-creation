*** mysql-order-by-two-columns ***

 I have a Table Like Below 
 

    CREATE TABLE Products(Product_id INT, ProductName VARCHAR(255), 
                          Featured enum('Yes', 'No'), Priority enum('p1', 'p2', 'p3'))


    INSERT INTO Products(ProductName, Featured, Priority) 
                  VALUES('Product A', 'Yes', 'p1'),
                        ('Product B', 'No',  'p2'),
                        ('Product C', 'Yes', 'p1'),
                        ('Product D', 'No',  'p1'),
                        ('Product E', 'Yes', 'p3'),
                        ('Product F', 'No',  'p2'),
                        ('Product G', 'Yes', 'p1'),
                        ('Product H', 'Yes', 'p2'),
                        ('Product I', 'No',  'p2'),
                        ('Product J', 'Yes', 'p3'),
                        ('Product K', 'Yes', 'p1'),
                        ('Product L', 'No',  'p3');


 
 I Need to get the Featured products followed by product with priority p1, p2 and p3  
 

Op:
   ProdName | Featured  | Priority

    Product A   Yes         p1
    Product C   Yes         p1
    Product G   Yes         p1
    Product K   Yes         p1
    Product H   Yes         p2
    Product E   Yes         p3
    Product J   Yes         p3
    Product D   No          p1
    Product B   No          p2
    Product F   No          p2
    Product I   No          p2
    Product L   No          p3

 
 I Wrote a query below which ain't working.. 
                                            
  SELECT * 
    FROM Products
   ORDER BY Featured IN ('Yes') desc,
            Priority IN ('p1', 'p2', 'p3') desc
 
 Could u plz spot mistake in that 
 
 Try this 
 
 If you use ORDER BY on mysql enum it will not order it by alphabetically but it will order it by its position in enum. 
 If you want to order alphabetically as you describe cast the enum name 
to a string like this 
 
 
 Why don't you simply use SQL as : 
 
 By doing this   will appear before  .   will appear before   and   before  . I believe, that is what you want. 
 If data type issue in ordering then, 
 
 
 Check this query-- 
 
 Fiddle 
 Working code check fiddle 
 
 
 This should work
