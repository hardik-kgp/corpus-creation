*** mysql-pdo-how-to-bind-like ***

 In this query  
 
 I'm trying to bind the variable   with PDO. Not sure how this works with the   at the end.  
 Would it be  
 
 where   is bound to    
 or would it be  
 
 where   is bound to  
 or would it be something entirely different? 
 
 You could also say: 
 
 to do the string joining at the MySQL end, not that there's any particular reason to in this case. 
 Things get a bit more tricky if the partial   you are looking for can itself contain a percent or underscore character (since those have special meaning for the LIKE operator) or a backslash (which MySQL uses as another layer of escaping in the LIKE operator — incorrectly, according to the ANSI SQL standard). 
 Hopefully that doesn't affect you, but if you do need to get that case right, here's the messy solution: 
 
 
 
 Using question mark parameters:

 You can use addcslashes before prepared statement. I tested on mysql. 
 
 
 I think the accepted answer (by @bobince) can be simplified a bit. 
 You can reduce it to something like this to handle underscore, percentage, etc in the param but still match the LIKE query with partial%: 
 
 
 The below code it shows only the first keywords in the database!  
 
 Try this one if you want to search all the keywords from the database 
 
 
 This is how you should do it

 Using question mark parameters: 
 
 
 Many thanks to him. I was searching for the code & saw many examples, but i couldn't resolve my issue. This time I have succeed to do it. I used the 'Using question mark parameters:' section of the code.  
 For others help, if you want to retrieve the value from a variable you may change the code to  
 
 instead of 
 
 Because the word 'partial' is specified in the answer and can't be changed. Thanks a lot.
