*** mysql-pid-ended-cannot-start-mysql ***

 I have a clean install of MySQL (mysql-5.5.24-osx10.6-x86_64).  I am on Lion (OS 10.7.4) with a Mac Pro Quad Core. I installed MySQL the GUI installer and also installed the pref pane and the startup item.  
 However when I run: 
 
 I get this message: 
 
 I also cannot start MySQL from the preference pane. 
 Here is what I have tried so far based on the hours of Googling and research today: 
 **Permissions issues?**

 This: 
 
 and 
 
 This: 
 
 **Link issues?**

 This: 
 in /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server -- I did: 
 
 
 In the file /etc/rc.common add the follow line at end:
  /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql & 
 
 This: 
 
 I also tried the  removal process here  and reinstalled but this did not seem to make a difference. I also launched Activity Monitor in OS X to see if any other mySQL processes were running by chance but they were not.  
 Nothing above worked so I am sort of at wits end. Here is the log from the .err file located at: 
 
 **Update:**
 I upgraded the same machine from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion 10.8.1 and MySQL works perfectly fine now with the upgrade, I had to do nothing extra.  
 
 I have the same problem when installing mysql newest version mysql-5.6.10-osx10.7-x86.dmg for my MAC OS 10.7.5. Following is my solutions.
First , delete the mysql installed 
 
 Then, get  mysql-5.1.68-osx10.6-x86.dmg  , install this old version, and done! 
 
 since I cannot post comments (got <50 reputation :( ) I am writing it here :) 
 as @AndPy says, the same with me, if you   the   you can see that the file   is owned by   or some such.... in this case just erase the file and   will create new one owned by your user and will start properly this time :) 
 If the file is already owned by your user, this wont help, you got to google more :(  
 
 I found this error on redmine bitnami stack because owner of files in directory data incorrect. 
 Check owner of directory /mysql/data/ must be 'mysql' user 
 Hope this help. 
 
 I had the same problem after updating to OS X Mavericks. 
 
 Starting MySQL . ERROR! The server quit without updating PID file 
 
 Like  Redrick  and  AndPy  mentioned I also had to rename (actually I deleted the file) the error file located in  . My error file was called  . After removing the file with   I could finally start MySQL again with  . 
 
 I had the same problem.  
 In /usr/local/var/mysql I found a file in the form COMPUTER-NAME.local.err. Simply changing that file name solved the problem. I could now start the mysql server with  
 
 mysql.server start 
 
 
 My answer is very similar to others, but slightly different and this applies mostly to a bitnami mamp stack. The fix for me was: 
 
 The   directory is the one located in  
 The above sets the mysql to be the owner of the mysql directory recursively into the other directories. 
 
 If you want to absolutely get this thing working do the following: 
 You need to uninstall mysql first so do that, before you do this though, make sure you have a backup of all your DBs. 
 
 Then you need to make sure certain files are uninstalled, make a batch script of the following commands and run it: 
 
 Go to   using your favorite editing program and remove the line  
 Then run   then install mysql using  
 After you've done this you'll probably get the same error again. Head over to the folder  . There should be a file in there called  
 run   and look in the file. You should see something similar to:  
 
 
 If you do, run the command   and you'll probably get something back like this: 
 
 This means mysql is already running and listening on port 3306 and you need to kill it. Use   to kill the program or just use Activity Monitor to kill it. Either way once that's done go back to   and delete the folder  . 
 Once that's done run mysql.server start and you should get the following: 
 
 And congrats. I've been trying to fix this for a week and it's such an easy fix and I just figured it out. I hate myself. 
 
 120515 18:13:01 [ERROR] Can't open the mysql.plugin table. Please run mysql_upgrade to create it. 
 
 Regarding this error, I assume that you have specified a datadir in my.cnf. If you are using a non-default data directory for MySQL, you need to move folders mysql and performance_schema (whichever exists) to the data directory specified in my.cnf. You can find these folders in mysql directory. 
 
 In MySQL 5.5+ the --skip-locking option is removed. Use --skip-external-locking instead. Refer to MySQL documentation -->  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-nutshell.html  
Quote: "The --enable-locking and --skip-locking server options (use --external-locking and --skip-external-locking)." 
 
 Give this a whirl..  
 
 Navigate to the problem's parent directory  
  (deletes file) 
  (generates new *.local.pid file the error thrown was complaining about) 
 cd back into your project and restart mysql using  
 
 
 Only removing  **mysql-bin.index**
 file in /usr/local/var/mysql/ helped me.
