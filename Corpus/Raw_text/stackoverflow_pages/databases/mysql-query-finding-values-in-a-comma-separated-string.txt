*** mysql-query-finding-values-in-a-comma-separated-string ***

 I have a field   in a my table   that contains a comma delimited string such as  . Each number representing the available colors. 
 When running the query   to get all the red shirts (color=1), I also get the shirts who's color is grey (=12) and orange (=15).  
 How should I rewrite the query so that is selects ONLY the color 1 and not all colors containing the number 1? 
 
 The classic way would be to add commas to the left and right: 
 
 But  find_in_set  also works: 
 
 
 FIND_IN_SET  is your friend in this case 
 
 
 Take a look at the  FIND_IN_SET  function for MySQL. 
 
 
 This will work for sure, and I actually tried it out: 
 
 Give it a Try !!! 
 
 If the set of colors is more or less fixed, the most efficient and also most readable way would be to use string constants in your app and then use MySQL's   type with   in your queries. When using the   type with  FIND_IN_SET , MySQL uses one integer to store all values and uses binary   operation to check for presence of values which is way more efficient than scanning a comma-separated string. 
 In  ,   would be stored internally as  ,   would be stored internally as   and   would be stored internally as  . The value   would be stored as   ( ) and   as   ( ). 
 
 If you're using MySQL, there is a method REGEXP that you can use...

 So then you would use: 
 
 
 You should actually fix your database schema so that you have three tables: 
 
 Then if you want to find all of the shirts that are red, you'd do a query like: 
 
 
 
 Works for me 
 
 You can achieve this by following function. 
 Run following query to create function. 
 
 And call this function like this 
 
 Hope it'd help.
