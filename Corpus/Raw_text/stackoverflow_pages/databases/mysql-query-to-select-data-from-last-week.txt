*** mysql-query-to-select-data-from-last-week ***

 Hi I have a table with a date field and some other information.
I want to select all entries from the past week, (week start from Sunday). 
 table values: 
 
 I want to select all ids from last week, expected output is 5, 6, 8.
 (id 2 not in last week, and id 15 is in current week.) 
 How to write and SQL Query for the same. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I use the YEARWEEK function specifically to go back to the prior whole calendar week (as opposed to 7 days before today). YEARWEEK also allows a second argument that will set the start of the week or determine how the first/last week of the year are handled. YEARWEEK lets you to keep the number of weeks to go back/forward in a single variable, and will not include the same week number from prior/future years, and it's far shorter than most of the other answers on here. 
 
 Simplified form: 
 **Last week data:**
  
 
 **2 weeks ago data:**
  
 
 **SQL Fiddle**

 You can make your calculation in php and then add it to your query: 
 
 now this will give the date for a week ago 
 
 Probably the most simple way would be: 
 
 For 8 days (i.e. Monday - Monday) 
 
 You'll need to calc which day relative to today is Sunday in your middleware (php, python, etc.)* 
 Then, 
 
 
 may be a way to get sunday's date relative to today in MySQL as well; that would be arguably the cleaner solution if not too expensive to perform 
 
 
 It can be in a single line:  
 
 
 A simple way can be this one, this is a real example from my code and works perfectly: 
 
 
 PLEASE people... 'Last week' like the OP asked and where I was looking for (but found none of answers satisfying) is THE LAST WEEK.  
 If today is Tuesday, then  LAST WEEK  is Monday  A WEEK AGO  to Sunday  A WEEK AGO . 
 So: 
 
 Or for ISO weeks: 
 
 
 The above query will not work.
After the   clause, if we can not   the column value, then it will not work. You should   the column value.  
 e.g.: 
 
 
 
 
 I often do a quick "last week" check as well and the following tends to work well for me and includes today. 
 
 If you want this to NOT include today just subtract an extra day from the @EndDate.  If I select these two variables today get  
 
 @StartDate 2015-11-16 16:34:05.347     /* Last Monday */ 
 @EndDate   2015-11-23 16:34:05.347     /* This Monday */ 
 
 If I wanted Sunday to Sunday I would have the following. 
 
 
 @StartDate 2015-11-15 16:34:05.347 /* Previous Sunday */ 
 @EndDate 2015-11-22 16:34:05.347 /* Last Sunday */ 
 
 
 
 
 You can also use it esay way 
 
 
 i Use this for the week start from SUNDAY: 
 
 
 For more example Like last month, last year, last 15 days, last 3 months   
 Fetch Last WEEK Record 
 Using the below MySQL query for fetching the last week records from the mysql database table. 
 
 
 Try this: 
 
 
 If you already know the dates then you can simply use between, like this:
