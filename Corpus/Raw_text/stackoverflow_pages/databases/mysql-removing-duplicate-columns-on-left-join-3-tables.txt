*** mysql-removing-duplicate-columns-on-left-join-3-tables ***

 I have three tables, each have a foreign key. When I perform a  join, I get duplicate columns. 
 Given 
 
 My query statement: 
 
 My objective is to get one row of all the columns from the join without duplicate columns.
So what is the SQL statement syntax that I should use? 
 
 By default MySQL will return all columns for all tables if you use  . You will need to explicitly enter column names in your query to retrieve them the way you want. Use the query as follows: 
 
 
 The problem can be solved by "USING" keyword. 
 
 In your case the query will become 
 
 The point is Simple,
If you have two Tables A(a,b) and B(b,c) then after joining to produce the result in the form of (a,b,c) 
 
 will give the Result-Set with three columns(a,b,c)      
 NOTE : Since I don't know whether we can use multiple params in Using, therefore I made it as subquery. 
 
 You are not getting duplicate columns, what you are really getting is the Supervisor_ID column from table Family (that is Family.Supervisor_ID) and Supervisor_ID from table Supervisor (that is Supervisor.Supervisor_ID) but to your result set, you will see both as Supervisor_ID, and that is why you think they are duplicated. The same will happen with Center_iD. 
 The solution is to specify the fields that you need from each table, and decide if you need to get the Supervisor_ID and Center_ID and which table to get it from. 
 
 According to oreilly, 
 Look for an  explain plan . 
You can do a _select x from y inner join.... where w=z ... this is just an example
