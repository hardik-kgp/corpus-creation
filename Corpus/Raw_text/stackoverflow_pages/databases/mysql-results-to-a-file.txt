*** mysql-results-to-a-file ***

 How do I write the results from a mysql query to file?  I just need something quick.  Output can be CSV, XML, HTML, etc. 
 
 
 (the docs show INTO OUTFILE up in the SELECT .. portion which may work as well, but I've never tried it that way)
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html 
 INTO OUTFILE creates a file on the server; if you are on a client and want it there, do: 
 
 
 if you have phpMyAdmin installed, it is a nobrainer: Run the query (haven't got a copy loaded, so I can't tell you the details, but it really is easy) and check neer bottom for export options. CSV will be listed, but I think you can also have SQL if you like :) 
 phpMyAdmin will give CSV in Excels dialect, which is probably what you want... 
 
 You can use  MySQL Query Browser  to run the query and then just go to File -> Export Resultset and choose the output format. The options are CSV, HTML, XML, Excel and PLIST.
