*** mysql-search-for-segment-of-table-name ***

 I'm trying to select tables in a mysql database which have the same ending, e.g. staff_name, manager_name, customer_name (example). 
I was thinking of something along the lines of the following because it works if I have a definite table name. 
 
 I also tried this using a % instead of the _ with no luck. I'm not sure if there are other wildcards I could try. I've looked around, but none of the results seem to apply to parts of table names :/ Any suggestions?
