*** mysql-user-creation-script ***

 I'm trying to automate MySQL user creation procedure.
I thought of creating a temp file that would contain mysql user creation statements,
then I would have call it like this : 
 mysql -u root -proot < temp 
 But I'm stuck with mysql syntax :
here's the content of my temp file : 
 
 
 
 But the line 
 
 (Password hash should be a 41-digit hexadecimal number ) 
 is not interpreted as I would expect it to be.
Even if I remove single quotes around the @password tag I still have errors (syntax error) 
 How can I make this work ? 
 
 Just to answer why the error occurs and to show the differnce: 
 
 **A) Expects **
** to be a **
**hash string **
**1**
** value:**

 
 Note the use of the   keyword! 
 
 **B) Expects **
** to be a **
**clear-text string**
** value:**

 
 Note the  **missing**
   keyword! 
 **1**
 Where "hash string" is the result of   - see  Snowman's answer  for an example. 
 
 If you do not want to store password in clear text, then save it in hashed format - 
 
 Where hashed password is a result of this query - 
 
 
 I have also got same problem, it is resolved just by setting the password by mentioned query below. 
 
 
 Take a look at the following url and this will help you to fix the issue:

 try: 
 
 where PASSWORD is your password (in quotes). 
 
 I opened phpMYAdmin and went to the the users tab, found the user i was trying to connect with clicked Edit Privileges, scrolled down to the Change Login Information / Copy User section and choose  **Any host**
 for the Host option, it was set to local.  When I clicked the Go button, it generated a script similar to the ones listed here. 
 
 
 Well hat is error bcoz you have wrote the wrong way just you have wrote, 
 
 and the true syntax is follows. look here. 
 
 because your password is causing that error. it must be in as shown.
