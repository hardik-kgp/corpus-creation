 Does anyone know a good (preferably open source and cross platform) tool to allow simple visualization of mysql databases?  I just need a tool I can quickly point at a database and it'll show basic table structure and field types, etc.  Nothing too advanced or crazy.   
 
 MySQL Workbench  runs on Windows and Linux. The commercial version will let you reverse engineer and edit the stucture of a live database, with the free one you have first to dump the structure to a file. Its ancestor  DBDesigner  is a bit older, but doesn't have this limitation. Windows and Linux too. 
 If these two are overkill you may try with  HeidiSQL , the descendant of MySQLFront. It runs on Windows only, but there is an alpha version running on Java. 
 
 I really like  Sqlyog  on Windows. It is (technically) open source, but not cross-platform. (Scroll down to "community edition") 
 If your requirements are open source, simple, and cross-platform, hav eyou considered setting up a website with  phpMyAdmin ?

 There's also MySQL Workbench.  It's more for design, but would do what you ask.  There's a free version which is a little crippled and I think it might be Windows only. 
 EDIT:  There is a Linux version.

 Sqlyog community should be fine
