*** mysql-why-varchar254-and-not-varchar255 ***

 Why do so many developers set varchar to 254 and not 255 when creating MySQL tables? 
 Proof that this happens:  mysql varchar 254 
 
 varchar fields require n+1 bytes for fields less than or equal to 255
and required n+2 bytes for fields > 255

 It should be set to 255, I'm assuming developers think they will save an extra byte from 254, but 255 is the standard 
 
 Your Google query gave you the hints already. One of the first hits is this:

 It basically says, that   indexes on   require twice the space of a   FULLTEXT index. And some more other bloat on top of that. 
 I think this is far more important than saving one byte in the data table.
