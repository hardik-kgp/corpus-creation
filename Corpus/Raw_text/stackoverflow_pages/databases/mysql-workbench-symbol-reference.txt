*** mysql-workbench-symbol-reference ***

 I'm looking at a database diagram generated by MySQL Workbench (actually, DBDesigner4), but I'm not familiar with it so I couldn't figure out some of the symbols it uses for relationships and fields. Does anyone know a good legend? 
 
 According to  Wikipedia , MySQL Workbench uses the Crows's Foot notation. These are (incomplete) references, but together they paint the whole picture:

(covers entities a little better); 
 http://www.scribd.com/doc/464379/Crows-Foot-Notation-ER-Diagrams 
(better job at explaining cardinality
notation); 
 https://web.archive.org/web/20090724165001/http://www.gc.maricopa.edu/business/sylvester/cis164/er2b.htm  (covers solid and dashed lines -- identifying and non-identifying relationships--, which are missing from the first two references). 
 
 
 I don't know DBDesigner4, but I'm sometimes using MySQL Workbench. 
 It allows you to do modelisations using UML diagrams ; so, I suppose the symbols are quite close to those generally used with UML. 
 Searching about UML might get you some helpful answers ; for instance, taking a look at those pages : 
 
 Unified Modeling Language 
 Entity-relationship model 
 Class diagram 
 
 Those will probably not get you all the answers you seek ; but they will most likely at least answer some of them :-) 
 And reading those can only be good for you, considering you are using UML ;-)
