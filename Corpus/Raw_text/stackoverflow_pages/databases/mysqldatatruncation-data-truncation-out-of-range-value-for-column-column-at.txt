 I am using java and MySQL.  I am trying to insert a value into a table. 
 When I insert, I get this exception: 
 
 Only 5% of inserts produces this exception, others work.  What does the error mean and how do I prevent it? 
 
 It means that the data you are storing in   doesn't fit. For example a string might be too long, or a number too large. 
 What is the datatype of  ? And what are you trying to store in it? 
 
 **How to produce this Exception on the MySQL console:**

 
 You tried to cram 1234 into a column that could take maximum 9.9 repeated.  Notice the row is still inserted. 
 **You can get the MySQL console to prevent this conversion using strict mode:**

 
 The insert command failed in attempting add a second row to penguin: 
 
 **Solutions**

 
 Expand the size of the datatype in your column to accept the value you put in there. 
 Shrink the size of the value that you are trying to cram into a small data type. 
 
 
 This type of error message can shown for different scenario. 
 **I have defined One reason :**
  
 In my case the problem that I had defined the  
 
 double (17,17) 
 
 ... that mean 17 digits and 17 d√©cimals so it rests 0 for the interger!!!!!!
with  
 
 double(24;12) 
 
 everuthing is OK  
 
 To me the problem was of unsigned datatype, removing the flag has fixed my problem.
