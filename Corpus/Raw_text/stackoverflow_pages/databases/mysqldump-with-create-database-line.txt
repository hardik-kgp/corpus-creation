*** mysqldump-with-create-database-line ***

 I'm in the process of moving my files onto another computer, and one thing I would like to do is to transfer the data in my MySQL database. I want to dump the databases into .sql files, but also have the create database db_name including in the file, that way I just have to import the file to mysql without having to manually create the databases. Is there a way to do that? 
 
 By default   always creates the   statement at the beginning of the dump file. 
 [ **EDIT**
] Few things about the   file and it's options: 
 ,  
 Dump all tables in all databases. This is the same as using the   option and naming all the databases on the command line. 
 
 Add a   statement before each   statement. This option is typically used in conjunction with the   or   option because no   statements are written unless one of those options is specified. 
 ,  
 Dump several databases. Normally,   treats the first name argument on the command line as a database name and following names as table names. With this option, it treats all name arguments as database names.   and   statements are included in the output before each new database. 
 ,  
 This option suppresses the   statements that are otherwise included in the output if the   or   option is given. 
 Some time ago, there was similar question actually asking about not having such statement on the beginning of the file (for XML file).  Link to that question  is here . 
 So to answer your question: 
 
 if you have one database to dump, you should have the
  option in your   statement. 
 if you have multiple databases to dump, you should use the option
  or   and the   syntax will be added
automatically

 The simplest solution is to use option -B or --databases.Then CREATE database command appears in the output file.
For example: 
 
 Here is a dumpfile's header: 
 
 
 Here is how to do dump the database (with just the schema): 
 
 If you also want the data, remove the   option.
