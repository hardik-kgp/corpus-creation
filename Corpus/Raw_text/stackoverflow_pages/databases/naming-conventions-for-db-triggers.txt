*** naming-conventions-for-db-triggers ***

 Are there any naming conventions for DB triggers?  
 For example "before delete on users" would be "bdUsers" or something like that. 
 
 For sorting reasons I would recommend a structured approach: 
 
 and so on. 
 In the end it's up to you - but whatever you choose to do, stay consistent, at least within the same database. 
 
 I agree with @tomalak - but i normally spell out the action at the end instead of abbreviating it...
