*** naming-of-boolean-column-in-database-table ***

 I have 'Service' table and the following column description as below  
 
 Is User Verification Required for service ? 
 Is User's Email Activation Required for the service ? 
 Is User's Mobile Activation required for the service ? 
 
 I Hesitate in naming these columns as below  
 
 or 
 
 **I can't determined which way is the best  .So, Is one of the above suggested name is the best or is there other better ones ?**

 
 I would (and do) use "IsVerificationRequired" 
 I try to add some meaning to my column names so it's obvious (ValueDate, InsertedDateTime, IsActive, HazCheezBurger, ProductName etc). "Isxxxx" implies yes/no for example without thinking  and  you only have 2 states unlike "ProductName". 
 
 Run with the   variants, or at the very least swap the   to  . Booleans should be phrased as questions. Is, Can, Has, Should, they're all good prefixes for Boolean functions/columns. See  1370840  for more arguments on this 
 
 I would choose VerificationRequired, EmailActivationRequired etc. 
 Database is the snapshot of the state, so the above said column names goes better over the ones you have mentioned in my opinion. 
 
 I would go for the one that fits more the syntax you are using in your current project. Either one is fine since they describe what the variable contains, the only thing you need to worry about is that you keep the same naming standard for all your project. If you haven't decide any naming standard for your project yet, the first one would be better since it is what is closer of the Java Bean naming standard which is something that a lot of developer are used to.
