*** need-a-complete-example-for-dynamodb-with-php ***

 I want to write service in php where - 
 1) DynamoDB will have table t with two columns key and val 
 2) I will check if some key exists in table t or not. 
 3) If exist read data .. if don't exist insert new key-value in table t 
 I was checking some links
 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/index.html#m=AmazonDynamoDB/put_item 
 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/quick-start.html 
 Which one to follow ? 
 Also can someone give me quick example and exact syntax. 
 Thanks in advance.  
 
 The full walkthrough is located  HERE . It gives you a step by step outline of the setup process for credentials and comes with a easy to use add on to the  PHP SDK for AWS 
 **AWS Setup**


- AWS doesn't lay out the Credentials setup for you set by step, so I will.

 
 **1.**
 Go to AWS and get your  **PUBLIC_KEY**
 and  **PRIVATE_KEY**

 
 AWS does have tutorials for this  HERE  and  HERE 
 
 **2.**
 Open Terminal 
 **3.**
 If you haven't created your credentials yet, in Terminal's fresh page, type in: 
 
 
 The   function page will open up. You will see   at the top. 
 
 **4.**
 Inside the   page, type in: 
 
 **5.**
 Once you've typed it out, hit  **CONTROL + X**
 (Yes...Control, not Command). 
 **6.**
 Hit  **Y**
 then  **ENTER**

 **7.**
 Get the [AWS_SDK_PHP][4] 
 **8.**
 Go to Your Elastic Beanstalk 
 **9.**
 When you are done creating your app and you see the  Overview  screen with the green check. Look to the side and hit  Configuration . 
 **10.**
 Under  **Software Configuration**
 ->  **Document root:**
 type in:  **/**

 **11.**
 Under  **Property Name**
 ->  **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**
 type in:  **[your_access_key]**

 **12.**
 Under  **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**
 is the  **AWS_SECRET_KEY**
, type in:  **[your_secret_key]**

 **13.**
 When your PHP Project is ready. Put all your files into one folder. Name the folder  **[whatever]**
, then compress the files inside  **[whatever]**
. Do not compress the whole folder. Only compress the files in the folder. If one of these files includes your  **index.php**
 or  **index.html**
, your project will show up on EBS default URL. 
 **14.**
 Your project should be called  Archive.zip  (Mac). Go to EBS, upload the zip and there you go! All finished with AWS Setup! 
 
 **AWS Setup**

 
 **1.**
  Put the  AWS_SDK_PHP  in an empty folder 
 **2.**
  At the top of the file using the SDK (  or whatever), put in:
 
 
 
 
 
 **Data Types**

 
 **S**
 = String 
 **N**
 = Number 
 **B**
 = Binary 
 
 
 
 
 **The Basic Methods**

 
 **Describe Table**

 
 **Put Item**

 
 **Get Item**

 
 **Delete Item**

 
 **Query Item**

 
 
 
 Hope this helps.
