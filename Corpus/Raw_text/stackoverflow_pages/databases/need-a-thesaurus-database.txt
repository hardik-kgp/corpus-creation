 Is there an open source thesaurus available for download? It can be in any format. Preferably not from a 1915 dictionary. I need one to merge into a database application. 
 
 There are a number of opensource thesaurus, in several languages, available here:  http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries 
 I used some of them to build a web service providing thesaurus service:  http://thesaurus.altervista.org/
