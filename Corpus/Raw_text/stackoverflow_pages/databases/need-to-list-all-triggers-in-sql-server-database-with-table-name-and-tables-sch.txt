*** need-to-list-all-triggers-in-sql-server-database-with-table-name-and-tables-sch ***

 I need to list all triggers in SQL Server database with table name and table's schema. 
 I'm almost there with this: 
 
 I just need to get the table's schema also. 
 
 Here's one way: 
 
 **EDIT**
:
Commented out join to sysusers for query to work on AdventureWorks2008. 
 
 **EDIT 2**
: For SQL 2000 
 
 
 Here you go. 
 
 A couple of things here... 
 Also I see that you were attempting to pull the parent tables schema information, I believe in order to do so you would also need to join the sysobjects table on itself so that you can correctly get the schema information for the parent table. the query above does this. Also the sysusers table wasn't needed in the results so that Join has been removed. 
 tested with SQL 2000, SQL 2005, and SQL 2008 R2 
 
 I had the same task recently and I used the following for sql server 2012 db.  Use management studio and connect to the database you want to search. Then execute the following script. 
 
 
 You can also get the body of triggers as following: 
 
 
 
 
 **Use this query :**
  
 
 It's simple and useful. 
 
 And what do you think about this: Very short and neat    :) 
 
 
 
 this working for me 
 
 This is what I use (usually wrapped in something I stuff in Model): 
 
 As you see it is a skosh more McGyver, but I think it's worth it: 
 
 (Scroll right to see the final and most useful column) 
 
 Use This Query : 
 
 
 this may help. 
 
 
 If you are looking for   triggers, remember MS-SQL has both SQL-based triggers ( ) and CLR-based triggers ( ). 
 
 The just above code is incorrect as shown: 
 
 
 Necromancing.  
Just posting because all solutions so far fall a bit short of completeness.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One difficulty is that the text, or description has line feeds. My clumsy kludge, to get it in something more tabular, is to add an   literal to the   clause, copy and paste everything to notepad, save with an html extension, open in a browser, then copy and paste to a spreadsheet.
example 
 
 you may still need to fool around with tabs to get the description into one field, but at least it'll be on one line, which I find very helpful. 
 
 **C# Cribs:**
 I ended up with this super generic one liner.  Hope this is useful to both the original poster and/or people who just typed the same question I did into Google: 
 
 Query Characteristics: 
 
 Usable with any SQL database (i.e. Initial Catalog) 
 Self explanatory 
 One single statement 
 Pasteable directly into most IDE's for most languages
