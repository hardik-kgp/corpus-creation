*** neo4j-and-big-log-files ***

 I try to use n4j in my app, but I have problem with big log files. Are they necessary or is there some way to reduce the number and size of them? 
 At the moment I see files like: 
 
 nioneo_logical.log.v0 
 nioneo_logical.log.v1 
 nioneo_logical.log.v2 
 
 etc
and they are ~26MB each (over 50% of neo4j folder). 
 
 These files are created whenever the logical logs are rotated. 
 You can configure rules for them in the server properties file. 
 See details here:  http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/configuration-logical-logs.html 
 You can safely remove them (but only the *.v*) if your database is shutdown and in a clean state. Don't remove them while the db is running because they could be needed in case of recovery on a crash.
