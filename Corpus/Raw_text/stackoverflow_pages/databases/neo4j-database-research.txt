*** neo4j-database-research ***

 I recently started researching database features of databases. 
At the moment I'm looking into Neo4j Graph database. 
 Unfortunately, I can't find every bit of information I need.
I found most information except the following: 
 
 Supporting datatypes? (Integer,  
 Max. database size? 
 Max. nodes in db? 
 Max. relations in db? 
 
 
 The supported datatypes: 
 
 boolean or boolean[] 
 byte or byte[] 
 short or short[] 
 int or int[] 
 long or long[] 
 float or float[] 
 double or double[] 
 char or char[] 
 java.lang.String or String[]

 There's no limit on database size, but the current release (1.2) has limitations on the number of nodes, relationships and properties. The limit on each of these is 4 billion. The work on increasing the limits is done right now, and will be included in a milestone release soon. The new limit is 32B on nodes and relationships and 64B on properties. 
 In the 1.3.M03 milestone release support for a more efficient way of storing short strings was included, which will lower disk consumption considerably for many datasets. See  Better support for short strings in Neo4j .
