 I have created Net Core 3.0 app and following code that worked in 2.2 now is not. 
 
 Looks like in 3.0 class   does not exist within   namespace. Am I missing some dependency? I have EntityFrameworkCore NuGet with Tools and Design added. 
 Adding  
 
 not helped. 
 
 Add a reference to 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore', it appears that function is in that package now.
