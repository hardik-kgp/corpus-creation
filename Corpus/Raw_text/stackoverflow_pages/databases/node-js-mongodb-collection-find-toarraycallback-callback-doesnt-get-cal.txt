*** node-js-mongodb-collection-find-toarraycallback-callback-doesnt-get-cal ***

 I am just starting out with mongodb, but I am running into a problem when trying to use .find() on a collection. 
 I've created a DataAccessObject which opens a specific databate and then lets your perform operations on it. Here is the code: 
 The  **constructor**
: 
 
 A  **getCollection**
 function: 
 
 A  **save**
 function: 
 
 And what seems to be the problematic one -  **a findAll function**
: 
 
 Whenever I try to dao. **findAll(error, callback)**
, the  **callback**
 never gets called.
I've narrowed the problem down to the following part of the code: 
 
 I've looked at how other people do it. In fact, I'm following  this tutorial  very closely. No one else seems to have this problem with colelction.find().toArray(), and it doesn't come up in my searches. 
 Thanks,

 You are not using the   callback so if you are trying to make the   request right after creating the   then it won't be ready. 
 If your code is like this, it will not work. 
 
 I tested it and it doesn't find records, and it also gives no error. I think it should give an error. 
 But if you change it so that you give a callback to the constructor, then it should work. 
 
 And make your code like this.
