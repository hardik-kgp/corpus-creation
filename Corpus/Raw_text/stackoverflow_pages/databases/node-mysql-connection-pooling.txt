*** node-mysql-connection-pooling ***

 I am using node-mysql module ( https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql ) OR ( http://utahjs.com/2010/09/22/nodejs-and-mysql-introduction/ ) .  
 Is this API handling connection pooling as well? 
 I mean with every user request I am calling   to query the MySQL and to release  the connection:  . 
 Is this the right way, or should I connect/disconnect only once in a code. 
 I am learning from this document:  https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql/blob/master/Readme.md 
 
 Update: Feb 2013 - pool support has been added to node-mysql, see  docs 
 Example using built-in pool: 
 
 Pre 2013 solutions: 
 You can use  node-pool  or  mysql-pool  or use your own simple round-robin pool 
 
 now you can hope to have all queries callbacks to execute in 1 second: 
 
 
 The node-mysql module support connection pool now. 
 Reference:  https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql#pooling-connections 
 
 I believe same node-mysql package provides connection pooling. Have a look
