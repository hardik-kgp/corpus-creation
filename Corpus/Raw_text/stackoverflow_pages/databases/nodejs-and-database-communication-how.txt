*** nodejs-and-database-communication-how ***

 I've heard much good about nodejs and writting client-server application with it. But I can't get, for example, when developing IM client-server application, how nodejs server script is supposed to talk to database server to actually store it's data? Or may be I miss something and nodejs server scripts are not supposed to do that? If so, please, push me to correct direction. 
 I've noticed DBSLayer  http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer/wiki , but it looks like it's still in beta. 
 
 You need to grab a module that handles the communication to the database you want.  See here  for a list of modules for node.js. Popular databases that work well with node.js are  MongoDB ,  CouchDB  and  Redis . 
 
 As stagas says, you can use a module that handles communication if you want to use an external database. 
 If you want an internal (=embedded) database, you can use one written in javascript you can require like any other module such as  NeDB  or  nStore . They are easier to use and useful if your webapp doesn't need to handle a lot of concurrent connections (e.g. a tool you make for yourself or a small team), or if you write a desktop app using  Node Webkit
