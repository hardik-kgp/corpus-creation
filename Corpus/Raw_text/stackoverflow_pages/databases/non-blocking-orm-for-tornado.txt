*** non-blocking-orm-for-tornado ***

 Is there any asynchronous Python ORM other than  Twistar ?  
 I'm looking for lightweight ORM for non-blocking API, built on top of tornado. Of course, I can write raw SQL queries using momoko, but I'd like to work with objects.  
 
 It's been 5 years, and a lot changed. We wrote  GINO  to be a lightweight ORM on top of  asyncpg  and  SQLAlchemy core . It is for asyncio and PostgreSQL only. GINO as "GINO Is Not ORM", because it applied almost none usual ORM patterns, in order to be explicit and simple. 
 
 Sure, it is! Look at  peewee  and  peewee-async  extension. Disclaimer: extension is only for PostgreSQL at the moment and I'm an author of extension :) 
 It's not specifically for Tornado, but Tornado can run on asyncio event loop. 
 
 None exist. The only ORM that could even consider coming close to being lightweight is  PeeWee , and that isn't async. ORMs are hard to write, and even harder to write  **well**
. It needs to have a nice, clean API, expose many features of the underlying DB,  and  be efficient. A tall order! 
 There aren't many ORMs for Python, and even fewer async ones. Sorry. 
 
 Have a look at Tortoise  ORM 
 Its aiming to be a full-featured   inspired by  , but asycnio only.
Since   runs on asyncio, it should just work. 
 
 If using mongo you can look into Asyncmongo (not an orm but let's you access your data Async)
 https://github.com/bitly/asyncmongo 
 if it is of interest see video and slides from this webminar: "Asynchronous MongoDB with Python and Tornado"  http://www.10gen.com/presentations/webinar/Asynchronous-MongoDB-with-Python-and-Tornado 
 
 You may want to have a look at  Monguo , a "full-featured, asynchronous MongoDB ORM with Motor driver for Tornado applications" as it describes itself. 
 
 You may want to have a look at umysqldb( https://github.com/hongqn/umysqldb ), A MySQLdb compatible wrapper around ultramysql. ultramysql compatible with gevent through monkey patching.
