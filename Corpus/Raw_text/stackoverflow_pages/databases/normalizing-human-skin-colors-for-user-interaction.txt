*** normalizing-human-skin-colors-for-user-interaction ***

 A while ago I came across  this answer  that introduced me to the obscure (at least for me)  **ISO 5218**
: a standard for representing human sexes  (or is it  **genders**
? - thanks @Paul). 
 For a pet project I'm working on I need my database schema to store the skin color of a person, and I'm wondering if a similar standard exists. All my life I've heard people using terms such as " **White**
", " **Caucasian**
", " **Black**
", " **Blonde**
", " **Brunette**
", " **Afro**
", " **Albino**
" and so on, but after some research in Wikipedia I've realized that everybody is wrong, because those words can all have different meanings: 
 
 White : yeah, it's a color 
 Caucasian : defines the race 
 Black : yet another color 
 Blonde : skin or hair color 
 Brunette : again, skin or hair color 
 Afro : "hairdo"?! 
 Albino : also represents more than the skin color 
 
 The  Wikipedia has the following about human races : 
 
 Caucasoid 
 Congoid 
 Capoid 
 Mongoloid 
 Australoid 
 
 **Seriously, Mongoloid?!**
 I don't know about the connotations of the English language but in my native language (Portuguese) that's a synonym for a person who suffers from the  Down syndrome disorder ... 
 This Wikipedia page  also has some interesting additional information: 
 
 Johann Friedrich Blumenbach
  (1752-1840), one of the founders of
  what some call scientific racism
  theories, came up with the five color
  typology for humans: white people (the
  Caucasian or white race), more or less
  black people (the Ethiopian or black
  race), yellow people (the Mongolian or
  yellow race), cinnamon-brown or flame
  colored people (the American or red
  race) and brown people (the Malay or
  brown race). 
 
 The problem with using races ( besides the horrific names chosen and scientific racism ), is that they don't necessarily represent the skin color of a person... Take the following  photo from Wikipedia : 
 
 The most serious attempt I could find to classify skin color is the  **Von Luschan's chromatic scale**
: 
 
 
 Most people however, are not aware of their von Luschan's scale (myself included). I also though of  **having the user visually specifying the color of their skin tone**
 but that could lead to some problems due to the different color profiles used by the operating systems / monitors. 
 There is also a more general von Luschan's scale used to classify sun tanning risk: 
 
 von Luschan  **1-5**
 (very light). 
 von Luschan  **6-10**
 (light). 
 von Luschan  **11-15**
 (intermediate). 
 von Luschan  **16-21**
 ("Mediterranean"). 
 von Luschan  **22-28**
 (dark or "brown"). 
 von Luschan  **29-36**
 (very dark or "black"). 
 
 Since this can become a very sensitive topic for some people I'm wondering what would be the best way to store this information in a normalized database. Is there a  **correct globally accepted standard to describe skin color**
 without affecting susceptibilities while using straightforward terms and avoiding complicated and unfamiliar definitions such as von Luschan's scale? 
 
 
 Similar standards exist for  eye  and  hair color .  **How would you approach the skin tone terminology?**

 
 I'd do something like the Nintendo Wii's  Mii Editor  and just show several swatches of colors. Even if the monitor isn't calibrated, if someone sees them all on the screen at once they should be able to make the correct choice. 
 
 
 You can then give the color an internal name and do your data mining on that. 
 
 olayforyou.com  defines these skin tones 
 alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/151ab0ddd7.jpg 
 
 very fair 
 fair 
 olive 
 dark 
 very dark 
 
 Any person using cosmetics regularly would understand these terms. These rest of us are just guessing :-) 
 
 You may wish to consider skin tones defined by cosmetic companies as these can be quite exact and even refer to tanning effects. 
 
 I  personally  wouldn't define a domain; let that be a textbox and everybody fills anything he/she wants. I prefer this way just because can be a polemic and potentially offensive subject,  like this . 
 **EDIT:**
 Or, what about doesn't display any names, but colors instead? Use that Von Luschan's scale and use a "Select your color: " label. You don't need to name it and can to define a domain into your database. 
 
 Despite monitor calibration issues, I think that the von Luschan chromatic scale along with the numbers and textual descriptions you have shown, is the best.  Sure it's a bit subjective, but so are all the alternatives. 
 Seeing the entire available range of selections, and visualizing very light and dark people, it's not to hard to come up with an estimate of where you lie on the scale. 
 Plus, the combination of numbers, colors, and words makes it easier to hone in on your approximate color. 
 **EDIT**
: 
 I do see that you have expressed doubts about using the chromatic scale in your post - I just thought you might consider these points.  People don't have to be familiar with the scale ahead of time to use it.  I've never seen it before but it makes perfect sense to me.
