 what are the popular nosql databases that are used from python ? i know there are a few options as explained at  http://nosql-database.org/  but what do python programmers use the most ? 
 thanks 
 
 Most of the nosql databases have python clients which are actively supported.  Pick your database based on your usage needs.  Using it from python shouldn't be a problem. 
To name a few: 
Cassandra:  https://github.com/datastax/python-driver 
Riak:  https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client 
MongoDB:  http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/ 
CouchDB:  http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Getting_started_with_Python 
Redis:  https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py   
 
 I like mongodb.  Basically you can just throw a dictionary into a database, which makes it very easy to use from python.  I haven't seen a consensus on one specific nosql database.  I would suggest trying a couple of them.  Redis is pretty neat and couchdb is in the mix.

 Be sure to take a look at  ZODB . It's an exceedingly easy-to-use, Python-based database that covers a large range of use cases and has been used in production environments for many years. 
 
 In addition to the standard NOSQL databases mentioned by Zanzon you might also try: 
 
 shelve , which is a document database provided as part of the python standard library, and uses  anydbm  as a backend. it supports anything that can be pickled. 
 shove , which is similar to  shelve  but with a wide choice of backends including dbm, ZODB, Redis, Mongo et al. 
 ZODB , which is part of the Zope framework - I'd recommend using this on its own only if you also use Zope. 
 
 I myself have recently started using shelve with a decent amount of success - the only caution I'd give you is that it does not play well with the default OSX version of python - in fact issues with low file size limits (hundreds of KiB) have been noted on 2.7.1<=python<=2.7.3 . I however have no issued on the brew version of python 2.7.5 
 
 I strongly recommend  DyBASE . It is not popular but it is an excellent Python object database before the NoSQL term existed. I answered a similar question at  List of Python Object Databases .
