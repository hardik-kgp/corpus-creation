 I recently came upon the term  **NewSQL**
. It seems that it can be used with  **SQL**
, maintain  **ACID**
 and still provide the  **performance**
 and  **scalability**
 of NoSQL.  **This sounds great!**

 I am wondering what are the pros and cons of NoSQL and NewSQL and why isn't NewSQL used more? Is it  only  because it is a new technology and it still lacks adoption and stable implementations?
