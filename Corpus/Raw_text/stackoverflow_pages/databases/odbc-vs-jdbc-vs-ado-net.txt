*** odbc-vs-jdbc-vs-ado-net ***

 What exactly are ODBC, JDBC and ADO.NET? What are the links between them? 
 
 These are all different data access technologies. 
 ODBC  is an (older) open standard.  It's designed to be database and technology neutral.  JDBC and ADO.NET can both actually use ODBC internally as a provider, if requested. 
 JDBC  is a similar concept, but designed to be a standard for Java. 
 ADO.NET  is a .NET data access technology. 
 
 ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a standard API that can be used to communicate with databases. 
 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java standard that can be used to communicate with databases. 
 ADO.Net is a .Net standard that can be used to communicate with databases. 
 Individual databases, such as SQL Server or MySQL, have drivers that implement each of these APIs.   
 In addition, there are ODBC implementations for JDBC and ADO.Net that allow them to use ODBC drivers.
