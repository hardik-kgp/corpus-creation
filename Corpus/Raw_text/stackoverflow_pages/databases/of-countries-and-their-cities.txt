 I need a database of Countries and their Cities. 
 Any idea where I can get such a list? 
 
 There are quite a few available. 
 The following has database for 2,401,039 cities 
 http://www.geodatasource.com/world-cities-database/free 
 
 From all my searching around, I strongly say that the most practical, accurate and free data source is provided by  GeoNames . 
 You can access their data in 2 ways: 
 
 The easy way through their free web services. 
 Import their free text files into Database tables and use the data in any way you wish. This method offers much greater flexibility and have found that this method is better. 
 
 
 Go through this link  http://www.maxmind.com/en/worldcities   
 It Includes the following fields: 
 
 Country Code 
 ASCII City Name 
 City Name 
 Region 
 Population 
 Latitude (The latitude and longitude are near the center of the most granular location value returned: postal code, city, region, or country) 
 Longitude

 Cities of the world database donated by MaxMind.com 
 The company MaxMind.com 1  has agreed to release their cities of the world database under the GPL. The database contains locations by country, city, latitude and longitude. There are over 3,047,000 records in the database. For those of you who have tried the location.module with the zipcodes database from CivicSpace, you will recognize how cool it is and how well this fits with that project and therefore Drupal.   
 Here's  another free one  that might help you get started. 
 Creating and maintaining such a database is quite a bit of work - so anyone who's done it is likely keeping it to themselves, or offering it for a fee.

 I was comparing worldcitiesdatabae.info with  www.worldcitiesdatabase.com  and it appears the latter one to be more resourceful. However, maxmind has a free database so then why buy a cities database. Just get the free one and there is lot of help available on internet about maxmind db. If you put in extra efforts then you can save those few bucks :)
