*** omitting-the-milliseconds-in-a-date ***

 When I select from SQL Server, I want to get a date, but omit the millisecond value, and I want it to be as a date type.  So if I have a value  , I want to omit the millisecond but retain the date type, so that it will be the value   (I know you really can't omit the millisecond value with a date, just want it to be zero). 
 Is there a function in SQL Server to do this?  Or do I have to write my own function?  Again, I don't want it as a   type, but a   type. 
 
 If you don't want to use string conversions, here's a solution: 
 
 
 Use  , a new datatype in SQL Server 2008 that supports fractional precision: 
 
 The conversion will round to the nearest unit, eg: 
 
 Alternatively, on SQL 2005 and eariler: 
 
 This is a bit faster than converting to and from a string representation. 
 
 Use: 
 
 This: 
 
 ...omits the milliseconds, returning a VARCHAR.  So you CAST/CONVERT that into a DATETIME in order to work with the desired data type. 
 See  this link for a list of various date/time formats you can work with . 
 
 try this 
 
 or with date functions only 
 
 
 
 
 Subtract millisecond from date. (Or add negative value of millisecond) 
 
 From  SQL Server remove milliseconds from datetime 
 
 
 May need to change the 0 to something else to prevent an overflow error. Don't have a SQL Server at hand right now to verify.  
 While this method does not appear to be intuitive at first sight, have a look here for the rationale behind it:  http://karaszi.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-datetime-datatypes
