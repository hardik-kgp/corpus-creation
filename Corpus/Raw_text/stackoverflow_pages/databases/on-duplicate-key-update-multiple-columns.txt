*** on-duplicate-key-update-multiple-columns ***

 When using  insert... on duplicate key update , what is the syntax to update multiple columns? 
 
 Update: I am using this within PHP. Since this is a syntax question, it very relevant. 
 
 Again, not sure about this last part with the "Update". 
 
 
 I fixed your quotes and tickmarks. 
 **Edit:**

 In PHP: 
 
 Note that the values are surrounded by single quotation marks  . If the values are a number type (INT, FLOAT, etc) you can drop those quotation marks. Backticks are optional around the column names as long as you are not using column names like  ,  , or  . 
 In the PHP example, string concatenation is used to clearly separate out the variables. 
 
 Well, this is old. But of course you only need to provide a value  once , there's no reason to add it a second time in the query (which comes in handy for multiple inserts, or prepared statements): 
 
 Which has as advantage it will still work for a multiple insert statement: 
 
 
 Your query seems to be correct.
Here is my example of this type of query: 
 
 
 For the sake of clear syntax there's another syntax form; 
 
 Example; 
 
 If there does not exist a customer with ID=10 in database it will be created and columns cid, createdon, createdby, cname will be set. If it does exist, then it will be updated and columns modifiedon, modifiedbym, cname will be updated. 
 NOTE#1: IF you put for primary key cid=0 here, it will fire AUTO_INCREMENT (of course, if pk column is defined as AUTO_INCREMENT) and a record will be inserted! 
 NOTE#2: ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE makes update for existing PK ID record. But also it makes update if DUPLICATE is made on any UNIQUE KEY column. For example, if you defined that cname column is UNIQUE, then saving record with cname='Steve' that already exist will result in UPDATE of that record (not new INSERT). Take care about this because you may expect that DB returns error for UNIQUE KEY constraint violation which will not happened here.
