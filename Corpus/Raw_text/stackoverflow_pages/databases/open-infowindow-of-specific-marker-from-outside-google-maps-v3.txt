*** open-infowindow-of-specific-marker-from-outside-google-maps-v3 ***

 I can't seem to get my head around this problem: 
 I've got a map with (a lot of) markers (companies) that come from a generated XML file. Below the map, I want to show a (non-JavaScript-generated) list of all the companies that are displayed on the map. When I would click a company in the list, the map would pan to that specific marker and open an infoWindow. The thing is that I want the map and the list to be two separate things...  
 What would be the right way to tackle this problem? Thanks! Important is that all markerinfo is dynamic...  
 
 Following the suggestions by Michal, I've tried the following, but am encountering two problems: my console tells me   and the first item in my list shows to be  . Can you please help? 
 
 
 You are on the right track. You just need to create a separate global array for your Marker objects and push all created markers to this array. When you write out all your company data to html include a call with the index of the marker executed on click. Below is an example code. I used JSON as my data structure to hold company info instead of XML.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Ok I added another solution for you - uising your code. This one uses your bindInfWindow function to bind the DOM (HTML) click event to open info window and scroll to marker. Please note that because you are loading companies dynamically the divs (or some other tags) that hold their names and ids must exist in the DOM BEFORE you start binding events to it - so the first function you need to execute is the one that renders companies HTML (not the map init). Please note I have not tested this one as I do not have your data..
