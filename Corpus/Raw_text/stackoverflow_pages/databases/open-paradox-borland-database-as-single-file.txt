*** open-paradox-borland-database-as-single-file ***

 my question is:
how to connect java tp paradox / borland database ".DB" single files? 
 Here's what I have:
 
So, it's Paradox 7 database files. 
 I'm trying drivers:
 http://www.hxtt.com/paradox.html  &  https://code.google.com/archive/p/paradoxdriver/  as: 
 
 But both throws exceptions like: 
 
 As you can see, it is trying to find some database folder, but I have only single files! Also, "jdbc:paradox:/D:/BABAK/powerGold" (path to all .DB files folder) didn't work as well. 
 So, anybody, please help me to figure out, how to open this type of DB in my Java app. 
 
  is the correct syntax. 
 One of the open source Paradox drivers you mentioned is  now on Github  and has had more features added since a couple of years ago, so that may now work. 
 If it doesn't, can you post the full stack trace (using this library, not the HXTT one) so we can figure out exactly what's going on? I'm not the original author, but I have made several contributions for different field types. 
 
 you're not trying to open the database doing so  but a  specific  file of the whole DB. In fact your DB is composed of files .db, .px ....   
 The best approach to do so, is to migrate since this  DB  is not supported, and realy brings a lot of bugs. 
 I will  recommand  you  to use migrate  your database. 
 
 install Paradox Database Reader or  Editor  
 export tables to CSV files 
 import tables in mysql Database (for  example)  
 
 If  you still  want to connect this DB without migration with  java, share in  private a file .db and  will give a try now. 
 
 To solve it do the following: 
 
 
 keep the same files .db and .px of SongTitle in the same directory then run your code and it will work
