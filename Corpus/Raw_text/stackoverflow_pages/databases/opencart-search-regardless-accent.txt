*** opencart-search-regardless-accent ***

 It had been written many times already that Opencart's basic search isn't good enough .. Well, I have came across this issue: 
 When customer searches product in my country (Slovakia (UTF8)) he probably won't use diacritics. So he/she writes down "cucoriedka" and found nothing.  
 But, there is product named "čučoriedka" in database and I want it to display too, since that's what he was looking for. 
 Do you have an idea how to get this work? The simple the better! 
 
 I'm ignorant of Slovak, I am sorry. But the Slovak collation   treats the Slovak letter   as distinct from  . (Do the surnames starting with  **Č**
 all come after those starting with  **C**
 in your telephone directories? They probably do. The creators of MySQL certainly think they do.) 
 The collation   treats   and   the same. Here's a sql fiddle demonstrating all this.  http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/46c0e/1/0 
 If you change the collation of the column containing your product name to  , you will get a more search-friendly table.  Suppose your table is called   and the column with the name in it is called  .  Then this SQL data-definition statement will convert the column as you require. You should look up the actual datatype of the column instead of using   as I have done in this example. 
 
 If you can't alter the table, then you can change your WHERE clause to work like this, specifying the collation explicitly. 
 
 But this will be slower to search than changing the column collation. 
 
 You can use   or   function of MySQL. 
 These functions compare phonetics. 
 Accuracy of soundex is doubtful for other than English. But, it can be improved if we use it like  
 
  can also be used. 
 Using combination of both   and   will improve accuracy.
