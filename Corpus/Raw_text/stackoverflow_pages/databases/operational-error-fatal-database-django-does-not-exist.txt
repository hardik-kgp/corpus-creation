*** operational-error-fatal-database-django-does-not-exist ***

 I'm a db dummy, and im trying to set up PostgreSQL for my django project. For that I also use psycopg2. Databases are complicated though. Personally I would like if there was a way to get hold of ALL my DATABASE- and USER-SETTINGS/INFO in one place. So I knew what connect to and how (I'm still running local so there's no security-issue with that?). 
 However it seems I don't have the "rights" to create this database, even though I connect to the standard "admin"-user "postgres". With the password i typed in under installation ("pw123"). 
 Django-project (settings.py): 
 
 CMD -> python manage.py shell (after importing django.db connection) 
 
 Have I done something wrong in the installation? Can I correct it? Should I consider reinstalling everything? How would I go about that? Databases are confusing me :P 
 
 PostgreSQL does not auto-create databases on first connection. You must create a database before you can use it. 
 Connect to PostgreSQL (usually to the administration database, named 'postgres'), via PgAdmin-III or the command-line   client, and create the database  . From PgAdmin-III you can do this via the menus; from   you use  the   SQL command . 
 See also  Creating a PostgreSQL database  in the manual and  this tutorial I found in a 5second google search that doesn't look totally wrong . 
 What I'd do is connect using   (you can find it in the Start menu) as the 'postgres' user, with the password you set at install time, then: 
 
 
 It's because unlike SQLite, you need to create the database, you can follow this guide  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn#step-seven-configure-postgresql 
 
 All you need to do is to create the database with name django in your postgresql. 
By default the user postgres will have privilege on database django and password will the password for user postgres.
