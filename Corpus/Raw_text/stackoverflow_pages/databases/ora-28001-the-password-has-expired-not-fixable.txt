*** ora-28001-the-password-has-expired-not-fixable ***

 I am facing a problem with my production database. The password expired and although I changed the password, it still says it is expired. Even stranger, I have a production web application and a development web application. Both of them access the same database. The production web application works perfectly, and with the development web application I always get: 
 
 I already logged into the server and did this: 
 
 Here's the information  requested by Jim : 
 
 
 Assuming the Oracle DB (should work for Oracle-XE's SAMPLE as well) is on Unix, ssh-in and : 
 
 
 I am 100% sure that my config is correct. I was overwriting all local data with the files from the productive app server. Still no success. 
 The problem is also this password expiry problem came suddenly while developing, so I am sure that I did not change anything. 
 However, I logged into the test system and reset the password there. My test system contains like 100 rows, my productive app like 1 million, so I can definitely tell you that I am on the right database.  
 After resetting the password of the test system, I can log-in again! So this whole story is very strange. Thanks for the support. 
 
 Can you post the results of the following?  Also, what version of Oracle are you using?  I'm assuming 11G? 
 
 I'd be curious to see what profile you're using, and what your settings are. 
 
 Even I was facing same problem. Issue got resolved after following these below mentioned steps, 
 
 Check to see if any of the accounts are expired 
 
 
 select username, profile, account_status, expiry_date from dba_users; 
 
 
 If no accounts are expired, you can skip to step 7 
 Dynamically create SQL that will unexpired the expired accounts.  You can unexpired the account by resetting the password.   NOTE: You will need to substitute {password} for the password you are using for your user. 
 
 
 select 'ALTER USER ' || username || ' identified by {password};' from
  dba_users where account_status like 'EXPIRED%' and username !=
  'XS$NULL'; 
 
 
 Execute the SQL generated in Step 3 
 Dynamically create SQL that will unlock the locked accounts. 
 
 
 select 'ALTER USER ' || username || ' account unlock;' from dba_users
  where  account_status like 'LOCKED%' and username != 'XS$NULL'; 
 
 
 Execute the SQL generated in Step 5 
 Modify the profile assigned to the accounts that you donâ€™t want to expire so the PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME is set to UNLIMITED.  This will keep them from expiring again.  In my case, I needed to update the DEFAULT profile. 
 
 
 alter profile DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME UNLIMITED ;

1.go to your command line interface.
2. then type sqlplus. 
 
 Just connect with SQLPlus and the affected user to your DB. SQLPlus will prompt you to change your password. 
 
 I did faced similar issue with Oracle of password expiry, to resolve this issue when I tried launching PLSQL, it's prompted me with user name /password and I entered the correct one but system throws me with password expiry error along with password reset input . After I reset my password I was able to connect to oracle database.  
 
 just execute this query: 
 
 commit; 
 
 The easy way, just do it :)
