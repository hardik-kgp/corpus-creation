*** oracle-changing-varchar2-column-to-clob ***

 I have an encountered an issue where the data I was trying to store in my varchar2(4000) column was too big, so I wish to change the column to one more suitable for storing large amounts of textual data. Specifically, a serialized array. 
 
 Firstly, is CLOB the best data type for me to use for this purpose? Is there a more appropriate data type? 
 Secondly, when I try to alter the column using the usual snyntax: 
 
 I get the following error:  **ORA-22858: invalid alteration of datatype**

 What's the most straightforward way to alter this table without losing any data? 
 
 
 The most straightforward way, given that the operation of moving from a   column to a   is disallowed, would be to create a new column and move the data from the old column to the new column: 
 
 
 The VARCHAR2 column cannot be directly converted to CLOB but it can be done in 2 steps: 
 
 Convert column datatype from VARCHAR2 to LONG. 
 Convert column datatype from LONG to CLOB.
