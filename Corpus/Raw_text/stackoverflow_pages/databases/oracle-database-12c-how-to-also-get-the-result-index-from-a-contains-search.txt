*** oracle-database-12c-how-to-also-get-the-result-index-from-a-contains-search ***

 I have a web service in Java that performs searches on an Oracle 12c Database. The problem is I have a   search: 
 
 but I also want to get the index(es) of the search word or phrase within the results. 
 Currently what I've tried is to take each of the returned search results and go through them performing a  **REGEX**
 search in Java to find the start and stop indexes needed to highlight the search result on the front end.  
 This works fine for regular text but if the requirement is that the user can search for  any random arrangement of any characters  (i.e. #<@(F#><)$*>/\./#&!)#}{}][s fdf) the Java search needs to also find that exact string and return the start and stop index.  
 I escape out any special characters for the Oracle search, but an entirely different set of rules is needed for the Java search to find the index. Trying to get them to match up has turned out to be a nightmare and typically the Java  **REGEX**
 search doesn't find the same occurrences that the Oracle Database search finds. I believe the approach I'm taking is totally wrong and there should be some simple way to also get the indexes of the occurrences of hte search word (or phrase).  
 **TL;DR:
When performing a **
** search, how could I **
**also**
** find the indexes of the search word or phrase within the returned search results using only an Oracle Database query (so I don't have to worry about losing search results to a REGEX mismatch)?**

 
 Perhaps you are looking for something like  REGEXP_INSTR() ?  It will return zero if no match, otherwise returns the position of the first character of (or the first character following) the matching substring. 
 
 
 Old question, but combining regexp_instr, and regexp_count as well as CONNECT BY LEVEL, I think you can get what you're looking for:
