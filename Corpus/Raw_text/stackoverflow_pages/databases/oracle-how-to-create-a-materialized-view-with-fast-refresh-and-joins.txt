*** oracle-how-to-create-a-materialized-view-with-fast-refresh-and-joins ***

 So I'm pretty sure Oracle supports this, so I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.  This code works: 
 
 If I add in a JOIN, it breaks: 
 
 Now I get the error: 
 ORA-12054: cannot set the ON COMMIT refresh attribute for the materialized view 
 I've created materialized view logs on both TPM_PROJECT and TPM_PROJECTVERSION.  TPM_PROJECT has a primary key of PROJECTID and TPM_PROJECTVERSION has a compound primary key of (PROJECTID,VERSIONID).  What's the trick to this?  I've been digging through Oracle manuals to no avail.  Thanks! 
 
 To start with, from the  Oracle Database Data Warehousing Guide : 
 
 **Restrictions on Fast Refresh on Materialized Views with Joins Only**

 ... 
 
 Rowids of all the tables in the FROM list must appear in the SELECT
  list of the query. 
 
 
 This means that your statement will need to look something like this: 
 
 Another key aspect to note is that your materialized view logs must be created as  . 
 Below is a functional test scenario: 
 
 
 Have you tried it without the ANSI join ? 
 
 
 You will get the error on REFRESH_FAST, if you do not create materialized view logs for the master table(s) the query is referring to. If anyone is not familiar with materialized views or using it for the first time, the better way is to use oracle sqldeveloper and graphically put in the options, and the errors also provide much better sense.  
 
 The key checks for FAST REFRESH includes the following: 
 
 No 3 is easy to miss and worth highlighting here
