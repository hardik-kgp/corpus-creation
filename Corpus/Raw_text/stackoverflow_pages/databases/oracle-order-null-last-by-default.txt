*** oracle-order-null-last-by-default ***

 Is there a way to set the  **default**
 order used by Oracle to be  NULL LAST  (or  NULL FIRST ), without have to put it in each query? 
 
 No, there is no way to change  the default behavior of   and  : 
 
 NULLS LAST is the default for ascending order, and NULLS FIRST is the
  default for descending order. 
 
 
 I can't prove it's impossible to change, but I cannot find such a feature in the places it is most likely to be implemented. 
 **SQL Option**
 The  manual  does not mention anything. 
 **Parameter**
 None of the nls parameters in   control it:  
 **Hidden Parameter**
 There's no  hidden parameter .  I tried searching for anything
like %null% or %sort%, none of them appear relevant. 
 **Locale Builder**
 Oracle allows you to  create your own custom sorting .  It
has a lot of options, but none of them allow you to define how NULLs are sorted.  Setting the Major Sort and Minor Sort numbers really high or low does not
change it (I was hoping that a NULL was implemented as a hard-coded small or large value).  You can set the sort order for 0x0000, which is "NULL", but that's a different type of NULL. 
 
 No, there is no way to enable default ordering without using   clause, which allows you put  s last or first. Here is an example: 
 
 Ascending ordering 
 
 Result: 
 
 Descending ordering 
 
 Result: 
 
 
 
 In ascending order, NULL values will always be sorted last
