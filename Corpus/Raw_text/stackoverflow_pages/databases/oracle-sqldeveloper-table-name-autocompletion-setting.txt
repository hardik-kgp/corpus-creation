*** oracle-sqldeveloper-table-name-autocompletion-setting ***

 I am using   version. Table Name autocompletion is not happening.  
 Checked in autocompletion settings but in vain. 
 Any ideas about it? 
 
 Go to:  
And make sure your settings are configured properly: 
 
 
 Though this post is old but still I see many people not able to get real  **Auto Complete**
 intellisense feature because as soon as  **Auto Complete values exceeds 10**
 then autocomplete doesn't work i.e you need to explicitly use  CTRL+SPACE  for displaying intellisense in that case.  
 Please follow the steps so that you will be not faced with this problem.  
 I'm using  SQL Developer 4.2  at time of this demo. If you have some issues in upgrading to this version of SQL Developer from the past then you need to also update your JDK to 1.8 or above.  
 Please follow steps below to ensure that SQL Developer Auto Completion (intellisense) works in ALL cases. 
 **Step 1:**
 Open SQL Developer and go to  **Tools -> Preferences**

 **Step 2:**
 Select  **Code Editor -> Completion Insight**
  
 **Step 3:**
 Ensure that you have following settings as shown in snapshot below 
 
 
 SQL-Developer probably cannot lookup the completion fast enough on your database and therefore doesn't show it. You can use   to try forcing it. 
 
 if nothing works, open a new worksheet. many a times that is the real problem. current worksheet has corrupted 
 
 CTRL-SPACE works, but only before the intellisense dropdown shows up. I had to increase the time delay before it shows up so that it doesn't show up until after 4 seconds. this way, I have 4 seconds to hit ctrl+space to autocomplete 
 
 In my case, Version 18.4.0.376 Build 376.1900, Ctrl-Shift completion was ignored every time I had  **any**
 worksheet statements (preceding the one I was trying to complete) that lacked a terminating semicolon or was not commented out. 
 
 Tool > Preferences > Editor  > AutoReplace check Enabled and Create Definition File. AutoReplace definition file format should be  **ssf = select * from**
  and enter one item per line etc.  for Version 8.0.1.1498
