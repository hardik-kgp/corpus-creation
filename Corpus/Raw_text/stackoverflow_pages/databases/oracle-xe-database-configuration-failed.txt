*** oracle-xe-database-configuration-failed ***

 I am trying to create an oracle xe database in my vps.  
 VPS OS : Cent OS. 
 When try to run 
 
 it throws an error Database confiration failed and to check the logs but logs just shows 
ORA-01034: ORACLE not available 
 Below is the history... 
 
 
 Add your servers name and IP to the /etc/hosts file 
 
 
 Then try again. 
 
 I had same issues. 
 I uninstalled oracle-xe. See  How to reconfigure Oracle 10g xe on Linux 
 Then followed  
 
 Everything went fine. 
 
 Ok the solution may sound weird but today i got the exactly same error while installing Oracle Xe on centos. I struggled a lot to find the answer but in the end the problem was the way i was installing the rpm.  
 Initailly i used the command  
 
 and somehow it was giving the same error which you are getting. 
 After that i tried  
 
 and it worked for me. Not very sure why will the "h" flag, which is the hash flag cause an issue but it worked for me.   
 
 I too faced the similar issue on Linux Mint 17.3. Fortunately, I found the solution sooner. The issue is simply that your shared memory file is not where Oracle expects it to be i.e. /dev/shm but you'd be having it at /run/shm with /dev/shm linking to it. 
 So, to resolve this issue, before configuring the database, you must perform the below steps in order 
 
 I have tested it, works perfect.

 After googling 'oracle sucks' in frustration over the lack of logging from the installation I managed to resolve the issue that caused the configuration to fail on a docker container running the Hortonworks HDP 2.6 Sandbox: 
 Oracle XE requires 1 Gb of shared memory and fails otherwise (I didn't try 512 mb) according to  https://blogs.oracle.com/oraclewebcentersuite/implement-oracle-database-xe-as-docker-containers . 
 
 change/add the line to: 
 
 Then reload the configuration by: 
 
 Keep in mind that if you later restart the docker container you might have to do 'mount -a' once more as it starts with the default set on the container ~ 65 mb. 
 Normally the failed configuration will have succeeded in creating a listener and you will have to kill this before rerunning configuration. 
 
 
 Lost a full day to this one as none of the other answers on this page worked for me (Ubuntu). 
Proper instructions where  here 
The main trick missing from other tutorials was to execute

 check the permissions for:  
 In my case these were set to   I changed this to   and it worked for me. 
 But before that I tried the following:  
 
 Setting up the   in the  
 installing bc and reinstalling oracle 
 
 both the steps did not work for me but I uninstalled and reinstalled oracle-xe, changed permissions and then ran the command for configure.
