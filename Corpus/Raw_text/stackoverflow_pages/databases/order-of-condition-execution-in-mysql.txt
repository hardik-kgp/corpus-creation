*** order-of-condition-execution-in-mysql ***

 Suppose I have a MySQL query with two conditions: 
 
 The first condition is obviously going to be a lot cheaper than the second, so I'd like to be sure that it runs first, limiting the pool of rows which will be compared with the LIKE clause. Do MySQL query conditions run in the order they're listed or, if not, is there a way to specify order? 
 
 MySQL has an internal query optimizer that takes care of such things in most cases.  So, typically, you don't need to worry about it.   
 But, of course, the query optimizer is not foolproof.  So... 
 Sorry to do this to you, but you'll want to get familiar with   if you suspect that a query may be running less efficiently than it should.

 The optimiser will evaluate the WHERE conditions in the order it sees fit. 
 SQL is  declarative : you tell the optimiser  what  you want, not  how  to do it. 
 In a  procedural/imperative  language (.net, Java, php etc) then you say  how  and would choose which condition is evaluated first. 
 Note: "left to right" does apply in certain expressions like   as you'd expect 
 
 If you have doubts about MySQL usage of index, you can suggest what index should be used.
