*** ormlite-and-images-saved-as-blob-on-android ***

 So I recently switched my database stuff over to ORMLite in my android tablet application I am writing.  So far so good, got most things refactored/recoded.  Though I am having issues to what was originally stored in the database as a BLOB.  In my original data model it looked like this: 
 
 but I don't think I can use that in ORMLite, best I could tell it has to be a string so now I have: 
 
 But now, I am confused as to how to read and write those data bits as bytes, etc...I was using code like this to ferry data to and from the database: 
 
 So now thats how I WAS saving the image, I am not sure how to do this if there are no BLOBS in the ORMLite and I have to use strings? 
 for completeness this is how i would display the image: 
 
 So what do i have to do to get these images in and out of the database, and is the field type of String correct for a "Blob" ? 
 
 You can indeed store   fields in ORMLite.  To quote the  manual about byte arrays : 
 
 Array of bytes (byte[]) persisted as SQL type VARBINARY. This is different from the DataType.SERIALIZABLE type which serializes an object as an array of bytes. 
 NOTE: Because of backwards compatibility, any fields that are of type byte[] must be specified as DataType.BYTE_ARRAY or DataType.SERIALIZABLE using the dataType field and will not be auto-detected. 
 
 So, to use byte[] you will need to specify the type of the data: 
 
 The trick is that ORMLite does not automatically detect the type of the   because of some backwards compatibility issues.
