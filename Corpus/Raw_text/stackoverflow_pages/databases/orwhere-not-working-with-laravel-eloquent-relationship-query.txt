*** orwhere-not-working-with-laravel-eloquent-relationship-query ***

 In Laravel, I have two tables named Booking and Clients. For a specific booking, I have belongsTo relation with a single Client. Everything works well when I query a client for a booking except when I include orWhere. Please look at the code snippet below. 
 
 With the commented out orWhere line, I get proper bookings with the client with   as specified by user. But when I use or in the query for  , all the rows are displayed as if   matched for every row. 
 What's wrong with it? Help please.
