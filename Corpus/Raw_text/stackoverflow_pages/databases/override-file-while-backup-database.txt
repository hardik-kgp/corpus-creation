*** override-file-while-backup-database ***

 I want to back up a database using this code 
 
 It works. But if the backup file already exists, the data gets appended to the file instead of replacing the file. Every time I call   the file gets bigger. 
 Is there an option for   to force a replace? 
 
 
 
  does the trick. From  MSDN :  
 
 INIT Specifies that all backup sets should be overwritten
