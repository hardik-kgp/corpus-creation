 I have a data frame with a column called   and want all the values from this column to have the same value (the year only). Example: 
 
 What I want is: 
 
 Here is my code: 
 
 It happens that in my DataFrames, called for example   the values of   can be anything (strings, integer, and so on), so maybe it would be best to completely erase this column and then attach another column with only the year to the DataFrames? 
 
 As @DSM points out, you can do this more directly using the  vectorised string methods : 
 
 Or using extract (assuming there is only one set of digits of length 4 somewhere in each string): 
 
 An alternative slightly more flexible way, might be to use   (or equivalently  ) to do this: 
 
 The lambda function, is taking the input from the   and converting it to a year. 
You could (and perhaps should) write this more verbosely as: 
 
 Perhaps 'Year' is a better name for this column... 
 
 You can do a column transformation by using    
 Define a clean function to remove the dollar and commas and convert your data to float. 
 
 Next, call it on your column like this. 
 
 
 Or if one want to use   function in the   function:
