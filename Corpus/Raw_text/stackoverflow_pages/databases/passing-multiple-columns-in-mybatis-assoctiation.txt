*** passing-multiple-columns-in-mybatis-assoctiation ***

 I want to know, how do we pass multiple columns in a myBatis association tag. 
 For example, I have the following xml snippet in one my mapper.xml file: 
 
 As you can see, the   with   subscription has only one column,  
 I want to pass 2 columns to it, and therefore the resultant code, how do we do that? 
 I tried the following combinations, none worked: 
 
 but if I pass single, 
    column="{course_id}" or column="course_id" 
 works without any issues. 
 Any idea guys? 
 
 You should use the following syntax for composite keys:  
 
 Where   are parameters of the associated query and   are sql columns passed to that query.  
 In your case: 
 **CourseMapper.xml**
:  
 
 **CourseSubscriptionMapper.xml**
:  
 
 I just checked it worked fine for me.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. 
 
 Multiple column names can be passed as key value pairs 
 
 For more info,
you can refer the  
 org.apache.ibatis.builder.MapperBuilderAssistant.parseCompositeColumnName(String).columnName -- API which parses the meta-data of @Result.column()
