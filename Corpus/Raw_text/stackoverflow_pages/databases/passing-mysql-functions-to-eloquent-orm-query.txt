*** passing-mysql-functions-to-eloquent-orm-query ***

 I am trying to execute the following query in Eloquent ORM and cannot seem to execute the MySQL function -  
 
 The exception I am getting is as follows - 
Message: 
 
 So, basically, it is encapsulating the   MySQL function as a column. Is there any way to do this without using a raw query? 
 
 You probably don't want to use the   function in your WHERE clause anyway.  This would prevent you from using any index on the   column.  I would suggest you use   instead: 
 
 You can also just use raw SQL queries as well (using   method) if you had need to utilize unsupported MySQL functions in your queries. 
 
 To prevent Eloquent ORM from wrapping first variable with apostrophes, you can use   function like: 
 
 And you'll get query: 
 
 
 You have two ways to do this and its depend on your laravel version  
 First use  **Raw**
 method to pass function as below example 
 
 ِAlso you can use it in (select,group,order) Methods, for more information about Raw  Laravel Docs  its start from v 4.2 
 Second use  **whereYear**
 Method 
 
 This method start from V 5.3 for more information  Read Where section   you will found all methods for dates (whereDate / whereMonth / whereDay / whereYear) 
 
 I use Laravel 5.3
