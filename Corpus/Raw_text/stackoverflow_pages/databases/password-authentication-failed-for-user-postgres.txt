 I have installed PostgreSQL server 8.4 on my CentOS server sucessfully.
After that, I login to CentOS server by using 'postgres' user, but I can not run any command, the error occur: 
 
 password authentication failed for user "postgres" 
 
 Here is some configurations in pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf: 
 
 
 I tend to use the following in pg_hba.conf: 
 
 That means that once you're "postgres", you don't need a password, but you need sudo rights to become postgres, so that's pretty darn secure. Any other user can login using simple md5 authentication, which means you don't have to sudo all over the place. This works well for me. 
 
 Ensure you use the password of the postgres PostgreSQL account, not the postgres system account. Try "trust" instead of "md5" in the pg_hba.conf to connect to the db an change your pass. 
 
 I met a similar problem (the same error message). Like Daniel answer, it's because that I confuse between : 
 
 "postgres PostgreSQL account, not the postgres system account." 
 
 To be sure about the postgres password, just change it to '123456' (or any other password)
