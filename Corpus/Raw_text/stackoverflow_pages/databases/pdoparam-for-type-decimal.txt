*** pdoparam-for-type-decimal ***

 I have 2 database fields 
 
 I have 2 pdo queries that update them. The one that updates the int works ok 
 
 but I can't update the decimal field. I've tried the 3 ways below, but nothing works 
 
 It seems the problem is with the database type  ? Is there a   for a field of type  ? If not, what do I use as a workaround? 
 
 There isn't any   for decimals / floats, you'll have to use  . 
 
 UP must use the PDO::PARAM_STR same, and noting that if the column in the database is of type NUMERIC (M, D) or decimal (M, D) should be observed that the M is the number of characters precision should be the total of characters that you can enter, and D the number of decimal places. In the example NUMERIC (10,2) we have 8 houses to places of accuracy and two decimal places. So we have 10 characters in total with 2 reserved for decimal places. 
 
 I found a solution, send the decimal parameter like PDO::PARAM_STR, in the sql server store procedure receive it like decimal(int,dec) 
 PHP 
 
 SQL SERVER, STORE PROCEDURE: 
 
 and is done.
