*** persist-security-info-property-true-and-persist-security-info-property-false ***

 For the properties: 
 
 and 
 
 Can you tell me what is the difference between them, and if I don't put it in my connection what will happen? 
 
 
 Even if you set   OR  
it won't show a difference in front..The difference is happening at background 
 When   security-sensitive
information, such as the password, is not returned as part of the
connection if the connection is open or has ever been in an open
state. 
 If you set  , Windows will remember the password specified in the connection string. 
 Thats the difference. 
 MSDN Explanation 
 setting   true or false will come into effect only if you mention username and password in connection string. If you mention username and password in connectionstring and set   as   then the credentials cannot be extracted. but if you set   as true while giving credentials in the connectionstring windows will remember the credentials and it can extracted in program 
 
 I found this answer  here  from Dan Guzman, SQL Server MVP: 
 
 I suggest you specify FALSE or omit the keyword entirely since it is
  the default, even during development.  The only time you need to
  specify TRUE is if the application uses SQL authentication and
  subsequently retrieves the password from the connection object, which
  in my experience is rarely done or needed.  Performance is not a
  concern.
