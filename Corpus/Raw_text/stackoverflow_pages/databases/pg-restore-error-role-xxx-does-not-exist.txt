*** pg-restore-error-role-xxx-does-not-exist ***

 Trying to replicate a database from one system to another. The versions involved are 9.5.0 (source) and 9.5.2 (target).  
 Source db name is   with owner   and target db name will be named   with owner  . 
 All commands are run on the target system that will host the replica. 
 The   command is: 
 
 This runs without errors.

 that try to set privileges for user   who of course doesn't even exist as a user on the target system which only has user  , and thus the errors from  . 
 On the source db the privileges for example of the   table: 
 
 A quick solution would be to simply add a user   on the target cluster and be done with it.  
 But shouldn't the   take care of not including owner specific commands in the dump in the first place? 
 
 I realized the   is not the same as the  . I added the   to all   commands, which means: 
 
 which in effect excludes the offending  /  commands from the dump. Problem resolved.
