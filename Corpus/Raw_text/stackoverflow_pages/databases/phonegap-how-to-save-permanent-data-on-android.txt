*** phonegap-how-to-save-permanent-data-on-android ***

 I'm looking for a method to save data permanently using  . 
 
 
 File I/O 
 ? 
 
 I heard   is not 100% permanent, but is somewhere in the alley. 
 I wouldn't really like to begin with File I/O, because what I need is to create a database with recipes, and they need to stay. 
 "Number 3" is what I'm asking about. Any suggestions? 
 Thanks in advance :) 
 
 I'm using the localstorage and this is the best solution to keep saved data. Like you said, it isn't 100% permanent. In my case the localstorage is cleared only if you uninstall the app. Find more info about localstorage with Phonegap
 http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.1.0/cordova_storage_storage.md.html#localStorage 
 You could get more info about localstorage on
 http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html 
 You could use a database as well. You can find info on this at
 http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.1.0/cordova_storage_storage.md.html#openDatabase 
 
 If you would like to store the data on the device permanently  **even after the app in uninstalled**
, you will have to do it in a different way on iOS and android. 
 On  **iOS**
 you can use the keychain  https://github.com/shazron/KeychainPlugin . 
 On  **Android**
 you can use the file plugin, and store the data on the SD card (cordova.file.externalRootDirectory).  
 In both cases, the data will remain on the device even if the user re-installs the app. 
 If you are using ionic (or just angular), you can use  ng-persist  that wraps these two plugins in an angular service with the same API for both ios and android.

 You could do the following steps for saving any data permanently, 
 
 Your HTML file 
 
 
 
 You JS file 
 
 
 
 In AppStore, when you release new version of your app, all of stored datas on your users will be reset. Before you update your app, you need to find better way to store your data.
