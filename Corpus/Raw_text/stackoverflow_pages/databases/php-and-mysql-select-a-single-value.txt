*** php-and-mysql-select-a-single-value ***

 I'd like to know how to select a single value from my MySQL table. The table includes columns   and   amongst others (  is auto-increment and   is unique). Given the username, I want to set a session variable   equal to the value in the   column that corresponds to the given username. Here's the code that I've already tried:  
 
 So far I'm getting: 
 
 Catchable fatal error: Object of class stdClass could not be converted to string. 
 
 Casting   to type string does not fix the problem. 
 
 1) Don't use quotation in a field name or table name inside the query. 
 2) After fetching an object you need to access object attributes/properties (in your case id) by attributes/properties name.  
 **It should work**

 Bonus tips: Use limit 1 for this type of scenario, it will save execution time :) 
 
 One note:  **please use mysqli_* or PDO since mysql_* deprecated.**

 
 The mysql_* functions are deprecated and unsafe.  The code in your question in vulnerable to  injection attacks .  It is  **highly**
 recommended that you use the PDO extension instead, like so: 
 
 Where   is your PDO object variable. See  https://www.php.net/pdo_mysql  for more information about PHP and PDO. 
 **For extra help:**

 Here's a jumpstart on how to connect to your database using PDO: 
 
 
 You do this by using   method. 
 
 Note: you can do that by using   method as well, but it will be deprecated in php v5.5 
 
 When you use  , you get an object (of class stdClass) with all fields for the row inside of it.  
 Use   instead of  , that will give you the first field of the result set (  in your case). The docs are  here 
 
 Try this 
 
 
 It is quite evident that there is only a single   corresponding to a single   because   is unique. 
 But the actual problem lies in the query itself- 
 
 **O/P**

 
 **i.e. **
** actually is treated as a string not as the **
** attribute.**

 **Correct synatx:**

 
 i.e. use  **grave accent**
(`) instead of  **single quote**
('). 
 **or**

 
 **Complete code**

 
 
 try this 
 
 
  extension has been deprecated in 2013 and removed completely from PHP in 2018. You have two alternatives  PDO  or  MySQLi .  
 **PDO**

 The simpler option is PDO which has a neat helper function  :  
 
 Proper PDO tutorial 
 **MySQLi**

 You can do the same with MySQLi, but it is more complicated:   
 
  could return NULL if there are no rows returned from the DB, which is why I check with ternary if there was any data returned.  
 
 This is a correct old version. 
 From documentation correct. 
 
 Have fun.
