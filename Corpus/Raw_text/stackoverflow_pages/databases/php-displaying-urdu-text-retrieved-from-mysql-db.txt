*** php-displaying-urdu-text-retrieved-from-mysql-db ***

 There are book titles in Urdu language stored in MySQL database. I've to display on html page using PHP.  
 Currently only questions marks( ) are displayed in place of Urdu text.  
 
 What needs to be done to display these characters properly? 
 
 Step : 1 - Go to table structure and change collation  **latin1_swedish_ci**
 to  **utf8_general_ci**

 Step : 2 -
You have to include this following tag in data results pages. 
 
 Step :3 - Insert 'N' Prefix. Here the N stands for National language character set. Which means that you are passing an NCHAR, NVARCHAR or NTEXT value,  more 
 Step :4 - PHP code displaying records form database. Before that you have to specify mysql_query() function data character set type 
 
 
 Also your files encoding mustbe utf-8 without BOM  
 
 I had faced this problem and i have solved this error by convert them to UTF-8.
