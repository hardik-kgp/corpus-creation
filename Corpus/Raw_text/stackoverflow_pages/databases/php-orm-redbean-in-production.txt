*** php-orm-redbean-in-production ***

 I would like to know how many of you are using RedBean ORM in your php production sites and what is your experience with it (reliability, speed, problems (if any),...)? 
 Thank You. 
 
 I wrote RedBean because I was dissappointed in Doctrine. I have used both Propel and Doctrine but I felt unproductive. 
 We use RedBean for several projects and it performs well. Actually RedBean is not a really 'fat' orm layer, so it's quite easy to optimize (almost all SQL is stored in one class; the query writer). It does not have a query parser, a customized SQL language or a query builder. If you want to improve performance even more you can decide to use plain SQL instead and use the convertToBeans-option afterwards. 
 
 Heej,
I am using it in an website I am working on. I have integrated it with CodeIgniter and it works perfect. I haven't anything I couldn't do with it.
