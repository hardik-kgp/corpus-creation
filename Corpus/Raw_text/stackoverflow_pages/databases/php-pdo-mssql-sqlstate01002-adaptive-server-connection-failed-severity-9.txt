*** php-pdo-mssql-sqlstate01002-adaptive-server-connection-failed-severity-9 ***

 I'm connecting to external MSSQL database for exports from PHP55/osx and I have wierd issue. 
 **code:**

 
 **throws:**
  
 
 but connection from CLI works correcty 
 **tsql -S hostname -U user -P pass -L dbname:**

 
 **freetds.conf:**

 
 **tsql -C:**

 
 Any ideas? I have tried alomost anything, connect to hostname, ip, with and without port, to instance name, another user, TDS versions 7.0,7.1,7.2,8.0, reinstall php and freetds 
 
 Check these: 
 
 locate freetds.conf on your disk. It is possible it exists in several places and tsql uses one while PHP used another one. Best is to symlink them into one common file and test on that. Note that a common place for that file is ~/.freetds.conf beside /etc/ or /usr/local/etc/ 
 there should be a [global] section on your freetds.conf file. Put there these lines : 
 tds version = 8.0 
 text size = 20971520 
 client charset = UTF-8 
 
 Of course, I expect that you already checked which driver is loaded by PHP with phpinfo(): mssql, sqlsrv or dblib 
 
 This is the generic failure message. You cannot connect to the database for whatever reason. Given you use OSX and brew most likely the problem lies in linking/loading the shared library. FreeTDS  is based on Sybase 8 (as is MS SQL Server). It is a bit arcane to compile with. 
 Was your PHP linked against the libsybdb.dylib that brew installs? 
You should be able to find out using phpinfo() if this is included in your server: 
 Configure Command '--with-pdo-dblib=shared,/usr/local/Cellar/freetds/0.91/lib'  
 To get it to work you need to compile/build your PHP with the dblib option. 
 
 My solution: 
 Get FreeTds 
 
 
 copy everything in the lib/ folder of your freetds installation into the lib/ folder of your PHP installation directory, replacing the old versions of:  libct.4.dylib ,  libct.a ,  libct.dylib ,  libsybdb.5.dylib ,  libsybdb.a ,  libsybdb.dylib 
 
 Compile and install the dblib extension 
 
 download the php source for whatever php version you have installed 
 navigate to the   subfolder of the source 
 run  , making sure it is the correct binary for your installation 
 run the configure command with e.g. parameters:
 
 run  
 copy   into your PHP installation directory, replacing the old version
