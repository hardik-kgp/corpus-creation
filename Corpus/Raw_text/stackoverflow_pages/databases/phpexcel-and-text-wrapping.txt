*** phpexcel-and-text-wrapping ***

 I know that this line of code will make the cell text-wrap: 
 
 'D1' being the chosen cell. 
 Instead of using this code for every cell I need wrapped, is there a way to make the entire Excel Worksheet automatically wrap everything? 
 Or is there a better practice technique to use for specified columns?
