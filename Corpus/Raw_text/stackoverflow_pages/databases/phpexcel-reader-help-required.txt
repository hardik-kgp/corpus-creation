 I m using  PHPExcel  to read data from Excel sheet and store in mysql table, till now i m able to upload .xls  as well as .xlsx file and after uploading the xls i got below table structure of data 
 
 now i have some problems, please suggest me the optimized method  
 
 how do we get the sheet name ( bcoz in one excel there are 7 sheets ) 
 for now what i do to store these
data into db, below is the code snippet 
 
 
 and this returns 
 
 i need  that    
 
 header of each excel sheet (i.e. first row) become key of array($arr_data) and    
 rest become the value of array.   
 time changed into some integer value, that shoud be same as in  excel sheet   
 blank field ( i.e.blank header column ) of array in all row should be truncated (here [4]  )   
 if first field of an excel sheet (or combined condition on some
fields) is not fulfilled then that row should not be added into array   
 
 i.e. desired array should look like    
 
 and after that i store data into my db using mysql action on desired array. 
 
 is there any other short method to store above data in db  
 
 **Note: Please do not refer manual( it is really really very bad )... just tell me the methods name..**

 @Mark Thanks for your solution, it helps me a lot, but still some problems are there

 To get the current active sheet: 
 
 
 time changed into some integer value,
  that shoud be same as in excel sheet 
 
 Look at PHPExcel_Shared_Date::ExcelToPHP($excelDate) or PHPExcel_Shared_Date::ExcelToPHPObject($excelDate) to convert the date/time values to a PHP timestamp or DateTime object 
 Have a look at the $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->toArray() method rather than looping through all the rwos and columns yourself. If you want to use toArray with the formatted argument though, don't use $objReader->setReadDataOnly(true); otherwise PHPExcel can't distinguish between a number and a date/time. The latest SVN code has added a rangeToArray() method to the worksheet object, which allows you to read a row (or block of cells) at a time, e.g. $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->rangeToArray('A1:A4') 
 The rest of your questions are basically PHP array manipulation 
 **EDIT**

 PS. Instead of just telling us that the manual is really really very bad... tell us how we can improve it. 
 **EDIT 2**

 Using the latest SVN code to take advantage of the rangeToArray() method:
