*** phpmyadmin-automatic-logout-time ***

 How can I change the phpmyadmin automatic log out time? 
 It will log out automatically after 1440 seconds which is very low for me.  How can I change the option or remove log in request completely? 
 
 Create or edit your   file and set this variable value in it:  
   
 The integer is in seconds.  500000 seconds is 5.7 days.  Then restart apache. 
 
 Changing php.ini will change the session duration for all the websites running on the server. To change it just for PhpMyAdmin, open   and add: 
 
 
 In PHPMyAdmin 4 this no longer appears in the config.inc.php file. Instead go to PHPMyAdmin in your browser. Ensure you are at the localhost level to see the Settings link. Then set Settings > Features > Change the value of 'Login cookie validity' > Save 
 
 
 You can change the cookie time session feature at phpmyadmin web interface 
 
 OR 
 If you want to change the 'login cookie validity' in configuration file, then open the phpmMyAdmin configuration file,   in the root directory of PHPMyAdmin.(root directory is usually /etc/phpmyadmin/) 
 After locating the config.inc.php , search for the line below and set it to the value of seconds you want phpmyadmin to timeout: 
 
 If you couldn't find the above line, just add the following: 
 
 For example: 
 
 The Timeout is set to 3 Hours from the Example above. 
  might limit session validity and if the session is lost, the login cookie is also invalidated. So, we may need to set the session.gc_maxlifetime in   configuration file(file location is  /etc/php5 /apache2/php.ini in ubuntu).   
 
 
 **phpMyAdmin Documentation on LoginCookieValidity**
  
 $cfg['LoginCookieValidity'] 
 Type:    integer [number of seconds] 
Default value:   1440 
 Define how long a login cookie is valid. Please note that php configuration option session.gc_maxlifetime might limit session validity and if the session is lost, the login cookie is also invalidated. So it is a good idea to set session.gc_maxlifetime at least to the same value of $cfg['LoginCookieValidity']. 
 NOTE: 
 
 If your server crashed and cannot load your phpmyadmin page, check
your apache log at /var/log/apache2/error.log. If you got   on line 135, then do
a  . that should take care of the error. 
 If you get the warning:  , then change the  
as mentioned above. 
 
 
 For LOCAL installs only, you can remove the login and timeout altogether - this seems to be what you're after. By changing the authorization type to "config" and entering your database username and password in your config file you are automatically logged in. Add to  : 
 
 Of-course if you do this on a server on the internet, some cheeky chappy will come along and gleefully download all your passwords and delete your website. This is for a development server running on your own laptop only. 
 An easier way to customise phpmyadmin these days is to go to  http://www.example.com/phpmyadmin/setup/  , save all your settings section at a time, click save or download at the bottom, copy the file generated to your root phpmyadmin directory, then chmod it. You have to turn off write permission even if it is a local server as phpmyadmin checks this before it lets yo log in. 
 
 Explore directory 'apps\phpmyadmin4.5.2' in your wamp folder and open config.inc.php file. Then add this line under existing  code. 
 
 That's all...
