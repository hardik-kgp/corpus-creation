*** phpmyadmin-enable-drop-database-statement ***

 I was alerted by my hosting provider that I exceed my 1000 table limit. I have a lot of databases and would like to delete more at once. Unfortunaltley they don't have a multiselect feature so I decided to use a query in phpmyadmin. 
 When I try something like   I get  
 Does anyone know if it's possible to enable them or a different way to delete multiple databases? 
 
 It looks like there is a  phpMyAdmin setting  that you need to edit in config.inc.php. 
 
 **boolean $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] (line 503)**

 show a 'Drop database' link to normal users 
 
 
 Yes, you can do it with the following steps: 
 
 Go to wamp/apps/phpmyadmin3.5.1/libraries 
 Open the file called "config.default.php" 
 Go to line 653 and change   to  true 
 Restart the server to see the changes 
 
 **For Windows XP users**
: if the effect is not reflected, exit WAMP through the quick launch icon and try restarting it. 
 
 **Without touching any config files**

 If you have your phpmyadmin open, on the left side you'll see a database icon right next to your home icon( if you mouse over it - 'query window' title will pop up ), click on it and the window showed will allow you to enter the 'drop query' without touching any config files( at least i had no problems, hope it will help ). 
 
 
 you will need to update file   generally phpmyadmin's libraries folder 
 line 653 (may very depending on version)  
 
 
 
 Go to -> your_drive/xampp/PhpMyAdmin/libraries/ (Windows with XAMPP) or /usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/ (Linux with PHP/Apache/MySQL/PhpMyAdmin) 
 Open a file name “config.default.php“ 
 Find $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] 
 You will find the value is “False. Make it to  ”True”.  
 Linux restart apache2 in termina /etc/init.d/apache2 restart (Linux) or XAMPP Control Panel restart Mysql 
 
 
 PhpMyAdmin throws error “DROP DATABASE” statement is disabled”. “DROP” tab is missing in PhpMyadmin Home page. To Enable above tab in PhpMyAdmin follow below procedure. 
 
 Go to XAMPP directory—–>PhpMyAdmin—–>libraries/ folder. 
 Open/Edit file with name “config.default.php” 
 Find $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] 
 You will find it’s value is ‘False’, Make it “True” and you’re done. 
 Refresh PhpMyAdmin Page or Restart MySql server and then open PhpMyAdmin. 
 
 
 **I was able to do without modifying any of the above mentioned files**
. 
 Step 1  
 click on the database icon next to home icon
 
 Step 2 
 on the right side of the screen select the operations tab
 
 Step 3
Select the drop the database option and it should work[for me it worked even with the tables containing data 
 
 
 Drop the database and create a new one. To do so, go to phpmyadmin and select the database over the left panel. Then Go to 'Operations' tab on the head. Find the option to Remove Database at middle right. Click on DROP DATABASE and way to go... 
 
 did you try deleting the database by logging in to mySQL using SSH if you have not already.. 
 
 sudo mysql -u yourmysqlusername -p  (enter the password
  when prompted.) 
 mysql> SHOW DATABASES; (find your database)  
 mysql> USE YOURDATABSETODROP; (CHANGE THE DATABASE)  
 mysql> DROP DATABASE YOURDATABSETODROP; (and you are done.) 
 
 
 
 Yes, you can do it with the following steps: 
  1. Go to wamp/apps/phpmyadmin3.5.1/libraries 
  2. Open the file called "config.default.php" 
  3. Go to line 653 and change $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] = false; to true 
 4.Restart the server to see the changes 
 
 Restart the wamp  ...Close wamp server and open again. :) 
 Enjoy! 
 
 If this happened on a MAC, the chances are you are not running within an administrator's account; you don't have permission to delete the directory. 
 
 In your finder menu bar click "go" and type the following:  **usr/local/mysql/data**

 Select/delete the directory with the same database you want to drop - you will likely get the dialog asking for the admin username and password to continue. 
 After you enter the admin credentials, the directory will be gone. Restart your session with the database and you will be good to go. 
 
 Hope this helps 
 
 if you are using version 4+ then you can simply drop a database just following these steps: 
 
 go to mysql admin 
 click database option (right side of your databases) 
 here you will get all the databases you have and now click the checkbox at the left   side of the databases you want to delete 
 just the bottom of these databases you can see the option "Drop" so click the drop to delete the database permanently 
 
 
 I had to use another icon in CPanel (Databases section / MySqlDatabases) instead of (Databases Section / phpMyAdmin). 
 (... since my shared web-host provider disables the DROP DATABASE command, and initially limits access to command line and config files.) 
 
 
 select the database in phpadmin 
 click the operations button 
 show the remove database section 
 click the Drop the database(DROP). It show the alert box. 
 click OK.  
 
 
 I had problems with most of these approaches. 
 My installation is hosted so I don't have access to the PHP config files and the PHPMyAdmin interface is not displaying the "Remove Database" section mentioned above (under the Operations Tab).  The icon in the corner didn't work either. 
 What I realised you can do is create a stored procedure to delete your table. 
 Go to "Routines", "Add Routine" and create a stored procedure with the single line: 
 
 When that's created you can execute it and the database will get deleted.  
 
 Go to \wamp\apps\phpmyadmin4.1.14\libraries
Open the file called "config.default.php"
Go to line 653 and change $cfg['AllowUserDropDatabase'] = false; to true
Restart the server to see the changes 
 
 Go to the left sidebar of phpmyadmin where there is a listing of your databases and select the specific database that you want to delete. 
Having done that under the menu bar where there are several options such as  query ,  sql ,  operations , etc choose  structure . 
When you do that it will give you a listing of all the tables of the DB and right below the tables there is a checkbox choose  check all  and on the dropdown after that choose drop.
