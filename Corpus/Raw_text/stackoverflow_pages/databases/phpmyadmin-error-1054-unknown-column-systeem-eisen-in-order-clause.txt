*** phpmyadmin-error-1054-unknown-column-systeem-eisen-in-order-clause ***

 Yesterday I removed a column called 'systeem_eisen' from a table.
Now when I click in phpMyAdmin at the table 'products' I get the error message: 
 
I can't open the table 'products'. But my website still works(he used also the table 'products'). 
 But when I export the table 'products' and I watch the code I see nowhere the word 'systeem_eisen'. 
 Can someone help me, 
 Thanks in advange. 
 
 For me the only way was to set the order to an existing column under the search options:
 
 
 Goto  **phpmyadmin**
 database you will see the  **pma_table_uiprefs**
.  It stores thoses "cached" preferences and you could delete or edit them. 
 
 It works. 
I have insert the column back, then I change the standard sql when you click at explore in phpMyAdmin. 
 When I removed the column, there are no errors.
Yay! 
 
 I ran into this same issue and none of these suggestions worked for me. The cause in my case was that phpmyadmin had a sort for the altered/dropped column and I needed to fix it. Here is what resolved it for me. 
 In phpmyadmin, select your database in the left navigation pane. You will see all your tables, and in this case we are interested in  . Once you've found the table click on  . 
 
 You'll now see all the columns in the table. All you should need to do is remove the sort or change it accordingly. 
 
 
 You should now be able to open your table. 
 
 I just refreshed the page and it worked.  
 
 I got this error when I tried to see records with PHPMyAdmin but I could see structure the table. In my case, it was because the table didn't have any primary key.  
 
 the problem with was not able to insert crated_at and updated_at 
 but when i inert them one by one it works and the problem was because of having underscore in my table name '_'  https://sourceforge.net/p/phpmyadmin/bugs/4208/
