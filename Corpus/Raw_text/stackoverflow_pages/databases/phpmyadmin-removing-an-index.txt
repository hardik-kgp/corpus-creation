*** phpmyadmin-removing-an-index ***

 I have a column in one of my tables which has been assigned an index. It is preventing me from having two of the same ID number.  
 I am assuming the reason it is not letting me have two entries of the same ID is because it has been set to be Unique. 
 I am wondering how do I remove this rule so that I can insert the same ID number several times. 
 Cheers 
 
 below the list of your "columns" in the table structure you have a small table called "Indexes". Every row is an index. Find there your unique index and drop it using "drop" symbol (red X). If you have it on more than one column then drop it and recreate without the column you don't want unique 
 
 Follow this steps:- 
 
 Click  **Structure**
 tab of table. 
 Click  **Index**
(below the table). 
 Click  **Drop**
 for remove index(s). 
 
 
 
 In the tab structure below the table the indexes are listed. In some versions of PHPMyAdmin the index are listed only if you click on "+Indexes" which is easy to overlook. 
 
 ALTER TABLE  .  DROP INDEX
