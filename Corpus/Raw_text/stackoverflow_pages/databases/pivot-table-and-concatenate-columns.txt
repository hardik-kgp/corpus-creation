*** pivot-table-and-concatenate-columns ***

 I have a database in the following format: 
 
 Can I use SQL to convert it into this: 
 
 So, the  ,   are concatenated into new columns and   is summed where the   and   match. 
 Any tips would be appreciated. Is this possible in SQL or should I program it manually? 
 The database is SQL Server 2005.  
 Assume there are 100s of   and   so and 'A' and 'Z' shouldn't be hard coded but generated dynamically. 
 
 SQL Server 2005 offers a very useful PIVOT and UNPIVOT operator which allow you to make this code maintenance-free using PIVOT and some code generation/dynamic SQL 
 
 
 
 You change requirements more than our marketing team!  If you want it to be dynamic you'll need to fall back on a sproc.
