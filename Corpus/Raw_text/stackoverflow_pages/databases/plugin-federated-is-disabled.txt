*** plugin-federated-is-disabled ***

 Im trying to start MySQL using easyPHP: the response is an alert window to a log file. The main error is  <-- Plugin 'FEDERATED' is disabled --> . 
 Through research online I found that the solution is to add the federated option to the   file. I did this, but it is still not working. 
 Here is an extract from the log file for more information: 
 
 
 The message about FEDERATED disabled is not an error. It just meant that the FEDERATED engine its not ON for your mysql server. It's not used by default. If you don't need it, don't care about this message. 
 
 The  **FEDERATED**
 storage engine is available beginning with MySQL 5.0.3. It is a storage engine that accesses data in tables of remote databases rather than in local tables.
