*** populate-treeview-from-database ***

 I have a database table (named Topics) which includes these fields : 
 
 topicId  
 name 
 parentId 
 
 and by using them I wanna populate a TreeView in c#. How can I do that ? 
 Thanks in advance... 
 
 It will probably be something like this. Give some more detail as to what exactly you want to do if you need more.  
 
 
 Not quite. 
 Trees are usually handled best by not loading everything you can at once.  So you need to get the root node (or topic) which has no parentIDs.  Then add them to the trees root node and then for each node you add you need to get its children. 
 
 
 this code runs perfectly for me, check it out i think it will help you :)

 When there are no Large Amounts of Data then it is not good to connect database, fetch data and add to treeview node again and again for child/sub nodes. It can be done in single attempt. See following sample:

 This code runs perfectly for me. Thought it might be useful for somebody looking to display hierarchial data in a treeview.By far, i guess this is the simplest. Please check it out and upvote if it helps you.
