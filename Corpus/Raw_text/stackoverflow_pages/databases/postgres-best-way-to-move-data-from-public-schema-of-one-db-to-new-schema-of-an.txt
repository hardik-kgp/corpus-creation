*** postgres-best-way-to-move-data-from-public-schema-of-one-db-to-new-schema-of-an ***

 I am new to Postgres and just discovered that I cannot access data of different databases in one SQL query. And also learned the concept of schema in Postgres. 
 Now, I have two databases 
 db1 and db2 
 Both have tables with same name in their public schema.  
 Now, I want to create a new schema in db1 with name : new_schema 
 And move data from db2.public to db1.new_schema 
 What is the easiest way to do this ? 
 
 The simplest way to do that is to rename schemas. However you must be sure you are a sole user of db1 database. 
 First, hide your schema public in db1: 
 
 Next, do the backup and restore: 
 
 Finally, recreate appropriate schema names: 
 
 Another option is to use  dblink.  It enables accessing data of different databases. 
 
 Export "public" from db2 (skipping grants and ownership): 
 
 The exported file will set up the search path (somewhere near the top): 
 
 change it to: 
 
 Import to db1 as usual: 
 
 You'll probably want to move everything from public to a new schema in db1, first. 
 If the schema is already set up in db1, you can do the transfer in one go: 
 
 Wouldn't recommend that without a lot of testing, of course.
