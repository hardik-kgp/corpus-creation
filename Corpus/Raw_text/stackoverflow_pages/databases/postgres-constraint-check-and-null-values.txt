 In fact, you don't really need to do anything else. A check constraint is satisfied if the check expression evaluates to true or the null value. 
 Your constraint CHECK ( y > x ) would work as is in your scenario because the row foobar would not violate the constraint since it evaluates to null 
 
 You can put an IS NULL test into the CHECK expression, like this:
