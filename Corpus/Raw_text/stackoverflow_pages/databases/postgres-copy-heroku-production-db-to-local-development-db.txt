*** postgres-copy-heroku-production-db-to-local-development-db ***

 I have a heroku database,  . 
 I then have a local database,  . 
 The schema is the same on both of these databases - I want to pull all of the data from my production database and overwrite my local database, so that local is an exact replica of production at the time of pull. 
 How can I do that in Postgres? 
 
 Use heroku's "pg:pull": 
 You'll need to clear your local DB: 
 
 The collect some information from Heroku: 
 
 This will connect to the heroku DB, and copy it to the local database. 
 See  Heroku's documentation on pg:pull  for more details. 
 
 clean your local database: 
 
 dump your heroku database: 
 
 load data in your local database 
 
 
 this is how i do it, be sure to gzip it as your database grows. also don't export the ACL as you likely don't have the same postgres user on heroku and local accounts. replace  with your specific details. 
 
 
 Use your terminal to make a local   and then either   or   it into your local database.

 If this is a Rails app, you can use the following script to overwrite your local database with the latest dump you've generated on Heroku. If you uncomment the line with  , the script will generate a new snapshot on Heroku before downloading it to your machine. 
 Note that you shouldn't have to edit the script, since it reads all the configuration from your database.yml file. 
 
 See the  Heroku docs on downloading DB backups  for details. 
 
 This command should do the work:
