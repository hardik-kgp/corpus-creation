*** postgres-could-not-connect-to-server ***

 After I did brew update and brew upgrade, my postgres got some problem. I tried to uninstall postgres and install again, but it didn't work as well.  
 This is the error message.(I also got this error message when I try to do rake db:migrate) 
 
 How can I solve it? 
 Mac version:      Mountain lion. 
 homebrew version: 0.9.3 
 postgres version: psql (PostgreSQL) 9.2.1 
 And this is what I did. 
 
 Now, after I reinstalled howbrew,when I use  , It doesn't show any error message. 
 But I run   in my rails app, it shows: 
 
 **Finally I find the solution.**

 
 This solution is little tricky, but it works. Hope anyone have a better solution 
 **Update**

 This works for me as well. 
 
 
 Had a similar problem; a pid file was blocking postgres from starting up. To fix it: 
 
 and then all is well. 
 
 This can sometimes be an issue with a postgres upgrade.   
 In my case, it happened when upgrading from 9.3 to 9.4. 
 See  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/upgrading.html 
 OS X/Homebrew: 
 Try running   -- it will give you a much more verbose output if postgres fails to start. 
 In my case, running   removed my old databases and then reinitialized the postgres db schema.   
 Thanks to  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/35240  for that solution. 
 After regenerating my databases (with  ) everything worked fine again. 
 
 Found a solution that worked for me here: 
 https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/75214/psql-could-not-connect-to-server-no-such-file-or-directory 
 You basically run the following command to manually start the server: 
 
 
 On Yosemite, if the pid file is blocking Postgres from starting and you have a   daemon trying (and failing) to load the database daemons, then you'll need to unload the the plist file: 
 
 Then remove the pid file 
 
 Then reload the   daemon 
 
 
 If installing and uninstalling postgres with brew doesn't work for you, look at the logs of your postgresql installation or: 
 
 if you see this kind of output: 
 
 Then try the following: 
 
 Then start the server:

 For anyone reading this and using Postgres.app, you may need   in your database.yml.  http://postgresapp.com/documentation#toc_3 
 
 Upgrading the database works for me 
 
 
 
 worked for me! 
 
 Check that the socket file exists. 
 
 If it doesn't then check your postgresql.conf for unix_socket_directory change. 
 
 
 The problem can also be attributed to a crashed process that left postmaster.pid file behind.
I do this and work's: 
 
 
 The problem is because there is already a running service on the port 5432 and we cannot establish psql socket connection through this port. 
 I removed the socket file 
 
 Then I reinitialized postgres services 
 
 This worked for me. 
 
 Changing postresql or database.yml config settings, changing $PATH, or creating symlinks were all unnecessary for me. All I needed to do was   and then   (or  ). 
 The issue was that the pg gem had been installed before homebrew postgres, so was picking up the settings from the version of postgres that comes with MacOS. Reinstalling it (and thus rebuilding the native extension) fixed the problem. 
 
 This happened to me when I upgraded from 9.3.4 to 9.5 as the databases are incompatible without upgrading. 
 I used pg_upgrade as follows: 
 Stop postgres 
 
 Upgrade the databases: 
 
 Archive the old databases: 
 
 Restart postgres: 
 
 Updated Gems (for rails / active record) : 
 
 
 This is actually what you are supposed to do: 
 you should instead look at /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid 
 and then look at the first line of the file - this is the bad PID 
 Run  
 
 for example: 
 
 then do 
 
 for example 
 
 Assuming it's still running

 **do not listen to the accepted answer it is bad and will corrupt your data!!!**

 
 The most fool proof way around this is to do 
 
 This will keep your user permission etc all intact and everything is reset to new. Works all the time ! 
 
 Psql option  
 -h hostname
--host=hostname 
 : Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running.
 **If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix-domain socket.**

 
 Run psql with -host Option 
 
 No need to make a soft link 
 
 Came across this issue too on MacOS Sierra and when we ran pg_ctl as described above we then had the following error  . So we followed the steps  here  which solved our issue, namely: 
 
 
 
 
 If postgres was installed using homebrew, you can fix this by running: 
 
 
 This worked for me (as a mix of previous answers):

 FWIW this happened to me today, but what happened was that I was running Ubuntu updates at the time, which were likely updating Postgres. Once the update completed, I was able to connect without a hitch. 
 For completeness' sake, I was trying to retrieve records from the database from a Rails console: 
 
 
 It looks like your psql doesn't run. You should run it before connect. You can do that using Postgres.app for Mac OS only. (Download and install this app  http://postgresapp.com ) Open the app, and you have a PostgreSQL server ready and awaiting new connections. Close the app, and the server shuts down. You also can find this info here  http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/ . Hope this will help you. 
 
 It is because a previous server a still running, try closing everything down and re-running your application. 
 
 For those who use this command and doesn't work or the file is not there and are using Ruby on Rails 
 
 rm /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid 
 
 Or any other command and just keep on failing. 
 I solved this problem uninstalling with Brew.
I had to uninstall with brew 2 times, because at the first uninstall there will remain another version of postgresql, with the second uninstall the process will be completed. 
 Install postgresql with Brew 
 Then drop, create and migrate the data bases of the project 
 (Don't forget to start the postgresql server) 
 
 I got same issue because I'm using a wrong Postgres's username in code. I logged into postgres   and enter   to take role name and correct Postgres's username. 
 So when you guys face this issue, you guys need to make sure you're using correct Postgres username, password, hostname and database... 
 Hope this will help anyone  
 
 Â¿Are you recently changed the pg_hba.conf? if you did just check for any typo in: 
 "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only 
 local   all             all                                     password 
 IPv4 local connections: 
 host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            password 
 IPv6 local connections: 
 host    all             all             ::1/128                 password 
 Sometimes a simple mistake can give us a headache. I hope this help and sorry if my english is no good at all. 
 
 This happens when postgres server is not running. 
Steps to properly install Postgres via Homebrew on MAC : 
 
 
  
[This initializes postgres to use the given directory as the database directory. Normally it is not adviced to use the user directory for database storage. Edit sudoers file to add initdb and similar commands and then run initdb on /usr/local/var/postgres] 
 
[After getting success with step 2 it will prompt to run step 3. This command manually starts the server.] 
 
 
 I ran into this issue after trying to restore/drop/create a db while other processes were accessing them. MacOSX/Homebrew fix was: 
 
 close all other accessing processes  ,  ,  , etc... 
 load/unload using the commands found in  
 run restore/drop/create from before 
 
 
 I got this same error. Turns out postgres just wasn't running at all (it is usually always running in the background, but for whatever reason it wasn't today).  
 If this is the case, just type   in the command line of your project directory 
 
 After a tremendous amount of back and forth, it really came down to the   gem version I was using.  On mavericks,   version   would not connect to port 5432 but version   works just fine - very odd. 
 
 For me it was an apache upgrade that caused the problem. I could still run psql in console or call db directly from kdevelop. Also it worked to add "host=localhost" to connection string. 
 BUT the real problem was that apache had changed to private tmp. 
 **Solution:**
 Update /usr/lib/systemd/system/apache2.service and change PrivateTmp=true to PrivateTmp=false. 
 I am working on OpenSuse OS, but I guess that something similar could happen on Mac.
