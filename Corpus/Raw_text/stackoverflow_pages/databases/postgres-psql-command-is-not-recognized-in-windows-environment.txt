*** postgres-psql-command-is-not-recognized-in-windows-environment ***

 It seems like I have it set up, I have my database.yml using postgres, and I can connect the database with pgadmin III, but when I tried using the psql command to test what version, it says that is is not recognized? Any idea what I should be doing? 
 I'm using windows and using command prompt with Ruby on Rails. Using PostgreSQL 9.2 installed with the EnterpriseDB one-click installer. 
 
 Assuming you installed PostgreSQL on Windows with the PostgreSQL "One-click" installer packaged by EnterpriseDB,   is not added to the   automatically. That's partly because adding it to the path could otherwise cause confusion when people have multiple versions of PostgreSQL installed. 
 You need to specify the full explicit path to  , eg: 
 
 or add   to the user   environment variable, see eg  this guide . 
 
 Open Command Line 
 
 if on above line psql version is not displayed, then follow below steps 
 
 Add this 
 
 save it then 
 Reopen Command Prompt and repeat 
 
 
 it is because there should not be space between the   and your psql path so it should be like  . 
 If there is a space after  ; then it will not work. You can actually type  in your cmd prompt and see how your environment variable and space looks like. I tried both cases for you, the first with space had the same error you mentioned and the second without space worked.  
 
 You need to set both the bin AND the lib path in your PATH environment variable separated by semicolons: 
 %PROGRAMFILES%\Postgresql\9.2\bin;%PROGRAMFILES%\Postgresql\9.2\lib
