*** postgresql-character-varying-length-limit ***

 I am using character varying data type in PostgreSQL. 
I was not able to find this information in PostgreSQL manual.
What is max limit of characters in character varying data type? 
 
 Referring to the  documentation , there is no explicit limit given for the   type definition. But: 
 
 ... 
  In any case, the longest possible
  character string that can be stored is
  about 1 GB. (The maximum value that
  will be allowed for   in the data type
  declaration is less than that. It
  wouldn't be very useful to change this
  because with multibyte character
  encodings the number of characters and
  bytes can be quite different anyway.
  If you desire to store long strings
  with no specific upper limit, use text
  or character varying without a length
  specifier, rather than making up an
  arbitrary length limit.) 
 
 Also note this: 
 
 **Tip:**
 There is no performance
  difference among these three types,
  apart from increased storage space
  when using the blank-padded type, and
  a few extra CPU cycles to check the
  length when storing into a
  length-constrained column. While
  character(n) has performance
  advantages in some other database
  systems, there is no such advantage in
  PostgreSQL; in fact character(n) is
  usually the slowest of the three
  because of its additional storage
  costs. In most situations text or
  character varying should be used
  instead. 
 
 
 From  documentation : 
 
 In any case, the longest possible character string that can be stored is about 1 GB. 
 
 
 character type in postgresql  
 
 character varying(n), varchar(n)  = variable-length with limit 
 character(n), char(n)             = fixed-length, blank padded 
 text                              = variable unlimited length 
 
 based on your problem I suggest you to use type  **text**
. the type does not require character length. 
 
 In addition, PostgreSQL provides the  **text**
 type, which stores strings of any length. Although the type text is not in the SQL standard, several other SQL database management systems have it as well.

 The maximum string size is about  **1 GB**
.  Per the postgres  docs : 
 
 Very long values are also stored in background tables so that they do not interfere with rapid access to shorter column values. In any case, the longest possible character string that can be stored is about 1 GB.  (The maximum value that will be allowed for  **n**
 in the data type declaration is less than that.) 
 
 Note that the max  **n**
 you can specify for varchar is less than the max storage size.  While this limit may vary, a quick check reveals that the limit on postgres 11.2 is  **10 MB**
: 
 
 Practically speaking, when you do not have a well rationalized length limit, it's  suggested  that you simply use   without specifying one.  Per the official docs, 
 
 If you desire to store long strings with no specific upper limit, use text or character varying without a length specifier, rather than making up an arbitrary length limit.
