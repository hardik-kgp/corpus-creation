 When I try to change the data type of a column in a table by alter command...

 How can I change the datatype from bigint to bigserial? 
 
 As explained in the  documentation ,   is not a datatype, but a shortcut for a collection of other commands. 
 So while you can't change it simply by altering the type, you can achieve the same effect by running these other commands yourself: 
 
 Altering the owner will ensure that the sequence is removed if the table/column is dropped. It will also give you the expected behaviour in the  pg_get_serial_sequence()  function. 
 Sticking to the   naming convention is necessary to convince some tools like pgAdmin to report this column type as  . Note that psql and pg_dump will always show the underlying definition, even if the column was initially declared as a   type. 
 As of Postgres 10, you also have the option of using an SQL standard  identity column , which handles all of this invisibly, and which you can easily add to an existing table:

 Instead you can create a sequence yourself, then assign it as the default for a column: 
 
 
 This is a simple workaround:
