*** postgresql-convert-column-from-integer-to-text ***

 I have a PostgreSQL (9.0) database with a column card_id which is currently of type integer 
 I need to change this to type text 
 What is the most best way to achieve this? 
 The only solution I can find involves creating a temporary column, dropping the original then renaming, I thought they might be a better method?? 
 
 Have you tried what the fine manual  suggests : 
 
 Depending on the current and the new type you may need to add   to this statement.
But in your specific case that should not be necessary I believe.
