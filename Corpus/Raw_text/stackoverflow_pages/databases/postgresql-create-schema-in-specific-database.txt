*** postgresql-create-schema-in-specific-database ***

 I need to write an  **sql script**
 that creates both a  **new database **
**AND**
** a new schema**
 in the database I just created. 
 How can I do it? Can I somehow change the current database to the new one? Or can I somehow specify the database for CREATE SCHEMA? 
 I'm using PostgreSQL 9.0 
 
 You can connect to the database, and execute the "CREATE SCHEMA" statement. That should result in a new schema in that database. It's not as tough as you think ;)  When you want to do this from a .SQL file instead, you can use the \connect command as such:
