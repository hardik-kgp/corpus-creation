*** postgresql-data-type-for-md5-message-digest ***

 I want to use the MD5 message digest of some string as the primary key of a table. What  datatype  should I use for such a field? What   and   statements should I write for the field? 
 
 The md5 hash as   will use only 16 bytes in instead of 32 for the hexa representation: 
 
 Both forms above will work but to use the simpler   function it is necessary to install the   extension as superuser: 
 
 Use the   function or the combination of   and   as above to search for a certain string: 
 
 The   value is the storage size. It is less than half for the   compared to the hexa representation. 
 
  has a one byte overhead, but with padding to eight bytes this will result in significant wastage. 
 Instead, consider using the   type, which uses just 16 bytes. You'll have to use something like   when selecting it, but that should be a quick operation.
