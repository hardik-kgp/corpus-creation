*** postgresql-database-service ***

 I downloaded PostgreSQL from their site -  http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows 
 However, I can't create a database from  **pgAdmin**
 and get a message: 
 
 could not connect to server:
  Connection refused (0x0000274D/10061)
  Is the server running on host
  "localhost" and accepting TCP/IP
  connections on port 5432? could not
  connect to server: Connection refused
  (0x0000274D/10061) Is the server
  running on host "localhost" and
  accepting TCP/IP connections on port
  5432? 
 
 Do I have to create a windows service? How is it called? Do I have to install it separately? 
 **EDITED**

 Let me explain myself. I am trying to run the service. I tried running postgres.exe from the command line but still it does not run. 
 What could run the database? 
 **EDITED**

 The problem was with my installation file. I downloaded it again - and it worked well! 
 
 Use services (start -> run -> services.msc) and look for the postgresql-[version] service. 
 
 If it is not there you might have just installed pgAdmin and not installed PostgreSQL itself. 
 If it is not running try to start it, if it won't start open the event-viewer (start -> run -> eventvwr) and look for error messages relating to the PostgreSQL service. 
 If it does start check the startup type, if you want it to start with windows it should be "Automatic"; or perhaps "Automatic, delayed start" if you don't want it to slow down startup too much. 
 
 
 Adding to the first, because in a different comment you've said the service isn't there. It is possible to download a standalone pgAdmin so you can connect to an external PostgreSQL database. It would seem you have done such a thing, or explicitly chosen to not add the service. Just try the  One Click Installer , which still allows proper configuration of installation directory despite its name. 
 
 You might get a more descriptive error message if you tried to start the service from command line using this command: 
 
 The log file would be at  .
Note that paths and service name might be different depending on your installation.  
 
 I have the solution to this problem enters (Start -> Run -> services.msc) are looking for the postgresql service once you localizas le das Properties---> login and you disable the account you have and what you leave as the local system account , save and restart the programs pgadmin3 and ready should operate.

 (start -> run -> services.msc) and look for the postgresql-[version] service then right click and enable it 
 
 You only need to do  
 
 then execute servcies.msc 
 enable the "PostgresSQL" and set to auto 
 then, your postgresql will run like the "server". 
 
 
 check conenctionstring 
 check SSL 
 check firewall 
 if u use VS studio, check for db driver 
 
 
 I'm not on windows, but I think you can use the pgAdmin you just installed to configure a server connection and start the server. 
 
 Your server might not be running. This can have 2 issus IMO: 
 
 I had the problem that the permissions were not set on the postgres folders and so the service was not able to start. I have no idea why that happend but giving proper permissions on the root postges folder and subfolders did the trick. If I recall it correctly, postgres is also installed as a service so you should find it in the Service List 
 To start the server, you have a startcommand in your Startmenu. Somewhere at Start -> PostgreSQL -> Start Service/Server/... (haven't used it on Windows for a long time but it should be there).  
 
 
 If you don't want or can't install postgres again, you can install the server from the binary zip like  this post  explains it.

 install above downloaded file  
 then 
 The solution was simply to delete %appdata%\pgAdmin (win key + r then type %appdata% got folder pgAdmin) which was created by an earlier version. On systems other than Windows, there probably is a pgAdmin directory in your user directory. Of course, all session settings etc. are gone after deleting this. 
 
 The solution was simply to comment the lines "work_mem=256MB" and "maintenance_work_mem=$3GB"  in the file postgresql.conf and try to start the postgresql service. (start -> run -> services.msc) and look for the postgresql-[version] service then right click and start.
