*** postgresql-docker-role-does-not-exist ***

 I downloaded the docker container for postgres:  https://hub.docker.com/r/library/postgres/ , and did the following: 
 
 My plan is to use this database on docker with Django, so first want to check I can connect, but I cant. 
 
 I do the same with PSequal.app, says the same thing,
Im running on Mac High Sierra.  
 Why am I getting this error? The role exists, or at least it seems it to me... 
 
 The problem was simple enough that my computer was already running an instance of Postgres that I was not aware was still running (not inside Docker) on  , checked with: 
 
 So I remembered I installed it via  https://gist.github.com/sgnl/609557ebacd3378f3b72 , I ran 
 
 And then I had no problem connecting to the Docker instance.

 This question recently passed 10,000 views, so I thought I should elaborate more on why this happened. 
 Usually running through docker, using python and connecting to a postgres database requires you to install  , via  , but if you run this command you will get: 
 
 This is because psycopg2 requires an operating system install of the postgres libraries: 
 
 Now, on a Mac, you will need to do the same with brew: 
 
 One thing that I didn't realise, is that on Mac, doing the above will not only install required libraries, but  **also**
 start a database on  . Because this was all done in the background, it didn't occur to me that this was the problem as none of the usual errors popped up to inform that the port was being used, etc... 
 
 In my case, the problem may be due also to the use of a super user who is not postgres. Lhe developers chose the user georchestra in the geOrchestra docker composition.
Extract from the dockerfile: 
 
 consequently, you will have to use the option "-U georchestra" to connect to the container. 
 
 and of course, trying to connect with the user postgres causes an error:
