*** postgresql-driver-for-go-programming-language ***

 http://go-lang.cat-v.org/pure-go-libs  lists two PosgreSQL drivers, but they haven't been updated since months and looking like one man shows. So I wonder if they are reliable / ready for production or if there are other recommended drivers. 
 Would you use Go with PostgreSQL for production and with what driver? 
 
 In the year and a half since this question was asked,  **pq**
 has matured significantly and is actively maintained (multiple commits by multiple people in the last week, consistent weekly updates for the last several months). 
 Docs are here:  http://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq 
 
 A list of SQL DB drivers can be found  here 
 
 On this basis I probably wouldn't  **go**
 for it in production... 
 The newest one seems to be  https://github.com/jbarham/gopgsqldriver 
 But one of the advantages of open source is that you have all the source so you can maintain it yourself, contribute patches or even take over the maintainer's role.
