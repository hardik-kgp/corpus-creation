*** postgresql-drop-table-doesnt-work ***

 I'm trying to drop a few tables with the   command but for a unknown reason, the program just "sits" and doesn't delete the table that I want it to in the database. 
 I have 3 tables in the database: 
 Product, Bill and Bill_Products which is used for referencing products in bills. 
 I managed to delete/drop Product, but I can't do the same for bill and Bill_Products.
I'm issuing the same   command but the command line just stalls. I've also used the simple version without the   option. 
 Do you have any idea why this is happening? 
 Update: 
 I've been thinking that it is possible for the databases to keep some references from products to bills and maybe that's why it won't delete the Bill table. 
 So, for that matter i issued a simple   and after a few (10-15) seconds (strangely, because I don't think it's normal for it to last such a long time when there's an empty table) it printed out the table and it's contents, which are none. (so  apparently  there are no references left from Products to Bill). 
 
 What is the output of 
 
 It might be that there're other sessions using your table in parallel and you cannot obtain  Access Exclusive  lock to drop it. 
 
 Just do 
 
 And then kill every pid by 
 
 Where 1234 is your actual pid from query results. 
 You can pipe it all together like this (so you don't have to copy-paste every pid manually): 
 
 
 So I was hitting my head against the wall for some hours trying to solve the same issue, and here is the solution that worked for me: 
 Check if PostgreSQL has a pending prepared transaction that's never been committed or rolled back: 
 
 If you get a result, then for each transaction  **gid**
 you must execute a  **ROLLBACK**
 from the database having the problem:

 Had the same problem. 
 There were not any locks on the table. 
 Reboot helped. 
 
 Old question but ran into a similar issue. Could not reboot the database so tested a few things until this sequence worked : 
 
 truncate table foo; 
 drop index concurrently foo_something; times 4-5x 
 alter table foo drop column whatever_foreign_key; times 3x 
 alter table foo drop column id; 
 drop table foo;
