 If you don't have mlocate installed, either install it or use  
 
 
 There's a good answer to  a similar question on SuperUser . 
 In short: 
 
 Postgres groups databases into "clusters", each of which is a named collection of databases sharing a configuration and data location, and running on a single server instance with its own TCP port. 
 If you only want a single instance of Postgres, the installation includes a cluster named "main", so you don't need to run   to create one. 
 If you do need multiple clusters, then the Postgres packages for Debian and Ubuntu provide a different command   to be used instead of  , with the latter not included in   so as to discourage end users from using it directly. 
 
 And if you're just trying to create a database, not a database cluster, use the   command instead. 
 
 I had the same problem and found the answer  here . 
 Ubuntu path is  
 
 /usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/initdb 
 
 Edit: Sorry, Ahmed asked about linuxbrew, I'm talking about Ubuntu.
