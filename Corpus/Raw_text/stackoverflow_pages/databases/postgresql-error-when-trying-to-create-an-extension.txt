*** postgresql-error-when-trying-to-create-an-extension ***

 
 Is what I get when I try to   can anybody tell me why is it so and what can I do to fix it? 
 
 The following will get you a working postgis install on Ubuntu 12.04 (Note: also tested on 13.10) 
 
 Based on the docs at  https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt 
 
 You need to install  . In Ubuntu or Debian, you need to run the following command as root: 
 
 This adds the files needed to create the   extensions. 
 
 Installing this package did the trick for me on my Linux Mint 16 box: 
 
 
 Daniel Vérité is close to the truth, but not enough. The package missing is  : 
 
 
 Presumably the   version you installed is 1.5.x which doesn't come as an extension, but as a couple of SQL scripts that need to be manually applied to create the necessary SQL objects. 
 Also the   package is not enough, it contains only stuff that doesn't depend on PG version, you need   (  is handy to check out the files provided by any particular package). 
 Once the installation paths are known, the official  install documentation  should be good enough to set up the template database. 
 
 Just resolved it.
You have to uninstall postgis-1.5. You installed it instaed of PostGIS 2.0. As soon as you will install   you will see corrected libraries in extension directory.
Before installing you should to add a correct repository (see  http://docs.pgrouting.org/2.0/en/doc/src/installation/index.html#ubuntu-debian ). Use   for PostGIS 2.0.
Try one of 
 
 I couldn't remove and install because of dependencies error.
After a few attmpts, I just removed   and apt-get offer me upgrade it to 2.0. 
 
 I had the same problem on my Window 8.1 setup. 
 I solved it by simply using   which comes with Postgres and installing PostGIS again (despite not having uninstalled it) 
 Works fine now! 
 
 In C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4 I found uninstall-postgis-bundle-pg94x64-2.1.5-2.exe. Running that fixed my problem, which was caused by a reinstall of PostgreSQL without first uninstalling, and without installing PostGIS the second time around. That's what happens when you more than one person installing stuff.. 
 
 Make sure that you have installed this 
 
 I was facing same issue due to missing this package. 
 
 On 14.04, there is  , which  contains  the   file. 
 
 Try this 
 
 
 CentOS needs a different package for this problem. For CentOS 6, if you're using the PGDG yum repository at  http://yum.pgdgrpms.org/9.3/redhat/ , install the postgresql93-contrib package with the command 'yum install postgresql93-contrib. 
 Update and edit as necessary for PostgreSQL 9.4. 
 
 I had my worst nightmare while installing Postgis 2.X on SLES 12 SP1. which doesnt have compatible package in zypper repo 
 Here is how is resolved it on my Postgres server instance running 9.4.X 
 **Prerequsite packages which i have installed prior to PostGis based on the errors**

 
 **Installing Postgis**

 
 now if you goto postgress DB and create extension postgis; it will work 
 **Important**
 while configuring you should specify pg-config path and geosconfig path and You SHOULD NOT include "without Raster" as RASTER plays main role in creating the postgis extension 
 
 this work for me 
 
 To create postgisis run above query in query panel  
 And for remove postgis from your database run bellow query  
 
 
 if you are using windows system download the   and manually install in   and that's all .
