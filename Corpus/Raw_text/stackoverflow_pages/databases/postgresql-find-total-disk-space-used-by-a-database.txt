*** postgresql-find-total-disk-space-used-by-a-database ***

 I have more than 50 databases hosted in my postgresql server. I need to move some of them on another host, to free-up some disk space,but how can I measure the disk-space used by each database on my volume? 
 Is there any function exists to get the information that I want? 
 
 
 or

 You could use postgresql Meta-Commands: 
 
  would list databases 
  extends list with Size, Tablespace, Description. 
 
 Use   to get full list of meta-commands. Also see:

 This is an old question, but I created a way to see the results of linux command   (Filesystem, Size, Used, Avail, Use%, Mounted on) via a sql query, thus your free disk space and total available disk space for a given file system. Not exactly what the question is about, but helpful for some of use/me. I wish that answer was here hours ago, so I am putting it here (linux only): 
 create a cron job like this: 
 
 create a foreign table to query: 
 
 Then query your table like this: 
 
 If you just want something specific, of course just filter the table for what you want. It has limitations, but is very useful for me. 
 If you have  , you could use this function:

 Love mountainclimber's answer.  I tweaked the cron to return bytes and remove the header row as follows.
