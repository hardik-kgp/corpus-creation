*** postgresql-get-a-random-datetime-timestamp-between-two-datetime-timestamp ***

 The title is pretty much explicit, my question is if i get two dates with hour: 
 
 01-10-2014 10:00:00 
 01-20-2014 20:00:00 
 
 Is it possible to pick a random datetime between these two datetime ? 
 I tried with the random() function but i don't really get how to use it with datetime 
 Thanks

 You can do almost everything with the  date/time operators : 
 
 
 I adapted @pozs answer, since I didn't have timestamps to go off of. 
  is the time window you want and the   is how far out to push the time window. This is helpful when running it via a job instead of at a set time. 
 
 
 You could build the timestamp from a random integer (unix stamp), e.g.: 
 
 Wrap it in an SQL function if you use it often, as it's not very readable even after attempting to format it somewhat. 
 Another way to do it would be to use   from the start date to the end date, ordered by random(), but that would make things very slow with larger date intervals so you'll be better off with the above approach.
