*** postgresql-how-to-create-table-only-if-it-does-not-already-exist ***

 In Postgresql, how can I do a condition to create a table only if it does not already exist?  
 Code example appreciated.  
 
 I'm not sure when it was added, but for the sake of completeness I'd like to point out that in version 9.1 (maybe before)   can be used.   will only create the table if it doesn't exist already. 
 Example: 
 
 This will create a table named   in the schema   if the table doesn't exist.

 Just create the table and don't worry about whether it exists. If it doesn't exist it will be created; if it does exist the table won't be modified. You can always check the return value of your SQL query to see whether the table existed or not when you executed the create statement. 
 
 I think to check the pg_class table perhaps help you, something like that:

 This is an old question.  I'm only bringing back to suggest another answer.  Note:  **other better answers already exist, this is just for educational purposes**

 The easiest way is to do what others have said; perform the CREATE TABLE if you want to keep the existing data, or perform a DROP IF EXISTS and then a CREATE TABLE, if you want a freshly created table. 
 Another alternative is to query the system table for its existence and proceed from there. 
 
 In use: 
 
 If it matches you'll have a true value, otherwise it should return an empty dataset.  You can use that value to determine if you need to perform a CREATE TABLE. 
 
 The best answer has been given by Skalli if you're running Postgresql 9.1+. 
 If like me you need to do that with Postgresql 8.4, you can use a function with a 'duplicate_table' exception catch. 
 This will ignore the generated error when the table exists and keep generating other errors. 
 Here is an example working on Postgresql 8.4.10 : 
 
 
 What I used to check whether or not a table exists (Java & PostgreSQL)
prior to creating it.  I hope this helps someone.
The create table portion is not implemented here, just the check to see if
a table already exists.
Pass in a connection to the database and the tableName and it should return whether
or not the table exists. 
 
 
 The easiest answer is : 
 
 This creates a table if not exists and produces an error if exists. And the error is caught.

 Try running a query on the table. If it throws an exception then catch the exception and create a new table.
