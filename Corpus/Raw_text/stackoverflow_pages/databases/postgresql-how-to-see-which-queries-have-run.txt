*** postgresql-how-to-see-which-queries-have-run ***

 I have a PostgreSQL DB at my computer and I have an application that runs queries on it. 
 How can I see which queries has run on my DB? 
 I use a Linux computer and pgadmin. 
 
 Turn on the server log: 
 
 This will log every call to the database server. 
 I would not use   on a production server. Produces huge log files. 
 The manual about logging-parameters: 
 
  ( ) 
 Controls which SQL statements are logged. Valid values are   (off),  ,  , and   (all statements). [...] 
 
 Resetting the   parameter requires a server reload ( ). A restart is  not  necessary. Read  the manual on how to set parameters . 
 Don't confuse the server log with pgAdmin's log. Two different things! 
 You can also look at the server log files in pgAdmin, if you have access to the files (may not be the case with a remote server) and set it up correctly. Have a look at:  . Read more about the server status window in the  manual for pgAdmin III . 
 I prefer to read the server log files with   (or an editor / reader of your choice). 
 
 PostgreSql is very advanced when related to logging techniques 
 Logs are stored in  . While log settings are placed in   file. 
 Log format is usually set as  . But CSV log format is recommended. In order to enable CSV format change in  
 
 In order to log all queries, very usefull for new installations, set min. execution time for a query 
 
 In order to view active Queries on your database, use 
 
 To log specific queries set query type  
 
 For more information on Logging queries see  PostgreSql Log . 
 
 I found the log file at /usr/local/var/log/postgres.log on a mac installation from brew. 
 
 While using  **Django**
 with postgres 10.6, logging was enabled by default, and I was able to simply do: 
 
 Ubuntu 18.04, django 2+, python3+ 
 
 You can see in pg_log folder if the log configuration is enabled in postgresql.conf with this log directory name.
