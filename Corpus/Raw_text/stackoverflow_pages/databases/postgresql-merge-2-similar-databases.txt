*** postgresql-merge-2-similar-databases ***

 I have a requirement of merging two databases (Database1 & Database2) to a common database in Postgresql. 
 Database1 
 Table1 
 **Id  -   Value**
 (Id is Primary key) 
 1  -    a 
2   -   aa 
3  -   aaa 
4   -   aaaa       
 Database2 
 Table1 
 **Id     Value**
 (Id is Primary key) 
 2  -    bb 
5  -    bbbbb        
 I want my output as  
 OutPutDatabase 
 Table1 
 **Id     Value**
 (Id is Primary key) 
 1  -    a 
2  -    bb 
3  -    aaa 
4  -    aaaa 
5   -   bbbbb  
 How can I achieve this?  
 
 Not my idea, but one I have read in the past. 
 The source: Move table to new database 
 
 
 First, load the tables into two separate schemas in the same database. 
 
 Then you can merge the two, by prioritizing db2 over db1. 
 
 
 I used the   function defined  here  to migrate the primary keys of multiple tables (with the same schema but different values from different databases) to distinct ranges so that I could merge the tables. 
 This is the approximate sequence I followed to merge two databases,   and  , each of which has a table  : 
 
 Dump   and   to the respective files   and  . This is the command I used to dump: 
 
 Create a new, empty database on a local PostgreSQL server. 
 Load  . 
 Migrate   using: 
 
 Record the value printed (4 in this example). That will be the start of the next sequence. 
 Dump to the file   in the same way as above. 
 Repeat steps 2 through 4 with   but use the value from step 5 as the argument to  : 
 
 Dump to the file   without saving the schema and disable triggers. This is the command I used: 
 
 Create a new, empty database. 
 Load   and   in order. If everything worked as expected, the primary keys should be disjoint and not conflict. 
 Dump the database if you want to load it into a remote server. 
 
 
 I have been able to easily merge 2 postgres database using pg_dump & pg_restore. 
 In my case, it was easy as I use UUID identifiers, so there are no duplicated keys. 
 Export (data-only, excluding some schemas and tables): 
 
 Import (changing role if necessary):
