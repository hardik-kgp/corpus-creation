*** postgresql-nested-inserts-withs-for-foreign-key-insertions ***

 I'm using PostgreSQL 9.3, and I'm trying to write a SQL script to insert some data for unit tests, and I've run into a bit of a problem. 
 Let's say we have three tables, structured like this: 
 
 The columns   and   are foreign keys to the   column of tables   and  , respectively. 
 What I'm trying to do is to insert a row into each of these three tables with pure SQL, without having the ID's hard-coded into the SQL (making assumptions about the database before this script is run seems undesirable, since if those assumptions change I'll have to go back and re-compute the proper ID's for all of the test data). 
 Note that I do realize I could do this programatically, but in general writing pure SQL is way less verbose than writing program code to execute SQL, so it makes more sense for test suite data. 
 Anyway, here's the query I wrote which I figured would work: 
 
 However, this doesn't work, and results in PostgreSQL telling me: 
 
 Is there a correct way to write this type of query in general, without hard-coding the ID values? 
 (You can find a fiddle  here  which contains this example.) 
 
 Don't nest the common table expressions, just write one after the other:
