*** postgresql-uuid-generation ***

 
 "one" uuid and "two" uuid are equal! 
 
 postgresql 9.0 pgAdmin 1.12.3 
 
 or 
 
 result: 
 
 whereas 
 postgreSQL maestro 9.2.0.4 
 
 result: 1 rows affected; 
 I understand that maestro added records one by one, but why uuid_generate_v4() returns the same value after two calls? (In pgAdmin case). 
 And how can I add several rows by one request? 
 
 Within a given transaction, the function   returns the same value. 
 When statements are grouped together and run as "one command", there is one transaction, so every call to   will return the same value. 
 The two ways to "fix" this are: 
 
 Make separate database calls every time you use the function (this is easiest) 
 Use a non-auto commit connection where you control the transactions and separate each usage within a   pair (this is a hassle - don't do this unless you have to) 
 
 
 At some point in the past, the   functions were erroneously marked as  , which would result in the behavior you show.  This has been fixed in all the latest minor versions, but you have to re-run the installation script ( ) to get the updated function definitions.  (You can also look into the installation script to verify that you have an up-to-date version.  The functions should be marked  .) 
 
 To avoid duplicates you can use generation like this: 
 
 But, be careful: this generates UUID but it is not UUIDv4. See more:  Generating a UUID in Postgres for Insert statement? 
 
 
 it's possible too
