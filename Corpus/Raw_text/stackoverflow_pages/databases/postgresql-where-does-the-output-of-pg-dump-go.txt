*** postgresql-where-does-the-output-of-pg-dump-go ***

 I am trying to backup a db of postgresql and I want to use   command. 
I tried : 
 
 But I don't know where the output file goes. 
Any help will be appreciated 
 
 Go to command prompt and directory postgresql\9.3\bin.  
 **Example**

 . 
 
 After above command enter User "postgres" password and check   drive for   file 
 
 In my situation (PostgreSQL 9.1.21, Centos 6.7), the command 
 
 saved the file here: 
 
 Not sure if that is true for other Linux dists, CentOS and/or pgl versions. According to  the answer post by the asker of this question , this is true, but other users said the backup file was in the current directory (a situation different of most people reading this thread, for obvious reasons). Well, I hope this can help other users with the same problem. 
 P.s.: if that's not the path for your situation, you can try (in Linux) to find it using the below command (as stated by @Bohemian in the comments of this question), but this can take a while: 
 
 **EDIT:**
 I tried to run the analogous command in Ubuntu 12.04 (it works on Ubuntu 18.04): 
 
 And in this case the file was saved in the current directory where I ran the command! So both cases can happen in Linux, depending of the specific dist you are working 
 
 I'm late to this party, but I feel that none of the answers are really correct. Most seem to imply that   writes a file somewhere. It doesn't.  You  are sending the output to a file, and  you  told the shell where to write that file. 
 In your example  , which uses the   or SQL format, the   command  **does not store**
 any file anywhere. It just sends the output to  , which is usually your screen, and it's done. 
 But in your command, you also told your shell (Terminal, Command prompt, whatever) to redirect STDOUT to a file. This has nothing to do with   but is a standard feature of shells like Bash or cmd.exe. 
 You used   to redirect STDOUT to a file instead of the screen. And you gave the file name: "backup.sql". Since you didn't specify any path, the file will be in your current directory. This is probably your home directory, unless you have done a   into some other directory. 
 In the particular case of  , you could also have used an alternative to the   shell redirection, by using the   option : 
 
 -f file  --file=file 
 Send output to the specified file. This parameter can be omitted for file based output formats, 
  in which case the standard output is used. 
 
 So your command could have been  , asking pg_dump to write directly to that file. 
 But in any case, you give the file name, and if you don't specify a path, the file is created in your current directory. If your prompt doesn't already display your current directory, you can have it shown with the   command on Unix, and   in Windows. 
 
 If you are not specifying fully qualified paths, like:  
 
 then in  Windows  it stores dumps in current user's home directory. I.e.:  
 
 
 In Linux default path is: 
 
 /var/lib/postgresql/ 
 
 
 In pgadmin 4 for a Mac, assuming dump is successful you can click on "More Details" you will see a box that says "Running command:" in that box you will see /Applications/pgAdmin 4.app/Contents/SharedSupport/pg_dump --file "path/to/file" where path to file is the destination of storage.
