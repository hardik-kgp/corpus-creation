*** problem-with-database-collation-change-sql-server-2008 ***

 When I tried to change the collation of my existing database (including data) from   to   the following error occurs: 
 
 Alter failed for Database 'XXXX'.  (Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo) 
 An exception occurred while executing a Transact-SQL statement or batch. 
  (Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo) 
 The object 'ItemTables' is dependent on database collation. The database collation cannot be changed if a schema-bound object depends on it. Remove the dependencies on the database collation and then retry the operation. 
  The object 'CK_FilteredReportColumnFilters' is dependent on database collation. The database collation cannot be changed if a schema-bound object depends on it. Remove the dependencies on the database collation and then retry the operation. 
  The object 'CK_FilteredReportColumnFilters_1' is dependent on database collation. The database collation cannot be changed if a schema-bound object depends on it. Remove the dependencies on the database collation and then retry the operation. 
  The object 'CK_FilteredReportColumnFilters_2' is dependent on database collation. The database collation cannot be changed if a schema-bound object depends on it. Remove the dependencies on the database collation and then retry the operation. 
  The object 'CK_Reports' is dependent on database collation. The database collation cannot be changed if a schema-bound object depends on it. Remove the dependencies on the database collation and then retry the operation.   
 ALTER DATABASE failed. The default collation of database 'XXXX' cannot be set to Persian_100_CS_AS. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 5075) 
 
 Trying to correct the errors mentioned by removing those database objects causes another error with other titles in conversion process. 
 Any idea ?  Is there any well-defined solution to solve this problem? 
 
 Ahh, this is one of the worst problems in SQL Server: you cannot change the collation once an object is created (this is true both for tables and databases...). 
 You can only save your data (don't use bcp or backup utilities, you need to place them in a csv of similar file types...), drop the database, recreate with the right collation and re-import the data into the new database... 
 Hope this helps. 
 
 I have got the same issue and all objects were functions
First takes full backup  
 script function as create.
Delete these function then Run 
 
 Recreate functions 
 I hope this helpful. 
 
 Just create new database with ex database_b.change the collation according to your requirement and
export from  new source to target. 
 or 
 use alt collation tool which will override all the errors. 
 --Appu 
 
 Just type N before writing your string. 
 for example: 
 
 N = unicode.
