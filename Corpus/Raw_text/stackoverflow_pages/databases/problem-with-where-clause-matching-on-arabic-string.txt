*** problem-with-where-clause-matching-on-arabic-string ***

 I have a SQL Server 2005 database in which I have some tables contain Arabic text. The datatype for those fields is  . 
 The Arabic text inside the table is appearing properly, and when selecting, they appear properly.  
 Th problem is that searching for Arabic text results in 0 rows. 
 
 This retrieves no rows, where there is a name with this value.  
 Can you please guide me on how to write the query? 
 
 Try adding N before the text e.g. 
 
 
 select * from table_name
where name like N'%arabic_text%' will work here 
 
 If you search for word احمد and your records have أحمد your query will return nothing even if you are using  **like '%احمد%'**
 .
It is better to use Full-Text search. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Query with Full-Text (Inflectional) 
 
 Here is other example using CONTAINSTABLE  CONTAINSTABLE link
