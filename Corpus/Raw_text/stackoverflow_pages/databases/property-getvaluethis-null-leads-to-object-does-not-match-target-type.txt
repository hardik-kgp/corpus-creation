*** property-getvaluethis-null-leads-to-object-does-not-match-target-type ***

 I have a database class like this 
 
 A DataGridView uses BindingList as it's datasource and I retrieve the selected row of a gridview as a database class instance like this: 
 
 Now I'm trying to loop through the properties of "currentObject" like this: 
 
 But on line   it crashes and I get: 
 
 An unhandled exception of type 'System.Reflection.TargetException'
  occurred in mscorlib.dll 
 Additional information: Object does not match target type. 
 
 What am I missing here?

 to  
 
 First parameter of   requires target instance to get the value. so when you say   runtime throws exception saying that no such property exist in  . 
 
 Try this
