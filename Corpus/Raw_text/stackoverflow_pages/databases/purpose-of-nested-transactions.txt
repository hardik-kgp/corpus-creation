*** purpose-of-nested-transactions ***

 I have never understood what a nested transaction is good for. Committing a nested transaction commits nothing - it just decreases  . And   rollbacks everything. 
 
 What is the difference with this: 
 
 Please give me an example why should nested transactions be used and how they make a difference.

 Nested transactions allows your code to call other code (SPs for instance) which uses transactions itself without actually committing  your  transaction when  they  commit. 
 That said, you can use safepoints to roll back inside of a transaction. 
 There's a  CodeProject article  dedicated to that. 
 
 IF you are having scenario in which you call one SP which contains an other SP call in it. and that inner SP is also could be called independently from your application. In that case its necessary to place inner transaction(on Inner SP) as well as on parent SP.
