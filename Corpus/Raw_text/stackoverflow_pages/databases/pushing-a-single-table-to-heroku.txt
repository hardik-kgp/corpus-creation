*** pushing-a-single-table-to-heroku ***

 I am aware of the   command which pushes an entire database up to Heroku. 
 Now that I am launching my product, I would like to be able to push up only a specific table that contains information collected locally without overwriting existing tables (such as users). 
 Is there a command that enables me to only push specific tables to heroku? 
 
 My suggestion is to use PostgreSQL dump/restore capabilities directly using the   and   commands. 
 With   you can dump a specific table from your local database 
 
 Then grab the Heroku PostgreSQL connection string from the configs 
 
 and restore the table in the remote database, using the information retrieved from Heroku. 
 
 You will need to customize the  ,   and   parameters, as well as the database name. The password will be prompted by  . 
 You can also use the   to filter a dump and restore the table, but I personally prefer  . 
 Note that Heroku is recommending the use of PostgreSQL tools in several documentations, such as  Importing and Exporting  for large data, or whenever the provided CLI commands don't cover specific cases like the one in this question. 
 
 I wrote script which extracts DB url from heroku. Then it dumps single tables from production and restores them on development/localhost. Run it like this: 
 
 Code: 
 
 
 If I understand correctly, you just need a single database table with its locally created data pushed to your Rails production app. Maybe this is a simplistic approach, but you could create a migration for your table and then populate using  . 
 After you've populated the seeds.rb file and pushed your repo to heroku:  
 
 Also, if your local table has a ton of data and you're using Rails 4, check out the seed dump gem:  https://github.com/rroblak/seed_dump . This will take your existing db data and map it to the seed format.
