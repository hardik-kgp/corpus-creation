*** pymongo-mongodbsrv-dnspython-must-be-installed-error ***

 I am trying to connect MongoDB from Atlas But I encountered: 
 
 dnspython must be installed error 
 
 My  **mongo uri**
 (mockup):  
 My  **pymongo version**
:  3.6.1 
I have installed   and done  
 Still, I am getting the error:  
 
 dnspython module must be installed to use mongodb+srv:// URI 
 
 
 In order to use  **mongo+srv**
 protocol, you need to install  **pymongo-srv**

Launch this command to do it with python 3: 
 
 or this one for other versions: 
 
 
 I solved this problem with: 
 $ python -m pip install pymongo[srv] 
 
 In requirements.txt, replace   with  , as mentioned  here . 
 
 May be the protocol, your URI should start with: 
 **mongo+srv**
 instead of mongo+src 
 If it still not working please put a pip list with the versions of PyMongo and dnspython (and version of python that you are using) 
 
 I would like to answer my own questions here. As I mentioned in the comment, the kernel of the jupyter notebook has to be restarted in order for the pymongo to take effect of the loaded  . 
 
 you can use   instead of
