*** python-3-connecting-with-jdbc ***

 How do you connect to a database using a JDBC driver from within Python 3?   JayDeBeApi  seems to do the job for Python 2, but at the moment it isn't Python 3-compatible. 
 This question is similar to  this one , but I am asking specifically about Python 3. 
 
 As I can not delete this answer, I will edit it: 
 Way back when, I created a Python3-port of JayDeBeApi. But as the other answer points out, the official JayDeBeApi now supports Python3 as well. 
 
 Starting from version 0.2 the official  JayDeBeApi  now supports Python 3 as well. It is still backwards compatible with Python 2 and Jython.

Once installed, I used a variation on the code from your reference location here:  Python 3 and MySQL .  I have a schema called "test" and a table called "users", here was the test code:
