*** python-feedparser-how-can-i-check-for-new-rss-data ***

 I'm using the feedparser python library to pull RSS data from a feed continuously.  I've written my python code in such a way that I can ask for a single instance of the RSS data.  Here's my code currently: 
 
 
 What can I add to my code so that it will only check for new RSS data if and only if the RSS has been modified? 
 Let's say I have a list of 10 RSS items, and the RSS feed has been updated with 2 new RSS items.  How can I only add those 2 items to the rssDataList I've created?  I don't want to keep adding the same RSSs to my database. 
 
 
 Regarding downloading only if/when the feed changed, you can use the  HTTP header's    and as fallback also  . 
 
 You can specify them in your call to  . If they are still the same (no changes), the request will have the status code 304 (not modified). 
 It boils down to this example: 
 
 Notes:
You need to check if   and   exists. 
 The   library will automatically send the   header with the provided   parameter and   with the   value for you.

 Well there are a lot of different ways to tackle this. One of the easiest IMO would be to generate a unique "hash" of the most recent entry. For example: 
 
 Then if you do something like so: 
 
 This way, whenever you check the feed again if the hash is different you know it's been updated. Saves the headache of doing time/date comparisons.
