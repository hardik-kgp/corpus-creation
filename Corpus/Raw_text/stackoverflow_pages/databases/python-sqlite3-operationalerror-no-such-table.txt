*** python-sqlite3-operationalerror-no-such-table ***

 I am trying to store data about pupils at a school. I've done a few tables before, such as one for passwords and Teachers which I will later bring together in one program.   
 I have pretty much copied the create table function from one of these and changed the values to for the Pupil's information. It works fine on the other programs but I keep getting: 
 
 when I try to add a pupil to the table, it occurs on the line: 
 
 I look in the folder and there is a file called   and the table has already been created before, so I don't know why it isn't working. 
 Here is some of my code, if you need more feel free to tell me so, as I said it worked before so I have no clue why it isn't working or even what isn't working: 
 
 
 You are assuming that the current working directory is the same as the directory your script lives in. It is not an assumption you can make. Your script is opening a  new  database in a different directory, one that is empty. 
 Use an absolute path for your database file. You can base it on the absolute path of your script: 
 
 You can verify what the current working directory is with   if you want to figure out where instead you are opening the new database file; you probably want to clean up the extra file you created there.
