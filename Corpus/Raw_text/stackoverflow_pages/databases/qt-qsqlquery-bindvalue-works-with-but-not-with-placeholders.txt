*** qt-qsqlquery-bindvalue-works-with-but-not-with-placeholders ***

 I'm working with SQLite, doing insert into table. Folowwing 
 
 works, but 
 
 don't. testQuery.lastError().text() returns  **No query Unable to fetch row**

 Have no clue why things are that way, but really want to find out. 
 
 Please use prepare as the  official example : 
 
 The reason for the error is that the query was executed before binding to the corresponding placeholder. You can see the relevant part of the  constructor documentation : 
 
 If query is not an empty string, it will be executed.
