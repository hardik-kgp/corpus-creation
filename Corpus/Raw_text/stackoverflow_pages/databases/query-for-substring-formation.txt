*** query-for-substring-formation ***

 I want to take the   part of a string   using SQL. What should be the query for this, where the length before the   varies? That is, it may be   or  . Basically, I want part after the  . 
 
 This is one of those examples of how there's similar functionality between SQL and the various extensions, but are just different enough that you can not guarantee portability between all databases. 
 The  SUBSTRING keyword, using PostgreSQL syntax (no mention of pattern matching) is ANSI-99 .  Why this took them so long, I dunno... 
 The crux of your need is to obtain a substring of the existing column value, so you need to know what the database substring function(s) are called. 
 **Oracle**

 
 
 Oracle doesn't have a RIGHT function, with is really just a wrapper for the substring function anyway.  But  Oracle's SUBSTR  does allow you to specify a negative number in order to process the string in reverse (end towards the start). 
 **SQL Server**

 
 Two options -  SUBSTRING , and  RIGHT : 
 
 For brevity, RIGHT is ideal.  But for portability, SUBSTRING is a better choice... 
 **MySQL**

 
 Like SQL Server, three options -  SUBSTR ,  SUBSTRING , and  RIGHT : 
 
 **PostgreSQL**

 
 PostgreSQL only has  SUBSTRING : 
 
 ...but it does support limited pattern matching, which you can see is not supported elsewhere. 
 **SQLite**

 
 SQLite only supports  SUBSTR : 
 
 **Conclusion**

 
 Use RIGHT if it's available, while SUBSTR/SUBSTRING would be better if there's a need to port the query to other databases so it's explicit to others what is happening and should be easier to find equivalent functionality. 
 
 If it's always the last 2 characters then use   in most SQL dialects 
 
 to get 01 from abcd_01 you should write this way (assuming column name is col1) 
 
 SELECT substring(col1,-2) FROM TABLE 
 
 this will give you last two chars.
