*** query-if-android-database-exists ***

 I have created a database for my android app which contains static data and does not require update/delete functionality thus when the app starts, I want to check if the db exists and if not then execute my dbAdapter class. I know its a simple if statement but I was just wondering the most efficient way to query whether the db exists.

 where DB_FULL_PATH is the path to your database file. 
 And the reason I am not just checking if a file exists is because it would not tell whether (a) it's an sqlite db file, (b) the file is not corrupt and can actually be read, i.e. due to partial download or however it has been created. 
 
 I'd rather check the existence of the file directly: 
 
 
 When you initialize the below class with: 
 
 That will automatically create the database if it is not present. 
It also allows you upgrade the database by changing the DB_VER to a higher number. 
 Then so you are able to query the database use: 
 
 the above gets you  **db.query()**
 &  **db.insert()**
 etc methods. 
 
 
 it's simple:
Open your database in try block with path of da databse like: 
 
 if an exception occurs then database doesn't exit so create it: 
 
 that's it you are done :) 
 
 I tried the version as provided by Mathias Conradt but I found that to simply check if DB != null is insufficient. I have amended to this: 
 
 
 Create a global database helper class object in your main activity. In the MainActivity's onCreate() function try this: 
 
 
 I have found an even simpler solution:
