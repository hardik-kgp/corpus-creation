*** query-last-day-last-week-last-month-sqlite ***

 I have this table in my Android SQLite DB: 
 
 On   field is stored   in every register. 
 Now I must query last day, last week and last month registers for showing some statistics.
I've been trying something like this  
 
 and this  
 
 and doesn't work :( 
 How can I do it? 
 Can I check if the query is OK by simply forwarding date in the virtual device emulator? 
 Thanks! 
 
 I have found this solution. I hope it works for you. 
 For last day: 
 
 For last week: 
 
 For last month: 
 
 
 This code should get you the previous month 
 
 
 
 On more months, is  **"months"**
 and not  **month**
 like as other said before. 
 
 This code will bring previous week records hopefully
