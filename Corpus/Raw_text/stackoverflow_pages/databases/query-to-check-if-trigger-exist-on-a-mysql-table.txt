*** query-to-check-if-trigger-exist-on-a-mysql-table ***

 Is there a query which lists all the triggers created for any event on a particular table. 
 Say I have a table named  , and I want to list all the triggers creared for any event(say insert/update/delete etc) on that table. 
 Any kind of help is appreciated 
 
 SHOW TRIGGERS 
 
 e.g. 
 
 
 The accepted answer is correct and the most straightforward method, but for an enhanced view of the triggers on a table and more control over what is returned, use INFORMATION_SCHEMA: 
 
 With this, you can filter on things like   (table name),  ,   (insert, update, delete, etc), and a slew of other attributes. 
 As pointed out in the comments above, you'll need to have TRIGGER permissions for this method as well.
