*** query-to-determine-the-size-of-tables-in-a-database-mysql ***

 The website  "How to calculate the MySQL database size"  gives two queries: 
 Determine sizes of all databases 
 
 Determine size of all tables in a database 
 
 The first query works correctly, but the second query doesn't produce a result set.  It just shows the names of the fields without any rows.  How can I modify the 2nd query to correctly show the size of sizes of my tables in my database. 
 
 Replace   with the name of one of  your  databases. 
 And  use single-quotes for string literals , not double-quotes. 
 
 This was a helpful thread. This slight variation on the OP's second recipe returns tables only (no views) and orders the returned dataset by table size---largest-to-smallest: 
 **MySQL**
: 
 
 
 **PostGRES**
: I needed to do the same thing in PostGRES today, and borrowing some help from  this answer  (and another one I lost after closing the browser tab), this is what I ended up with. Adding it here in case it's useful for anyone else. 
 
 
 I Think this is better ..  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/show-table-status.html 
 
 
 Here is a Query I use to give the size of each table in a database.
