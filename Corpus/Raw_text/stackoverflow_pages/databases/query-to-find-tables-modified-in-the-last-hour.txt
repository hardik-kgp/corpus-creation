*** query-to-find-tables-modified-in-the-last-hour ***

 I want to find out which tables have been modified in the last hour in a MySQL database. How can I do this? 
 
 MySQL 5.x can do this via the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. This database contains information about tables, views, columns, etc. 
 
 Returns all tables that have been updated (UPDATE_TIME) in the last hour. You can also filter by database name (TABLE_SCHEMA column). 
 An example query: 
 
 
 For each table you want to detect change, you need to have a column that holds the last change's timestamp. 
 For every insert or update in the table, you need to update that column with the current date and time. 
 Alternatively, you can set up a  trigger  which updates the column automatically on each insert or modify. That way you don't have to modify all of your query. 
 Once this works, to find out if rows from a table have been modified in the last hour, perform the query 
 
 Repeat for every table you want to check. 
 
 InnoDB still currently lacks a native mechanism to retreive this information. In the  related feature request at MySQL , someone advises to set   triggers on each table to be monitored. The trigger would issue a statement such as 
 
 in a table like this: 
 
 Alternatively, if a slight inaccuracy in this data (in the range of one second) is acceptable, and if you have read access to the MySQL data files, you could switch to a setting where   (recommended in any case) and check the last modification time of the underlying data files. 
 These files are found under   in most default installations. 
 Please note, if you decide to take this route, you need to  recreate existing tables  for the new setting to apply. 
 
 I have answered a question like this in the DBA StackExchange about 1.5 years ago:  Fastest way to check if InnoDB table has changed .  
 Based on that old answer, I recommend the following 
 Flushing Writes to Disk 
 This is a one-time setup. You need to set  **innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct**
 to 0. 
 First, add this to /etc/my.cnf 
 
 Then, run this to avoid having to restart mysql: 
 
 Get Timestamp of InnoDB table's  
  has the option to retrieve the UNIX timestamp in Seconds. For an InnoDB table  
 
 You can then compute  **UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW())**
 - ( ) and see if it is 3600 or less. 
 Give it a Try !!!
