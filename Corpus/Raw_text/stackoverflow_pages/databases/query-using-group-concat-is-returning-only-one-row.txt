*** query-using-group-concat-is-returning-only-one-row ***

 This is a query that is supposed to get the user's information, their project's information, and a group_concat of all the image paths that such project is associated to. To add to this, I am only getting the information mentioned from the people the user is following. 
 This is, however,  **only retunring one row.**

 
 **TO COMPARE:**
 The following query  **WORKS**
 in the sense that in the loop it gives all of the user's information and the projects information related to such user. 
 
 When I try to use group_concat it just returns me  **one**
 row and I do not understand why. 
 Can someone help me please? Thank you. If my question was not clear enough, I will elaborate. 
 If this helps, here's an SQL FIDDLE.

I had to shorten my schema a lot. Try both queries to above to see the problem.

 Because you have not used the   clause in your query. When using aggregate functions like   you need to tell the database about the column using which you want your data to be combined. 
 Currently your query is grouping all records and giving 1 record in the output. 
 If you add   in the query then the records will be grouped by unique userid's. I updated your fiddle and it now gives 2 records:  http://www.sqlfiddle.com/#!2/867f6/18 
 Please note: In standard SQL queries, columns listed in the GROUP BY clause should match the column in the SELECT clause (except the aggregate functions).  
 
 Just use   clause in your_query

 It's because you didn't use   clause in the query. So the DBMS will   all rows in one row. Because there is   for example.
