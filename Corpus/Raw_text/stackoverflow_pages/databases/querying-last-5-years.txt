*** querying-last-5-years ***

 I want to query all products sold in the last 5 years. 
It is possible to do it like this: 
 
 But it there also a nicer way instead of calculating all the days and subtract it from  ? 
 
 
 or 
 
 will both give you all the rows from the last 5 years (though you would generally want to add a   to remove the time portion unless you really care whether a row was created on Feb 8, 2007 in the morning or in the afternoon). 
 
 
 Date sub will subtract 5 years from now
