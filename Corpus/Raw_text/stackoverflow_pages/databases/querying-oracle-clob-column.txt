*** querying-oracle-clob-column ***

 I have a table with a clob column. Searching based on the clob column content needs to be performed. However  
   
 fails but 
 
 seems to workfine. How does oracle handle filtering on a clob column. Does it support only the  'like' clause and not the =,!= etc. Is it the same with other databases like mysql, postgres etc 
 Also how is this scenario handled in frameworks that implement JPA like hibernate ? 
 
 Yes, it's not allowed (this restriction does not affect  s comparison in PL/SQL)
to use comparison operators like  ,  ,   and so on in SQL statements, when trying
to compare two   columns or   column and a character literal, like you do. To be
able to do such comparison in SQL statements,  dbms_lob.compare()  function can be used. 
 
 In the above query, the   literal will be implicitly converted to the   data type. 
To avoid implicit conversion, the   literal can be explicitly converted to the  
data type using   function and then pass in to the   function: 
 
 
 how about  
 
 
 Clob's are large datatypes that can store massive data and hence many operators that support varchar operations will not work on Clob, but in PL/SQL some of them do like mentioned here:  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14249/adlob_sql_semantics.htm#g1016221 
 As you can see in the table   is supported in both Sql and pl/sql for clobs, but   is not supported in SQL, but is in pl/sql 
 If you really need to you could convert to varchar in sql and compare like Tom Kyte mentions  here  like this: 
 http://sqlfiddle.com/#!4/1878f6/1 
 
 
 So do not. Because if you want to compare the data - then it may be a situation where one value:   and the second  
And it is for this method different matter!
It returns -1, although in terms of data - both values ​​should not contain.
Would be correct:
