*** quick-sql-question-correct-syntax-for-creating-a-table-with-a-primary-key-in-h2 ***

 I'm currently starting a new Java application using the  H2 database , but I have some confusion about basic SQL use for creating tables.  How do I make a table of entries (strings) each with unique, auto-incrementing, non-null, integer primary keys?  One of the most basic things to do, but I'm not sure offhand what the correct way to do it with H2 is. 
 I blame these for my confusion (specifies more than one way of doing the same thing between different databases; can't figure the right way for H2, though):

 If I'm reading the H2 documentation correctly, this should work: 
 
 Basically, you just want to declare your key column to be of type  .   
 For   type see:  http://www.h2database.com/html/datatypes.html#identity_type 
For   syntax see:  http://www.h2database.com/html/grammar.html#create_table
