*** radius-search-by-latitude-longitude ***

 I have found a bunch of answers for this question using mysql , but I wasn't able to convert anything into a query ms sql 2008 can use.  I have a longitude and latitude column for each row in the database.  I am going to have a latitude and longitude for where the user is.  I want to be able to find all rows that are within x miles from the user's latitude/longitude.  Also when trying to use other queries I found on SO I keep getting the error  -     which is weird , because I'm pretty sure that I have used   before in sql 2008.  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  So far this is the closest  could come up with.

 Create a spatial index on the computed column. This will make things like   efficient 
 
 Like so: 
 
 
 I think you want POWER not POW
