*** rails-3-activerecord-postgresql-uniq-command-doesnt-work ***

 I have following query: 
 
 and gives me the error 
 
 When I  update  the original query to 
 
 so the error is gone... In MySQL  **.uniq**
 works, in PostgreSQL not. Exist any alternative? 
 
 As the error states  .
Therefore, you must explicitly select for the clause you are ordering by. 
 Here is an example, it is similar to your case but generalize a bit. 
 
 So, explicitly include your   clause (in this case  ) using  .  As shown above, in order for your query to return the Article attributes, you must explicitly select them also. 
 I hope this helps; good luck 
 
 Just to enrich the thread with more examples, in case you have nested relations in the query, you can try with the following statement. 
 
 In the given example, you're asking all the cars for a given person, ordered by model name (Audi, Ferrari, Porsche)  
 I don't think this is a better way, but may help to address this kind of situation thinking in objects and collections, instead of a relational (Database) way. 
 Thanks! 
 
 I assume that the   method is translated to a   clause on the SQL.  PostgreSQL is picky (pickier than MySQL) -- all fields in the select list when using   must be present in the   (and  ) clauses. 
 It's a little unclear what you are attempting to do (a random ordering?).  In addition to posting the full SQL sent, if you could explain your objective, that might be helpful in finding an alternative.  
 
 I just upgraded my 100% working and tested application from 3.1.1 to 3.2.7 and now have this same PG::Error. 
 I am using Cancan... 
 
 Removing the .uniq solves the problem and it was not necessary anyway for this simple query.  
 Still looking through the change notes between 3.1.1 and 3.2.7 to see what caused this to break.
