*** rails-3-multiple-database-with-joins-condition ***

 **My environment:**
 Ruby 1.9.2p290, Rails 3.0.9 and RubyGem 1.8.8 
 unfortunately I have an issue when come across multiple database. 
 **The situation is this:**
 I have two model connect with two different database and also establishing association between each other. 
database connection specifying in each model, look likes 
 
 I got an error when meet following scenario 
 
 Errors: Mysql2::Error: Table 'lab.patients' doesn't exist: SELECT  .* FROM   INNER JOIN   ON  .  IS NULL 
 Here 'patients' table is in 'main' database and 'visits' table in 'lab' database
I doubt when executing the code, that Rails is considering 'patients' table is part of 'lab' database [which holds 'visits' table]. 
 
 Well, I don't know if this is the most elegant solution, but I did get this to work by defining   to explicitly return the database name.  
 
 I'm still working through all the details when it comes to specifying the join conditions, but I hope this helps. 
 
 Might be cleaner to do something like this: 
 
 That will pull the appropriate database name from your database.yml file  
 
 Or even 
 
 
 Is your 2nd database on another machine? You can always do as suggested in this other question:

 I'd use the   as proposed by others, but you can define it a little more cleanly like this: 
 
 alternatively you could also use this: 
 
 You have to keep in mind that the latter will execute a query   the first time that class is loaded.
