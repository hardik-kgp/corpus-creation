*** rails-db-migration-how-to-drop-a-table ***

 I added a table that I thought I was going to need, but now no longer plan on using it. How should I remove that table? 
 I've already run migrations, so the table is in my database. I figure   should be able to handle this, but I haven't figured out how yet. 
 I've tried:   
 
 but that just generated an empty migration. 
 What is the "official" way to drop a table in Rails? 
 
 You won't always be able to simply generate the migration to already have the code you want. You can create an empty migration and then populate it with the code you need. 
 You can find information about how to accomplish different tasks in a migration here: 
 http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html 
 More specifically, you can see how to drop a table using the following approach: 
 
 
 First generate an empty migration with any name you'd like. It's important to do it this way since it creates the appropriate date. 
 
 This will generate a .rb file in /db/migrate/ like 20111015185025_drop_products_table.rb 
 Now edit that file to look like this: 
 
 The only thing I added was   and  . 
 Then run   and it'll drop the table for you. 
 
 Write your migration manually. E.g. run  . 
 As for the code of the migration I'm just gonna quote Maxwell Holder's post  Rails Migration Checklist 
 BAD - running   and then   will fail 
 
 GOOD - reveals intent that migration should not be reversible 
 
 BETTER - is actually reversible 
 
 
 While the answers provided here work properly, I wanted something a bit more 'straightforward', I found it here:  link 
First enter rails console: 
 
 Then just type: 
 
 And done, worked for me! 
 
 You need to to create a new migration file using following command 
 
 and write drop_table code in newly generated migration file (db/migration/xxxxxxx_drop_table_xyz) like 
 
 Or if you wanted to drop table without migration, simply open rails console by 
 
 and execute following command 
 
 or you can use more simplified command 
 
 
 
 rails g migration drop_users 
 edit the migration 
 
 
 
 rake db:migrate 
 
 
 I think, to be completely "official", you would need to create a new migration, and put drop_table in self.up. The self.down method should then contain all the code to recreate the table in full. Presumably that code could just be taken from schema.rb at the time you create the migration. 
 It seems a little odd, to put in code to create a table you know you aren't going to need anymore, but that would keep all the migration code complete and "official", right? 
 I just did this for a table I needed to drop, but honestly didn't test the "down" and not sure why I would. 
 
 you can simply drop a table from rails console.
first open the console 
 
 then paste this command in console 
 
 replace  **table_name**
 with the table you want to delete. 
 you can also drop table directly from the terminal. just enter in the root directory of your application and run this command 
 
 
 You can roll back a migration the way it is in the guide: 
 http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#reverting-previous-migrations 
 Generate a migration: 
 
 Write the migration: 
 
 This way you can also rollback and can use to revert any migration 
 
 The simple and official way would be this: 
 
 Now go to your db/migrate and look for your file which contains the drop_tablename as the filename and edit it to this. 
 
 Then you need to run 
 
 on your console. 
 
 Open you rails console 
 
 
 I wasn't able to make it work with migration script so I went ahead with this solution. Enter rails console using the terminal: 
 
 Type 
 
 It works well for me. This will remove the previous table. Don't forget to run 
 
 
 Alternative to raising exception or attempting to recreate a now empty table  - while still enabling migration rollback, redo etc - 
 
 
 
 
 I needed to delete our migration scripts along with the tables themselves ... 
 
 from terminal window run: 
 
 or 
 
 
 the best way you can do is  
 
 then  do the following 
 
 
 Run 
 
 Where   is the version number of your migration file you want to revert. 
 Example:- 
 
 
 if anybody is looking for how to do it in SQL.  
 type   from terminal 
 enter password 
 In console do 
 
 
 
 Please dont forget to remove the migration file and table structure from schema 
 
 if you want to drop a specific table you can do 
 
 otherwise if you want to drop all your database you can do 
 
 
 **Drop Table/Migration**

 run:-
$ rails generate migration DropTablename 
 exp:- $ rails generate migration DropProducts 
 
 **Run this command:-**

 
 then: 
 
 **or if you are using MySql database then:**

 
 login with database 
 
 
 
 
 
 If you want to delete the table from the schema perform below operation --
