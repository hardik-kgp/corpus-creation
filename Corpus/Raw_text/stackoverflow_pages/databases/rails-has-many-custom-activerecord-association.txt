*** rails-has-many-custom-activerecord-association ***

 I have a Teams model and a Fixtures model. The Fixtures model has an away team and a home team.I followed the example in  this answer  and have most things working. 
 
 I want to be able to call @team.fixtures to get a list of all of the teams fixtures, currently @team.home_games gives me the home fixtures and @team.away_games gives me the aways.
How can I write a   similar to  , and is that the best way to do it?

 (Here is a similar question, but with  :  Rails Model has_many with multiple foreign_keys ) 
 
 Also, you could make a class method from it using the id of the Team (if you already have the team_id but not the Team instance object): 
 
 And use it like this:
