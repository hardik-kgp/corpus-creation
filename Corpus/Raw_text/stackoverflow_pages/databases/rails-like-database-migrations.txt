*** rails-like-database-migrations ***

 Is there any easy to install/use (on unix) database migration tools like Rails Migrations? I really like the idea, but installing ruby/rails purely to manage my database migrations seems overkill. 
 
 Just use ActiveRecord and a simple Rakefile.  For example, if you put your migrations in a   directory and have a   file that has your db config, this simple Rakefile should work: 
 **Rakefile:**

 
 **database.yml**
: 
 
 Afterwards, you'll be able to run   and have all the migration goodness without a surrounding rails app. 
 Alternatively, I have a set of bash scripts that perform a very similar function to ActiveRecord migrations, but they only work with Oracle.  I used to use them before switching to Ruby and Rails.  They are somewhat complicated and I provide no support for them, but if you are interested, feel free to contact me. 
 
 There's also a project called  Java Database Migrations .  To get the code check out the  Google Code page for the project . 
 
 I see this topic is really old, but I'll chip in for future googlers. 
 I really like using Python's SQLAlchemy and  SQLAlchemy-Migrate   to manage databases that I need to version control, if you don't want to go the ActiveRecord::Migrate route. 
 
 I haven't personally done it, but it should be possible to use ActiveRecord::Migration without any of the other Rails stuff.  Setting up the load path correctly would be the hard part, but really all you need is the   tasks and the   directory plus whatever Rails gems they depend on, probably  ,   and maybe a couple others like  .  I'd try it and just see what classes are missing and add those in. 
 At a previous company we built a tool that did essentially what ActiveRecord::Migration does, except it was written in Java as a Maven plugin.  All it did was assemble text blobs of SQL scripts.  It just needs to be smart about the filenames going in order and know how to update a versioning table. 
 
 This project is designed to allow active record migrations to be run without installing Rails: 
 https://github.com/bretweinraub/rails-free-DB-Migrate 
 Install it (git clone it) and use it as a base for your project. 
 
 Here is a tool to do this written in Haskell:
