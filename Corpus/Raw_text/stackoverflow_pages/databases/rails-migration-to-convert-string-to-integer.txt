*** rails-migration-to-convert-string-to-integer ***

 Is it possible to change a field that's a string to an integer without clearing the data already entered? 
 The current db structure for the table in question is: 
 
 Is this possible using migrations? 
 I'm thinking maybe in the migration drop the old field, create a new one that's an integer - but I'm worried this will clear all of the data already entered. 
 Thanks,

 Do not drop the column, it will clear the data. 
 You can however try 
 
 and if all values in   can be converted to  , it should be fine. 
 If that is not the case (ie not all string can be converted by default), then you can do it in two steps: 1) create a new column, then load the   in there after some conversion. 2) drop company_id then rename the new column. 
 You should be careful with both methods (more so for the second one) and you should probably do it first on a copy of the database, if you can. 
 
 Don't drop the column, use this 
 
 The "hint" you got from PostgreSQL basically tells you that you need to confirm you want this to happen, and how data should be converted. To confirm the changes, use the block above in your migration 
 
 The other answers are correct, yet you can take one step further with the   keyword:
