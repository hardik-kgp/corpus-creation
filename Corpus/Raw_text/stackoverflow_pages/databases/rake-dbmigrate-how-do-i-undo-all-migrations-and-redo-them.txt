 Is there a quick rake db:rollback command for all of the migrations? 
 
 Rolling back all migrations 
 To rollback all migrations the best solution is the one @Claudio Floreani proposed: 
 
 This will rollback any migrations without losing data. Then, run all migrations again with 
 
 
 Resetting the database (this will drop all data) 
 Both methods explained below will drop your database and you will lose all the data in them, so you should only use them if you are sure what you are doing. 
 **Reset**

 
 This method drops the database and runs the migrations again. 
 **Loading the last schema**

 
 This method will drop the database and load the data from the last schema. 
 You can see more information in this post:  Difference between rake db:migrate db:reset and db:schema:load 
 Thanks to @Claudio Floreani and all the users who commented to improve the answer. 
 
 If you really want to  **rollback all of the migrations**
, and not just take the database to a pristine state or to the last schema, you have to run: 
 
 This will actually rollback all the way down every migration and ensure that every migration is reversible. 
 If you now issue 
 
 you will see that all the migrations are still there but they are in a 'down' (not applied) state. 
 Other commands that imply a   or   (such as in the answers by @Orlando or @Alex Falke) won't do any rollback at all: that is, they won't ensure that every migration is reversible. 
 Moreover,   cannot be run while the database is being accessed by other users, while rollbacks can be performed live (even if this is generally not recommended). And last but not least, simply dropping and recreating the database will also delete the schema migrations table: if someone runs   after the database has been dropped, he will be replied with "Schema migrations table does not exist yet" and will have no clues about which migrations can be applied (unless he knows it yet or can list them). 
 
 just use  , that will drop your database (same as undoing all migrations) and reset to the last schema. 
 **UPDATE**
: a more correct approach will be using  . That will drop the database, create it again and run all the migrations, instead of resetting to the latest schema. 
 
 If a permission problem raises (like it happened to me), maybe you could try dropping all database tables like I did with rubymine (just open database tool window, select all tables and right-click -> drop), it should be similar with other IDEs. Some tables like sqlite_master and sqlite_sequence were conveniently ignored in the drop. 
 This allowed me to do  
 
 and everything worked fine. Of course you loose all data!
