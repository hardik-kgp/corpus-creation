 **THE GIST**

 Before performing a massive 40+ GB import of the English Wikipedia, I had to temporarily remove indexes and auto-increment fields from three tables ('page', 'revision', and 'text') to handle the load. Now I have finally successfully imported the English Wikipedia to my local machine and created a local mirror (MediaWiki API). Yay! 
 However, I now need to re-create the indexes and auto-increment fields in less than a decade. Luckily, (1) I took plenty of screen-shots of the relevant tables in phpmyadmin before I removed the indexes and fields; (2) I can explain with extreme precision the steps I took before the import; and (3) this shouldn't be too difficult for anyone fluent in MySQL. Unfortunately, I have no expertise in MySQL whatsoever, so "baby steps" explanations would be extremely helpful. 
 **PRECISELY WHAT I DID (PREPARING FOR THE IMPORT):**

 Steps 1, 2, 3: This image depicts the table  **page**
 before I modified the field  **page_id**
 by clicking 'Change' and un-checking 'Auto-Increment' (in preparation for importing). I performed precisely the same modifications for the field  **rev_id**
 in table  **revision**
 and  **old_id**
 in table  **text**
 but omitted the screen-shots to avoid redundancy. 
 
 Step 4: This image depicts the indexes for the table  **page**
 before I dropped all of them. 
 
 Step 5: This image depicts the indexes for the table  **revision**
 before I dropped all of them. 
 
 Step 6: This image depicts the indexes for the table  **text**
 before I dropped all of them. 
 
 **WHAT I NEED NOW (RESTORING AFTER THE IMPORT):**

 I just need to restore the original indexes and auto-increment fields without waiting a hundred years. 
 Set-up details: PHP 5.3.8 (apache2handler), MySQL 5.5.16 (InnoDB), Apache 2.2.21, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, MediaWiki 1.19.0 (private wiki) 
 
 I really like Wikipedia so I'll try to help. 
 You need to use a lot of  
 
 Add primary keys 
 
 Add auto increments back 
 
 I need the table descriptions for all tables before continuing. If rev_id and old_id are same definitions as page_id then: 
 
 Add unique keys 
 
 Other indexes 
 
 Again, there may be column definitions that change this stuff. You need to provide the CREATE TABLE info.
