*** read-write-to-external-xml-file-in-android ***

 I'm trying to learn more about reading/writing to an XML-file (as a kind of database) in Android. I can't seem to find anything about this so I guess I don't know what terms to look for.  
 My goal is to write usernames and passwords from two editText-fields into the file, then read them (and hopefully succeed validating them) later on when I am going to make a login function for my app.  
 The file I wish to read/write to is located on a server, so this makes it a bit complex for me.  
 If someone could help me find a tutorial about reading/writing to XML-files I would be very happy. 
 Thank you. 
 
 Here is the code to write to XML file: 
 
 and to read data from XML File the do as below: 
 
 
 To create new file in  /storage/sdcard0/your_app_name/  use following: 
 
 
 public class SkillsParser implements AssyncXmlReader { 
 
 }
