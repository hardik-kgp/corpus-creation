 Do you know any free tool which would constitute a  **web-based SQL database generic query interface**
, incl.: 
 
 (mainly) allowing to type in an SQL query and display the result in some nice way 
 the interface should allow for some basic security - allowing only   queries  
 the very need is to support MS SQL Server, but Oracle support would be useful 
 should run against an existing database instance without any re-configuration needed 
 might be simple, no need to browse tables, analyze database columns or anything else you would experience in SQLDeveloper or SQL Server Management Studio 
 
 Platform / language / etc. is of second importance. 
 
 The  StackExchange Data Explorer  has this functionality ( example ) and it is  open source , so you may be able to just install and make use of it, or even extract the relevant code. 
 
 Perhaps something like the  SQL Fiddle ? 
 Obviously, this is mainly for demonstration purposes - it won't help you if you want to install it on top of your own database. 
 
 Re:dash (Redash)  is a promising new open-source player on the market. From their own website: 
 
 re:dash is our take on freeing the data within our company in a way
  that will better fit our culture and usage patterns. 
 Prior to re:dash, we tried to use traditional BI suites and discovered
  a set of bloated, technically challenged and slow tools/flows. What we
  were looking for was a more hacker'ish way to look at data, so we
  built one.
