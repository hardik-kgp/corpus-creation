 I'm looking for a simple, multi-platform, free database browser (ODBC,etc).  This is for those times when I want to interface with a database, and just need a simple way to quickly see what the heck is in it.  Doesn't need to support any vendor-specific features. 
 Too much junk out there and I don't want to play with these things all day.  What do you use? 
 
 I like  SqlDbx  - the personal edition is free.  It supports most of the major databases, and the built in intellisense is useful for queries. 
 
 Dbvisualizer has a free version  http://www.dbvis.com/products/dbvis/download/
