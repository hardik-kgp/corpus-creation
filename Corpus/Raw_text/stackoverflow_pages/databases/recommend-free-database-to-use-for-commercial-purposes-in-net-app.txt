 I am looking for a free/opensource relational database to use on a commercial asp.net 3.5 project. Any recommendations? 
 
 Depending on the size of the project you might be able to get buy using  SQL Express Edition . 
 
 Here's a  comparison between open source databases . 
 
 Firebird  - nice, scalable open source database with one of the best freeware .NET integration. 
 
 PostgreSQL  is licensed under a BSD license, which makes it an obvious choice if your product is commercial. That, and it's a very good database management system. 
 SQLite  also has a friendly licesnse, but it is very different from a traditional SQL DBMS. 
 
 SQLite  is a public domain embeddable database engine that has many options for  .NET language binding . 
 
 C#-SQLite  is a complete rewrite of SQLite ( mentioned  by  Greg Hewgill ) in C#. The Highlight: It's 100% managed .NET code. 
 
 If you are using .NET I would go for a MS engine. SQL Express is garanteed to work good with .NET Now dependes on the size of your poject and the load the engine will be handling.- 
 Hope this helps.-
