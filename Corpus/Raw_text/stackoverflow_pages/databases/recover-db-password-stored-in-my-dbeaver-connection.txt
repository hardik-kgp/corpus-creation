*** recover-db-password-stored-in-my-dbeaver-connection ***

 I forgot the password of a dev instance (irresponsible.. yeah, I am working on it). I have the connection saved in my DBeaver with the password. I am still able to connect using that connection. DBeaver is not showing it in plain text. Is there anyway I can retrieve the password? Asking DBA to reset the password is the last resort. I tried to copy paste to a notepad, copying is disabled apparently. 
 
 **Edit: For DBeaver 6.1.3+**

 The credential file is located ~/Library/DBeaverData/workspace6/General/.dbeaver/credentials-config.json (I was on Mac) and it follows a different encryption strategy than it's predecessors. Please refer the next answer to see how to decrypt. it works like a charm. 
 **Pre- DBeaver 6.1.3**

 Follow these steps (My DBeaver version was 3.5.8 and it was on Mac OSX El Capitan) 
 
 Locate the file in which DBeaver stores the connection details. For
me, it was in this location
 . This file is hidden,
so keep that in mind when you look for it. 
 Locate your interested Datasource Definition node in that file. 
 **Decrypt the password:**
 Unfortunately, everything is in plain text except password; Password is in some kind of Encrypted form. Decrypt it to plain-text using this  tool . 
 
 Or 
 I put together a quick and dirty  Java program  by copying core of DBeaver's method for decrypting the password.  Once you have the Encrypted password string, just execute this program, it will convert the password to plain text and prints it 
 How to run it 
 On Line Number 13, just replace   with whatever encrypted password you are finding in   file for your interested datasource. Compile it and run it, it will print the plain-text password.

 Edit 
 Apparently, this is a "Popular" mistake. So I have deployed an AWS lambda function with the above-said code. Use this at your own risk, you will never know whether I am logging your password or not :D 
 
 Edit 2 
 Even better, here is the UI  http://dbeaver-password-decrypter.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ . This goes without saying, use this at your own risk. Non-Https is least of your worries! :) 
 
 For DBeaver 6.1.3+ the creds are stored in a "json" file now with different encryption. 
 This seemed to do the job for me: 
 
 Pass it the path of your credentials-config.json file on local filesystem, for me it was  
 
 It will output to the console the user+pass for connections.  If you don't know which password goes to which DB you must cross link the id names it also outputs to the sibling   file (which should already be present and unencrypted). 
 
 if there is package declaration just compile
javac -d . SimpleStringEncrypter.java
it will put it in the correct directory structure under the current directory
Then you can give
java -cp . packagename.SimpleStringEncrypter and it will run.
Basic java. 
 Anyway this program is fantastic and saved a lot of time for me.
