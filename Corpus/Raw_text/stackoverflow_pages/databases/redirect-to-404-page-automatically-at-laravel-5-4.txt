*** redirect-to-404-page-automatically-at-laravel-5-4 ***

 i made simple resume site with laravel 5.4 and i wanna if users type anything except my site name and my site.com/panel automatically redirect to 404 page. 
 how can i do that? 
 is there any route to do that or what? 
 i found this code but not use 
 
 
 just add   method 
 
 it's automatically redirect to your  
 
 
 and set your routes too for this particular action/method with get request.
