*** redis-cli-selecting-which-instance ***

 I'm currently running multiple redis instances on one box. Each have their own config, init.d, and listen on different ports. My application(s) have no problem connecting via the redis clients, but I'd like to be able to connect to each one using redis-cli. I couldn't find any information on $:redis-cli [options] in either the redis-doc or on redis.io. Any ideas? 
 
 You can specify the server host and port using -h and -p parameters. E.g.: 
 
 
 Try this Redis GUI management tool, it also have console support -  http://redisdesktop.com/
