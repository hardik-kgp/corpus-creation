*** refresh-reload-database-reference-in-custom-contentprovider-after-restore ***

 I use a ContentProvider in my app and everything works great except for one little issue. I have a backup and restore function that backs up the database to a file on the SD card and then those backup files can be restored to overwrite the current database. This whole process is working, but the ContentProvider still holds the reference/cache to the original database once one of the old backup files is restored. I can't seem to find a way to refresh or reload the database reference in the ContentProvider. I know the restore works because I can see the records in the db with SQLite Editor and when I close and re-open the app, it displays the correct records. 
 Does anybody know a way to do this? Is there a way to close and re-open the ContentProvider that I'm not seeing? 
 
 Are you maintaining a reference to the actual   in your content provider (something like calling   in   and then keeping that reference)?  Or do you get the DB object from someplace like a helper in each provider method? 
 Typically, if you only keep a local reference to the helper and get the writable/readable database instance inside of each method as needed then this problem should go away. If not, perhaps we can take a look at the provider code? 
 Hope that Helps! 
 
 If you are targeting >= API 5 you can get a reference to your   via a  , and run a method specific to your implementation: 
 
 Add the reset method to your   implementation:
