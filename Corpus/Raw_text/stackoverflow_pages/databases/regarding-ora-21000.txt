*** regarding-ora-21000 ***

 I am struggling with an ORA 21000 which says  **ORA-21000: error number argument to raise_application_error of 3739 is out of range**
. 
 This error is coming intermittently.  I am not sure why this is occurring.  This worked absolutely fine earlier, but after migrating to Linux from Solaris, this error has suddenly come up.  Googling it didn't help.  Please help. 
 Thanks in Advance. 
 
  is a method by which an application can raise a custom error in Oracle, which is why there will be no documentation about your error message. 
 This procedure accepts an error number argument, which must be in the range -20000 to -20999. Looks like your application is trying to raise 3739 which is not allowed. 
 This is a defect in your application.
