*** relational-algebra-instead-of-sql ***

 I am studying relational algebra these days and I was wondering... 
 Don't you thing it would be better if a compiler was existed which could compile relational algebra than compiling SQL? 
 In which case a database programmer would be more productive? 
 Is there any research on relational algebra compilers? 
 Thanks in advance 
 
 See  Tutorial D  by C J Date, he also has a good rant somewhere on the evils of SQL. 
 Also see  datalog , although not exactly relational algebra, is similar. 
 
 On my school one student implemented relational algebra parser as a Bachelor thesis. You can test it here:

 It's in czech language but I think you can get a point. 
 I tried to write some Relational Algebra queries and it was much better than equivalent queries in SQL! They were much shorter, simplier to write, more straightforward, more understandable. I really enjoyed to write them. 
 So I don't understand why we all are using SQL when there is Relational Algebra. 
 
 There is indeed research on compiling relational algebra 
 A good place to start:
