*** relationship-type-degree-cardinality-optionality-terms-confusion ***

 I currently studying database i've seen  **degree**
 and  **cardinality**
 uses as same term, or in some other degree is defined as no. of entities involved in a relationship and further catogories as unary, binary and trenary.  
 Some placed degree is defined as The degree of a relationship type concerns the number of entities within each entity type that can be linked by a given relationship type. 
 Cardinality is minimum and maximun number of entity occurrence associated with one occurrence of
the related entity 
 cardinality types as   ,   ,  . or min and max cardinality. 
 Min degree is optionality and maximum degree is cardinalty. 
 what is the difference between degree and cardinaltiy ? 
 In another context cardinality is a number of rows in table and degree is a number of columns. 
 So what i'm i suppose to write if question is asked "Define cardinality ?". 
 Can somebody explain ?  
 
 Ok here is the explanation 
 1.Degree. This is the number of entities involved in the relationship and it is usually 2 (binary relationship) however Unary and higher degree relationships can be exists. 
 2.Cardinality. This specifies the number of each entity that is involved in the relationship 
there are 3 types of cardinality for binary relationships  
 
 one to one (1:1) 
 one to many (1:n) 
 many to many (n:m) 
 
 hope this will clear your mind. Please communicate for more information  
 
 To add to the first answer:
Simply 
 Degree of a Relation - Number of attributes in a relation
Cardinality of a Relation - Number of tuples in a relation.  
 Can't post the image to show you but you can check out this book to read up more and get a better picture.  Also there is Connolly and Begg - Database Systems, 4th Edition

 Degree of a Relationship : The number of participating entities in a relationship.  This can be unary, binary, ternary, quaternary, etc 
 Cardinality : The number of relationship instances an entity can participate in.
Ex: 1:1, 1:Many, Many:N 
 (Min,Max) notation : Minimum represents the participation constraints while Maximum stands for the cardinality ratio. 
 Degree of a relation : Number of columns(attributes) in a relation(table). 
 
 **Degree**
 - number of attributes (columns) in a relation (table) 
 **Cardinality**
 - number of tuples (rows) present in a table
