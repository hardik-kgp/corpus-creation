 The problem is that, after creating the new column, I can't do a   because the class doesn't pick up the new column and complains it doesn't exist. 
 How can I make it query the table structure again?

 as obvio171 pointed out, it's quite easy: 
 You need to create a bare model class upfront. 
 Then in the migration you need to call MyModel.reset_column_information,
so that the column information is reloaded so that is up with the new table you just created (or changed) 
 You can then use just every method to create new records. 
 I use something like: 
 
 But if your seed data is more than a few constants,
then you should probably not burry your data into a migration like this.
