*** remove-double-quotes-from-the-return-of-a-function-in-postgresql ***

 I have the following function in PostgreSQL 
 
 When I execute it I receive the values surrounded by double quotes. For example: 
 
 in return I get a table like this 
 
 The values in the 'title' column are in JSON format: 
{ "en-US":"gasoline", "fr-FR":"essence" }.
How I can omit the double quotes to return just the string of the result? 
 
 The   operator returns a   result. Casting it to   leaves it in a json reprsentation. 
 The   operator returns a   result. Use that instead.
