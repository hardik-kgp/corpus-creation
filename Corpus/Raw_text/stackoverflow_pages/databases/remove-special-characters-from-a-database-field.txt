*** remove-special-characters-from-a-database-field ***

 I have a database with several thousand records, and I need to strip down one of the fields to ensure that it only contains certain characters (Alphanumeric, spaces, and single quotes). What SQL can I use to strip any other characters (such as slashes, etc) from that field in the whole database? 
 
 
 That's a good place to start. 
 
 The Replace() function is first choice.  However, Special Characters can sometimes be tricky to write in a console.  For those you can combine Replace with the Char() function. 
 e.g. removing â‚¬ 
 
 You can find all the  Ascii values here   
 Ideally you could do a regex to find all the special chars, but apparently  that's not possible with MySQL. 
 Beyond that, you'd need to run it through your favorite scripting language. 
 
 This may also be useful. 
 First you have to know the character set of the database and / or of the table.  For example, let us suppose you have a UTF-8 environment and you want to strip / remove symbols like circled registered symbols, circled copyright symbol, and registered trademark symbol from a field then search the internet via bing or yahoo or google for for the hex code values of these symbols in the UTF-8 system: 
 
Symbol                       Utf-8 Hex
=======                      =========
circled copyright              C2A9
circled registered             C2AE
Trademark (i.e., TM)           E284A2
 
 Then your scrubbing select sql for field f1 from table t1, using the hex / unhex facility in conjunction with the replace function, will most likely look like this: 
 
 Above, note the original field to be scrubbed / cleansed is f1, the table is t1 and the output header is cleanf1.  The "as char" casting is necessary because, w/o it, the mysql 5.5.8 on which I tested is returning blob.  Hope this helps 
 
 I have created simple function for this  
 
 **Usage example:**

 
 
 Elaborating on Vinnies answer... you can use the following (note the escaping in the last two statements... 
 
 
 Have a look at  LIB_MYSQLUDF_PREG  which needs to be compiled into the MySQL server, but has advanced regular expression facilities such as   which will help with your task. 
 
 My version of MySQL doesn't have REGEXP_REPLACE(). I used the following two workarounds:
1. Remove specified characters (if you know what characters you want to remove) 
 
 
 Keep only the characters you want: 
 
 
 
 There is no regular expression replacement. Use the following code to replace all special characters with '-'.  
 
 Code formatted  
 
 
 This might be useful. 
 This solution doesn't involves creating procedures or functions or lengthy use of replace  within replace. Instead we know that all the ASCII characters that doesn't involves special character lies within ASCII codes \x20-\x7E (Hex representation). Source
 ASCII From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Below are all those characters in that interval. 
 
 so as simple regular expression replace will do the job 
 
 **PHP**
 Custom query string 
 
 The above statement replaces the content in between brackets as well as brackets. 
 PS: I you are doing any DML (select, update ...) operation using prepare statement in stored procedure OR through PHP (creating a custom query string); then remember to escape the slash i.e.  
 
 The above SQL statement does a simple regular expression replaces (actually removes) of all the special character; i.e. In the SQL a REGEX pattern is mention of all the special characters to be replaced with nothing.  
 **Explanation of the pattern**

 A character group is started with the square bracket. The first character is caret which means; negation of all the characters mention in the group (i.e. with in the squares brackets). This simply means select compliment (other character than those selected) of all the characters in the group.  
 Just to summarize the above statement will  
 **Unchanged**
: all the alphanumeric characters, punctuation characters, arithmetic operators. 
 **Remove**
 all the Unicode characters (other than Latin alphabets) or special characters.
