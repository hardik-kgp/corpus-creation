*** remove-uniqueness-of-index-in-postgresql ***

 In my PostgreSQL database I have a unique index created this way: 
 
 Is there way to alter the index to remove the unique constraint? I looked at  ALTER INDEX documentation  but it doesn't seem to do what I need. 
 I know I can remove the index and create another one, but I'd like to find a better way, if it exists. 
 
 You may be able to remove the unique  , and not the   itself. 
 Check your   via  
 Then if you find one, you should be able to drop it like: 
 
 Edit: a related issue is described in  this question 
 
 Assume you have the following: 
 
 To drop the UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, you would use  ALTER TABLE : 
 
 To drop the PRIMARY KEY, you would also use  ALTER TABLE : 
 
 To drop the UNIQUE [index], you would use  DROP INDEX : 
 
 
 I don't think it's possible... even in the pgAdmin III UI, if you try to edit a constraint created with your statement, the "Unique" box is greyed-out; you can't change it through the UI. Combined with your research on the ALTER INDEX docs, I'd say it can't be done.
