*** replacing-values-greater-than-a-number-in-pandas-dataframe ***

 I have a large dataframe which looks as: 
 
 I want to replace each element greater than 9 with 11. 
 So, the desired output for above example is: 
 
 Edit: 
 My actual dataframe has about 20,000 rows and each row has list of size 2000. 
 Is there a way to use   function for each row? I assume that it will be faster than   method?  
 
 You can use   with  : 
 
 Faster solution is first convert to   and then use  : 
 
 
 Very simply :  
 
 You can use numpy indexing, accessed through the   function. 
 
 where you are replacing any value greater than x with the value of y.  
 So for the example in the question: 
 
 
 I came for a solution to replacing each element larger than h by 1 else 0, which has the simple solution: 
 
 (This does not solve the OP's question as all df <= h are replaced by 0.)
