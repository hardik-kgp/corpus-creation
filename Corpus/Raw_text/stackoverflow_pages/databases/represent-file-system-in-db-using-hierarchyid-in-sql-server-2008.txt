*** represent-file-system-in-db-using-hierarchyid-in-sql-server-2008 ***

 I haven't found any specific examples of this but I am interested in representing a whole directory structure with updates, etc using the hierarchyid datatype. This is a common use case cited for the hierarchyid but I can't find any articles building such an example. 
 I just want to represent a whole directory structure such as: 
 
 ** I am not trying to synch this with a file system on disk. It is purely represented through the database. ** 
 
 **Here is an example of representing a file system through hierarchyid**
:  
 
 **Load data:**
  
 
 **Show the paths:**
  
 
 **Get ancestors of file2 (up one level):**

 
 **Get all descentants of dir2:**

 
 **Get the root path:**
  
 
 **Get the level of file2:**
