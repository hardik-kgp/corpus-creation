*** reset-mysql-field-to-default-value ***

 Is there a command in MySQL to reset a field to its default value? You know, in favor of the "Do Not Repeat Yourself" rule, I don't want to write the (quite long) default value multiple times in code, only once in the DB. 
 I looked around quite some time in google, found nothing. I'm starting to suspect such command doesn't exist, but nevertheless, if it does, sy here's going to know about it. :) 
 
 MySQL has a    keyword  (and  function ) that will do exactly what you want.
