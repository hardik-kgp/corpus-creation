 Is there a rake command to wipe out the data in the database tables? 
 How do I create a db:seed script to pre-fill data to my tables? 
 
 I use   which drops and then recreates the database and includes your seeds.rb file.

 You can delete everything and recreate database + seeds with both:  
 
 : loads from schema.rb 
 : loads from migrations 
 
 Make sure you have no connections to db (rails server, sql client..) or the db won't drop. 
 schema.rb is a snapshot of the current state of your database generated by: 
 
 
 If you don't feel like dropping and recreating the whole shebang just to reload your data, you could use   (or  ) in the seed.db file to clean out a table before your   statements load the data.  Then, you can redo the   operation over and over.  (Obviously, this only affects the tables you've loaded data into, not the rest of them.) 
 There's a "dirty hack" at  https://stackoverflow.com/a/14957893/4553442  to add a "de-seeding" operation similar to migrating up and down... 
 
 As of Rails 5, the   commandline tool has been aliased as   so now 
  instead of  
 will work just as well 
 
 You can use   when you want to drop the local database and start fresh with data loaded from  . This is a useful command when you are still figuring out your schema, and often need to add fields to existing models. 
 Once the reset command is used it will do the following:
Drop the database:  
Load the schema:  
Seed the data:  
 But if you want to completely drop your database you can use  . Dropping the database will also remove any schema conflicts or bad data. If you want to keep the data you have, be sure to back it up before running this command.
