*** restricting-a-column-to-accept-only-2-values ***

 I have a column called "Patient Type" in a table. I want to make sure that only 2 values can be inserted in to the column , either opd or admitted, other than that, all other inputs are not valid.  
 Below is an example of what I want 
 
 How do I make sure that the column only accepts "opd" or "admitted" as the data for "Patient Type" column. 
 
 You need a check constraint. 
 
 You need to check if it works though in MySQL in particular as of today. 
Seems it does not work (or at least it did not a few years ago). 
 MySQL CHECK Constraint 
 CHECK constraint in MySQL is not working 
 MySQL CHECK Constraint Workaround 
 Not sure if it's fixed now. 
 If not working, use a trigger instead of a check constraint. 
 
 I'm not a MySQL dev, but I think this might be what you're looking for.
 ENUM 
 
 While creating the table use Enum as data type for patientType column.
