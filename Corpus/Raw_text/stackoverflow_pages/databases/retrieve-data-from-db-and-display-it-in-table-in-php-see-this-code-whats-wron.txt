 **Notes, Cautions and Caveats**

 Your initial solution did not show any obvious santisation of the values before passing them into the Database. This is how SQL Injection attacks (or even un-intentional errors being passed through SQL) occur. Don't do it! 
 Your database does not seem to have a Primary Key. Whilst these are not, technically, necessary in all usage, they are a good practice, and make for a much more reliable way of referring to a specific row in a table, whether for adding related tables, or for making changes within that table. 
 You need to check every action, at every stage, for errors. Most PHP functions are nice enough to have a response they will return under an error condition. It is your job to check for those conditions as you go - never assume that PHP will do what you expect, how you expect, and in the order you expect. This is how accident happen... 
 My provided code above contains alot of points where, if an error has occured, a message will be returned. Try it, see if any error messages are reported, look at the Error Message, and, if applicable, the Error Code returned and do some research. 
 Good luck. 
 
 This is a very simple code I use and you manipulate it to change the colour and size of the table as you see fit. 
 First connect to the database: 
 
 It's a very elementary piece of code but it helps if you are not used to using functions. 
 
 Here is the solution total html with php and database connections 
 
 
 In your while statement just replace   with   or  ... whichever works... 
 
 
 
 When you are connecting database you are not passing your connection variable. That is the error
