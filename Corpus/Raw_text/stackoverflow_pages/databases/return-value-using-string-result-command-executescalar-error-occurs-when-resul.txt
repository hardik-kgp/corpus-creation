 I want to fetch 1st row 1st cell value from database it works well with below code . But when there is no result found it throws Exception. 
 How to handle with   . 
Should i change my query ? which return some value if theirs no record ? 
 System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. 
 **Code:**

 
 
 There is no need to keep calling   as   is already a string. 
 Aside that, this line could possibly be your problem: 
 
 If there are no rows   will return   so you need to do some checking. 
 For instance: 
 
 
 If the first cell returned is a  , the result in .NET will be  
 If  no cells are returned , the result in .NET will be  ; you cannot call   on a  . You can of course capture what   returns and process the   /   / other cases separately. 
 Since you are grouping etc, you presumably could potentially have more than one group. Frankly I'm not sure   is your best option here... 
 
 Additional: the sql in the question is bad in many ways: 
 
 sql injection 
 internationalization (let's hope the client and server agree on what a date looks like) 
 unnecessary concatenation in separate statements 
 
 I strongly suggest you parameterize; perhaps with something like "dapper" to make it easy: 
 
 all problems solved, including the "no rows" scenario. The dates are passed as dates (not strings); the injection hole is closed by use of a parameter. You get query-plan re-use as an added bonus, too. The   here is redundant, BTW - if there is only one group (via the equality condition) you might as well just select  . 
 
 Try this one 
 
 
 You can use like the following 
 
 
 Value is not null, but DBNull.Value. 
 
 
 try this  :  
 
 
 This should work: 
 
 Also, I'd suggest using Parameters in your query, something like (just a suggestion): 
 
 
 Use SQL server isnull function 
 
 
 There is a advance feature of c#, use that '?.' .
string getValue = cmd.ExecuteScalar()?.ToString();  thants all. 
 
 To work with NpgsqlCommand or the standard sqlCommand use: 
 
 
 Try this one, if null set 0 or something
