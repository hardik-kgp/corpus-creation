 Which of the following two is more accurate? 
 
 
 Those two requires aren't equivalent. The equivalent version of the first one would be: 
 
 In that case, I would expect that version to be slightly faster than the second one, simply because it has fewer rows to count. But you are not likely going to be able to measure a difference. 
 Both queries are based on exactly the same data, so they will be equally accurate. 
 
 The following query is very helpful 
 
 
 They definitely may give different results. The better one is 
 
 It's because it includes connections to WAL sender processes which are treated as regular connections and count towards  . 
 See  max_wal_senders 
 
 Number of TCP connections will help you. Remember that it is not for a particular database  
 
 
 From looking at the source code, it seems like the pg_stat_database query gives you the number of connections to the current database for all users. On the other hand, the pg_stat_activity query gives the number of connections to the current database for the querying user only.
