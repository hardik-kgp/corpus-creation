*** rock-mongo-mongodb-config-settings ***

 I have installed  **RockMongo**
  http://code.google.com/p/rock-php/  to manage my  **mongoDB**
 database. This is installed in a subdirectory of my site  http://mongo.example.com . The default config settings are as follows: 
 
 "host" => "192.168.1.1", // Replace your MongoDB host ip or domain name here 
  "port" => "27017", // MongoDB connection port 
  "username" => null, // MongoDB connection username 
  "password" => null, // MongoDB connection password    
 
 I'm not really sure what I should be changing these to? On log in all I get is: 
 
 MongoDB connection exception: connecting to mongodb://192.168.1.1:27017 failed: Operation now in progress. Please check your configuration. 
 
 
 This is what I see from the  wiki 
 
 Login with admin username and
  password, which is set "admin" and
  "admin" as default 
 
 
 I got it working: 
 
 Reinstalled mongodb properly 
 Cleared browser cache 
 Restarted server 
 Set host to 'localhost' 
 
 
 Try to set below configuration in config.php file
