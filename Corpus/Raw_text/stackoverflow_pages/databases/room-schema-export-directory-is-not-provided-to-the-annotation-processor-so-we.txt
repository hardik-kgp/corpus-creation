*** room-schema-export-directory-is-not-provided-to-the-annotation-processor-so-we ***

 I am using Android Database Component Room 
 I've configured everything, but when I compile, Android Studio gives me this warning: 
 
 Schema export directory is not provided to the annotation processor so
  we cannot export the schema. You can either provide
    annotation processor argument OR set
  exportSchema to false. 
 
 As I understand it is location where DB file will be located 
 How can it affect my app ? What is best practice here ? Should I use default location (  value) ? 
 
 As per the  docs : 
 
 You can set annotation processor argument (room.schemaLocation) to tell Room to export the schema into a folder. Even though it is not mandatory, it is a good practice to have version history in your codebase and you should commit that file into your version control system (but don't ship it with your app!). 
 
 So if you don't need to check the schema and you want to get rid of the warning, just add   to your  , as follows. 
 
 If you follow @mikejonesguy  answer  below, you will follow the good practice mentioned in the docs :).
Basically you will get a   file in your   folder.
And it looks something like this: 
 
 If my understanding is correct, you will get such a file with every database version update, so that you can easily follow the history of your db. 
 
 In the   file for your app module, add this to the   section (under the   section). This will write out the schema to a   subfolder of your project folder. 
 
 Like this: 
 
 
 Kotlin? Here we go:  
 
 Don't forget about plugin:

 Above answers are correct. This version is easy to follow: 
 Because "Schema export directory is not provided to the annotation processor", So we need to provide the directory for schema export: 
 
 Step [1] In your file which extends the RoomDatabase, change the line to: 
 
 
 Or 
 
 (because the default value is always true) 
 
 Step [2] In your build.gradle(project:????) file, inside the  **defaultConfig{ }**
 (which is inside  **android{ }**
 big section), add the  **javaCompileOptions{ }**
 section, it will be like: 
 
 
 **$projectDir**
:is a variable name, you cannot change it. it will get your own project directory 
 **schemas**
:is a string, you can change it to any you like. For example:
 
 
 @mikejonesguy  answer  is perfect, just in case you plan to test room migrations (recommended), add the schema location to the source sets. 
 
 In your build.gradle file you specify a folder to place these
  generated schema JSON files. As you update your schema, youâ€™ll end up
  with several JSON files, one for every version. Make sure you commit
  every generated file to source control. The next time you increase
  your version number again, Room will be able to use the JSON file for
  testing.

 **build.gradle**

 
 
 I use   Gradle files (Kotlin Gradle DSL) and the   plugin but I still get a script compilation error when I use Ivanov Maksim's answer. 
 
 For me this was the only thing which worked: 
 
 
 Probably you didn't add your room class to child   child class in
