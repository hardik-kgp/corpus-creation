*** row-count-of-a-column-family-in-cassandra ***

 Is there a way to get a row count (key count) of a single column family in Cassandra? get_count can only be used to get the column count. 
 For instance, if I have a column family containing users and wanted to get the number of users. How could I do it? Each user is it's own row. 
 
 If you are working on a large data set and are okay with a pretty good approximation, I highly recommend using the command: 
 
 This will dump out a list for each column family looking like this: 
 
 The "Number of Keys (estimate)" row is a good guess across the cluster and the performance is a lot faster than explicit count approaches. 
 
 If you are using an order-preserving partitioner, you can do this with get_range_slice or get_key_range. 
 If you are not, you will need to store your user ids in a special row. 
 
 I found an excellent article on this here..  http://www.planetcassandra.org/blog/post/counting-keys-in-cassandra 
 select count(*) from cf limit 1000000 
 Above statement can be used if we have an approximate upper bound known before hand. I found this useful for my case. 
 
 [Edit: This answer is out of date as of Cassandra 0.8.1 -- please see the  Counters entry  in the Cassandra Wiki for the correct way to handle Counter Columns in Cassandra.] 
 I'm new to Cassandra, but I have messed around a lot with Google's App Engine.  If no other solution presents itself, you may consider keeping a separate counter in a platform that supports atomic increment operations like memcached.  I know that Cassandra is working on atomic counter increment/decrement functionality, but it's not yet ready for prime time. 
 I can only post one hyperlink because I'm new, so for progress on counter support see the link in my comment below. 
 Note that this thread suggests ZooKeeper, memcached, and redis as possible solutions.  My personal preference would be memcached.

 There is always map/reduce but that probably goes without saying.  If you have that with hive or pig, then you can do it for any table across the cluster though I am not sure tasktrackers know about cassandra locality and so it may have to stream the whole table across the network so you get task trackers on cassandra nodes but the data they receive may be from another cassandra node :(.  I would love to hear if anyone knows for sure though. 
 NOTE: We are setting up map/reduce on cassandra mainly because if we want an index later, we can map/reduce one into cassandra. 
 
 I have been getting the counts like this after I convert the data into a hash in PHP.
