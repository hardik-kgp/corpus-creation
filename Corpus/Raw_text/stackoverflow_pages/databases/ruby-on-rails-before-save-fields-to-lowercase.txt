*** ruby-on-rails-before-save-fields-to-lowercase ***

 I'm trying to change the fields from the form to lower case before they get saved in the database. This is my code but the output from the database is still in upper case why isnt the code working?   
 
 
  returns a copy of the string, doesn't modify the string itself. Use   instead: 
 
 See  documentation  for more details. 
 
 You're not setting   to downcase by running  , because   does not modify the string, it returns it. You should use the bang   method 
 
 However, there's another way I like to do it in the model: 
 
 
  does not mutate the string, it simply returns a modified copy of that string. As others said, you could use the   method. 
 
 However, if you wanted to stick with the   method, then you could do the following: 
 
 This reassigns the name instance variable to the result of calling downcase on the original value of name. 
 
 You need to use exclamation mark after calling method  downcase , if you also want to save result of operation to the variable.
So for you will be usable: 
 
 Don't forget that  .downcase!  replacement works only in ASCII region. 
 
 Other simple example with less code: 
 
 Hope this helps! 
 
 Another solution is to remove the   and monkeypatch the   method 
 
 Then you can say something like
