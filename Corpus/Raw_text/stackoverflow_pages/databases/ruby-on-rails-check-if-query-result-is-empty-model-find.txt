*** ruby-on-rails-check-if-query-result-is-empty-model-find ***

 iÂ´m using ruby on rails and trying to check if a query is returning a value or not. 
 This is the query: 
 
 If the query finds a result, everything is fine, but how can i react on empty results? 
 I tried: 
 
 But i get an error: 
 
 Any Ideas what went wrong? 
 Thank you!!! 
 
 Use this to check for nil as well as empty cases: 
 
 For the opposite case (NOT nil and NOT empty), use  .present? : 
 
 The reason your query returned    instead of   is : 
 
 always returns one result of object   or   if there is no such result, 
 while something like: 
 
 will return you   (which can have 0-n results) always. and    method will work on it 
 
 If no result is found,   returns a nil object, rather than an empty array. To check whether a customer was found, you can use   or simply   or  , since nil is falsy in ruby.
