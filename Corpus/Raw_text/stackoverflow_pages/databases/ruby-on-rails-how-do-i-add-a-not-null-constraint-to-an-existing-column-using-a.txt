*** ruby-on-rails-how-do-i-add-a-not-null-constraint-to-an-existing-column-using-a ***

 In my Rails (3.2) app, I have a bunch of tables in my database but I forgot to add a few not null constraints. I've googled around but I can't find how to write a migration which adds not null to an existing column. 
 TIA. 
 
 For Rails 4+,  nates' answer  (using  change_column_null ) is better.  
 Pre-Rails 4, try  change_column . 
 
 You can also use  change_column_null : 
 
 
 1) FIRST: Add column with default value 
 2) THEN: Remove default value 
 
 
 If you are using it on a new create migration script/schema here is how we can define it
