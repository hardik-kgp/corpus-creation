*** ruby-on-rails-rake-dbmigrate-error ***

 i'm starting to learn ruby on rails using this guide : 
 getting_started   , i created my project and database but when i run rake db:migrate i get this error: 
 
 @mona-Extensa-5230:~/rubyDev/Sites/blog# rake db:migrate 
  (in /home/mona/rubyDev/Sites/blog) 
  ==  CreatePosts: migrating ====================================================
  -- create_table(:posts) 
  rake aborted! 
  An error has occurred, this and all later migrations canceled: 
  private method `String' called for# 
  ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::TableDefinition:0xb7540f30> 
 
 thanks.

 Note that the   needs to be in lowercase ( )
