*** run-a-single-maven-plugin-execution ***

 I thought I was an experienced Maven user, but I am having a mental block on how to do this! 
 I've been able to use the Maven sql plugin to drop, create, and install a schema in a database via plugin executions I've defined and bound to the   phase. 
 However, now I'd like to use that same sql plugin to insert some sample data whenever I want from the command line -- that is, not bound to any lifecycle goal.  There are a few different sets of sample data, so I'd like to define a few different executions. 
 But is there a way to run one of these executions from the command line by using the execution ID perhaps? 
 
 As noted in  How to execute maven plugin execution directly from command line? , this
functionality has been  implemented  as  MNG-5768 , and is available in Maven 3.3.1. 
 The change will: 
 
 extend direct plugin invocation syntax to allow optional @execution-id parameter, e.g., org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-remote-resources-plugin:1.0:process@executionId. 
 
 So, as long as you give your execution an id: 
 
 uses the execution configured in your pom. 
 
 
 But is there a way to run one of these executions from the command line by using the execution ID perhaps? 
 
 No,  not possible . What is possible though is to define  **"a"**
 configuration to be used when the plugin is invoked from the command line using the "special"   execution id: 
 
 And simply call  .  
 See below for the details (from the  Maven 2.2.0 Release Notes ): 
 
 
 MNG-3401  - Starting in Maven 2.2.0,
  goals invoked directly from the
  command line can be configured in the
  POM separately from other plugin
  invocations using a special
    called  .
  Where previously, all configurations
  for command-line goals had to go in
  the plugin-level configuration, Maven
  2.2.0 allows command-line-specific configurations to be separated into
  their own  . For more
  information, see the  Guide to Default
  Execution IDs .
