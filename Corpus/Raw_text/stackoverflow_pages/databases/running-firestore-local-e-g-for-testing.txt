*** running-firestore-local-e-g-for-testing ***

 Is there a way to run firestore locally (e.g. for  **testing**
 purposes)? 
 What would the approach to write tests against the DB (except of using mocks) 
 
 There is not currently, but stay tuned as it's something we want to provide. 
 In the meantime we suggest uses a separate testing project to cover this. The daily free tier per project helps with this too. 
 
 
 **Update Nov 2018**
: 
  Local emulation, at least for the purpose of testing Firestore rules, was demoed  at Firebase Summit 2018  using   and documented under  Test your Cloud Firestore Security Rules . 
 
 It looks like it's along the lines of: 
 
 It seems early-on, as it's not been noted in the release-notes, but I'm sure it's coming along. 
 
 You can run the Firestore emulator by running:  
   
 and then set the   environment variable as per the console output (e.g. run  ).  
 This requires the  Google Cloud SDK  and a Java 8+ JRE installed and on your system PATH. 
 
 for a firestore testing write a js example test.js
you could test write with this format example 
 
 for run execute

 There are two libraries which attempt to facilitate mocking of the firebase sdk. 
 1)  https://github.com/soumak77/firebase-mock 
2)  https://github.com/mikkopaderes/mock-cloud-firestore 
 I currently use the first one, since it seems to have a bit more of the SDK implemented. 
 They're not perfect, but they're currently sufficient for my needs, and are preferable to the other approaches since they're entirely in-process. 
 Note that firebase-mock (#1) does cause a webpack error if used as-is from Webpack/web code. To resolve, you can use option #2 (mock-cloud-firestore), or use the workaround mentioned here (until a fix gets merged):  https://github.com/soumak77/firebase-mock/issues/157#issuecomment-545387665 
 **Other options:**

 3)  Firestore emulator : needs the google-cloud-sdk, and relies on a separate process 
4) Separate test project: relies on connection to the internet, which also means possible quota limitations/costs 
5)  firebase-server : Only supports the realtime-database api, not Firestore
