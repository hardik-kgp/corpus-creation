*** safely-remove-migration-in-laravel ***

 In Laravel, there appears to be a command for creating a migration, but not removing. 
 Create migration command: 
 
 If I want to delete the migration, can I just safely delete the corresponding migrations  file within the database/migrations folder? 
 Migrations file: 
 
 
 I accidentally created a migration with a bad name (command:  ). I  **did not run**
 ( ) the migration, so I decided to remove it.
My steps: 
 
 Manually delete the migration file under  
 Reset the composer autoload files:  
 Relax 
 
 
 If you did run the migration ( ), you may do this: 
 **a)**
 Run   - it is the right way to undo the last migration (Thnx @Jakobud) 
 **b)**
 If   does not work, do it manually (I remember bugs with migrate:rollback in previous versions): 
 
 Manually delete the migration file under  
 Reset the composer autoload files:  
 Modify your database: Remove the last entry from the  migrations  table 
 
 
 If the migration has been run (read: migrated) then you should roll back your migration to clear the history from your database table. Once you're rolled back you should be able to safely delete your migration file and then proceed with migrating again. 
 
 You likely need to delete the entry from the migrations table too. 
 
 I accidentally created two times create_users_table. It overrided some classes and turned rollback into ErrorException. 
 What you need to do is find autoload_classmap.php in vendor/composer folder and look for the specific line of code such as 
 
 and edit path. Then your rollback should be fine. 
 
 
 Should do the job, if you are in development and the desired outcome is to start all over.  
 In production, that maybe not the desired thing, so you should be adverted. (The migrate:fresh command will drop all tables from the database and then execute the migrate command). 
 
 I agree with the current answers, I just wanna add little more information. 
 A new feature has been added to  **Laravel 5.3 and above version**
 that will allow you to back out a single migration: 
 
 after, Manually delete the migration file under  
 This is a great feature for when you run a migration 
 In this way, you can safely remove the migration in laravel only in 2 step 
 
 This works for me: 
 
 I deleted all tables in my database, mainly the migrations table.
