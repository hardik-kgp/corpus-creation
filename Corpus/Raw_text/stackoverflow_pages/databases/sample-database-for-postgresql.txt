*** sample-database-for-postgresql ***

 I am looking for a sample database (schema+data) for PostgreSQL 9. Is there a repository somewhere for sample databases? 
 
 There's a  PgFoundry project  that contains several example PostgreSQL databases. Most of these haven't been updated for a while, but will still work with recent PostgreSQL versions. 
 If you need a bigger database, the  MusicBrainz music metadata database  has full database dumps available for download. 
 
 I just published a PostgreSQL port of the Open Source Shakespeare database:  https://github.com/catherinedevlin/opensourceshakespeare .  It's much more fun than all those other sample databases. 
 
 You can find some in the PostgreSQL wiki:  http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sample_Databases 
 
 I have found:
 http://www.postgression.com/ 
 But the dbsamples main page from pgfoundry disappeared... 
I have rediscovered  http://pgfoundry.org/frs/?group_id=1000150 
 
 I also made a sample PostgreSQL database based on  IMDb . I also tried to update the sample exercises, so that a beginner can learn from it and practice on it. 
 Link:  PostgreSQL Sample Database . 
 
 Many of the examples referenced here or in other places are defunct or require a good number of hoops to jump through to get working (more than I was willing to jump).  
 I finally discovered that the  DBeaver  SQL client has a " Generate Mock Data " tool that can fill in tables with sample data.  It can handle various data types, you can give it strings to use for text, and it handles foreign keys. You can configure large numbers of rows (e.g. 900,000) for insert, and it is also DB agnostic so it should work for mySQL, SQL Server, etc.
