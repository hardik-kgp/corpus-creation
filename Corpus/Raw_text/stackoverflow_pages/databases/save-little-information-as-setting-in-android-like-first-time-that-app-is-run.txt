*** save-little-information-as-setting-in-android-like-first-time-that-app-is-run ***

 I want to save a flag for recognizing that my app is run for the first time or not. For this simple job I don't want to create database..  
 Is there a simple option to do this? I want to save and read little pieces of information only. 
 
 Use  .  
 
 
 Use   or   to save the data but better option is  . 
 For Retrieving 
 
 For Saving  
 
 
 A proper way to do this is by using the Android class   which is used for things like this. 
 Storing Settings 
 
 **Don't forget to apply or your mutations to the settings won't be saved!**

 You can create multiple settings by using different  . The settings are stored on the device so will be available after closing the application. 
 When you try to retrieve   that is not already created, you create a new one. See more behavior like this  here . 
 **apply() versus commit()**

 You can use   as well as  , the only difference is that apply() does not return a   value with if the edit was successful or not. editor.apply() is therefor faster and more commonly used. 
 **What is MODE_PRIVATE**

 You can see all about the different modes  here . For your case   is fine. 
 Retrieving settings 
 
 When retrieving a settings from a   object you always have to specify a default value which will be returned when the setting was not found. In this case that's  . 
 
 I suggest you to go for  SharedPreference  persistent storage. Its very easy and fast storing/retrival for small amount of information.  
 See the code to get the value from SharedPreference  
 
 and to Store value in SharedPreference  
 
 
 You can do one class for example: 
(like a object for instance) 
 
 On your activity call: 
 
 
 What about using   variables globally? 
 You can do this  as given in this tutorial . I know handling Content providers are unnecessary just to keep some flags.  
 Else you can check out  Shared Preferences  provided by Android.  Here's a good example  to get started. 
 This would be my recommendation.
