*** saving-data-as-array-or-individual-fields-php-mysql ***

 I am designing a new system for users/clients and I have in my system user preferences.  Before I start to create code and the database I want to make sure I do the right thing. 
 I have these preferences: 
 
 font size 
 font face 
 font color 
 theme 
 home page 
 dashboard options 
 few true/false options like enable sharing etc... 
 
 and more. 
 My idea was to create each field for each preferences but I thouhgt maybe I can save an object or array instead in a blob. 
 Is it a good idea? 
 
 You could make an auxiliary table to keep references of properties names. Then you can link that table with a merge table — between a user id and the id of one of the properties. Doing so, you can always change the properties. 
 Using Foreign keys you can also “cascade delete” user details that have a property that does not exist anymore. Furthermore, you can ensure that you add only references to valid property names, and you optimize the search by using indexes.  
 Let's say that: 
 
 Now you first select all headers from   by name, or not, and you use the id to select the desired preference value of a user (identified also by id) from  . Notice that when you delete an entry in  , all entries that link to the id of the deleted row will also be deleted. 
 
 Saving them individually will make searching etc possible on each field. If you serialize them, then searching will become difficult/impossible. 
You may not need that now, but it may be required further down the line.
