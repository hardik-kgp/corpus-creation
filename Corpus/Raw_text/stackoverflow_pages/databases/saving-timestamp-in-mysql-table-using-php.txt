*** saving-timestamp-in-mysql-table-using-php ***

 I have a field in a MySQL table which has a   data type. I am saving data into that table. But when I pass the timestamp ( ) to the record, it automatically saves the value   into that table. 
 How can I store the timestamp in a MySQL table? 
 Here is my   statement: 
 
 
 pass like this 
 
 
 Hey there, use the   function for this. 
 Like this: 
 
 
 
 
 Some things to clarify: 
 
 MySQL timestamp field type doesn't store unix timestamps but rather a datetime-kind value. 
 UNIX timestamp is a number of a regular int type. 
 The timestamp you're talking about is not a regular unix timestamp but a timestamp with milliseconds.  
 
 therefore the correct answer would be  
 
 
 Datatype ' **bigint unsigned**
' may suit this requirement. 
 
 I'm guessing that the field you are trying to save the value in is a datetime field  **it's not but the same seems to be true for timestamps**
. If so mysql expects the format to be Year-month-day Hour:minute:second. In order to save the timestamp you will have to convert the field to numeric using a query like 
 
 If you are using the current time you can use now() or current_timestamp. 
 
 Use  . 
 Note: 1299762201428 looks more like a millisecond-timestamp (like Date()*1 in JavaScript), and you probably have to divide that by 1000. 
 
 Check field type in table just save time stamp value in datatype like    etc. 
 Not   type 
 
 This should do it: 
 
 
 If the timestamp is the current time, you could use the mysql   function 
 
 Use   field type. It comes with many advantages like human readability (nobody reads timestamps) and  MySQL functions . 
 To convert from a unix timestamp, you can use MySQL function  . To convert back you can use  :  . 
 Of course, if you don't like MySQL function, you could always use PHP:  . 
 
 Better is use datatype  . 
 
 You can use   as well in your query, i.e. : 
 
 It will use the current timestamp. 
 
 You can do:  . 
 
 If I know the database is MySQL, I'll use the NOW() function like this:
