 I made a database through sqlite in c++.  
 The db has been created in memory (using the ":memory:" parameter insted of a filename), in order to have a very quick behavior. 
 The database is created by the following lines: 
 
 My problem is: how can I write the in-memory database to disk? (through c/c++ of course). 
 I read something about the ATTACH and DETACH sqlite commands, but I can get them working only with the sqlite interactive shell (not from c/c++ code). 
 Greets. 
 
 Check out this example:  Loading and Saving In-Memory Databases 
 
 Use transaction statement before doing anything to the table. This ensures fast handling and rollbacks as well. This way, you don't need to implement the database in memory directly. 
 
 If you do not have enough time to read the whole documentation posted by @NickDandoulakis's answer, just copy and paste the below function (already mentioned in the link) in your code: 
 
 and then for saving the data of your SQLite db (in memory) into a file call: 
 
 Which   is your database connection object pointer and   is the target file address.  
 **Remark:**
 If you want to load a SQLite database file into memory, just run:
