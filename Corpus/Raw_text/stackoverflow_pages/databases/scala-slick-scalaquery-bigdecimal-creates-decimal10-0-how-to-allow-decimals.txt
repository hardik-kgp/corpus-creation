 How do I tell Slick to create a Decimal SQL type which allows for decimals? 
It seems that by default Slick doesn't allows for decimals which I noticed with the below code. It creates a column with the data type   in MySQL. 
 I have the following model in my Scala code: 
 
 During startup I create this table using Slick unless it already exists with this code 
 
 
 It's not ideal, but you could try this: 
 
 MySQL accepts just  , in which case it creates the field with it's defaults that
happen to be  . I'm not sure if there's any other way to tell Slick/ScalaQuery that you want certain options for your fields.
