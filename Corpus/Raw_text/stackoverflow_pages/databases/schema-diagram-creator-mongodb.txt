 i need to create a schema with all the models of my DB.
I'm using ROR with  **mongodb**
. 
 I'm actually looking for a tool to draw something like this : 
 
 Any Suggestion ? or i've to open paint and adapt ? 
 
 I would suggest to use Visio, as its more flexible. If its purpose is only to do representative figures Visio or even Dia should do the necessary help. If you would like to develop model out of it it won't be possible.

 Today I am using the Glyffy. I adopted as modeling a model like yours, and the great advantage that is realized in glyffy can use directly in Google Drive can share the model with other users.
