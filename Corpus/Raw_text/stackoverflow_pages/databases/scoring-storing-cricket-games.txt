 Two parts to this question: 
 
 Are there any existing file formats or software libraries that can be used for scoring, archiving and/or analysing cricket games? 
 Are there any examples of database schemas suitable for recording all of the details of a cricket game? 
 
 
 Cricksheet offers ball-by-ball match data for the recent year in yaml format. The specification of their yaml format can be found here -  http://cricsheet.org/format/  . 
 But, I really don't understand this  **3 day**
 thing everyone keeps talking about. Test matches last 5 days, One-day matches last, well, one day and T20 matches last close to 4 hours. 
 Only exhibition first-class matches or practice matches are played for 3 days, and I am wondering why anyone is talking about it here if that is what they are indeed talking about. 
 
 As you will know cricket is a complex game and commentator needs lots of stats to rehash over 3 days or more. 
 So short of someone sharing proprietary info, you probably better off designing an XML schema(may be) to store the data. 
 Good luck
