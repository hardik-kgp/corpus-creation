*** select-into-table-will-it-work-for-inserting-data-into-existing-table ***

 I am trying to insert data from one of my existing table into another existing table. 
 Is it possible to insert data into any existing table using    query.
I think it can be done using union but in that case i need to record all data of my existing table into temporary table, then drop that table and finally than apply union to insert all records into same table 
 eg. 
 
 Here tblExisting is the table where I actually want to store all data
tblActualData is the table from where data is to be appended to tblExisting. 
 **Is it right method.
Do we have some other alternative ?**

 
 You should try 
 
 Have a look at  INSERT 
 and  SQL SERVER – Insert Data From One Table to Another Table – INSERT INTO SELECT – SELECT INTO TABLE 
 
 No, you cannot use   to insert data into an existing table. 
 The  documentation  makes this very clear: 
 
 SELECT…INTO creates a  **new table**
 in the default filegroup and inserts the resulting rows from the query into it. 
 
 You generally want to avoid using   in production because it gives you very little control over how the table is created, and can lead to all sorts of nasty locking and other performance problems.  You should create schemas explicitly and use   - even for temporary tables.

 **Can you do this by selecting all columns using *?**

Yes!
