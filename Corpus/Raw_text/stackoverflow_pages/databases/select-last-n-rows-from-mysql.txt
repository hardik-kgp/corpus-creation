*** select-last-n-rows-from-mysql ***

 I want to select last 50 rows from MySQL database within column named  **id**
 which is  **primary key**
. Goal is that the rows should be sorted by  **id**
 in  **ASC**
 order, that’s why this query isn’t working  
 
 Also it’s remarkable that rows could be manipulated (deleted) and that’s why following query isn’t working either 
 
 **Question**
: How is it possible to retrieve last N rows from MySQL database that can be manipulated and be in ASC order ? 
 
 You can do it with a sub-query: 
 
 This will select the  last  50 rows from  , and then order them in ascending order. 
 
 
 If you have a date field that is storing the date(and time) on which the chat was sent or any field that is filled with incrementally(order by DESC) or desinscrementally( order by ASC) data per row put it as second column on which the data should be order. 
 That's what worked for me!!!! hope it will help!!!! 
 
 
 save resources make one query, there is no need to make nested queries 
 
 
 Notes:
*   should be unique.
* You can control the numbers of rows returned by replacing the   in the query
