*** select-max-min-values-from-two-tables ***

 I have two tables. Differ in that an archive is a table and the other holds the current record. These are the tables recording sales in the company. In both we have among other fields: id, name, price of sale. I need to select from both tables, the highest and lowest price for a given name. I tried to do with the query: 
 
 but such an inquiry draws me two records - one of the current table, one table archival. I want to chose a name for the smallest and the largest price immediately from both tables. How do I get this query? 
 
 Here's two options (MSSql compliant) 
 Note: UNION ALL will combine the sets without eliminating duplicates.  That's a much simpler behavior than UNION. 
 
 This one figures out the max and min from each table before combining the set - it may be more performant to do it this way. 
 
 
 In SQL Server you could use a  subquery : 
 
 
 Is this more like what you want? 
 
 It's untested but should return all your records on one row without the need for a union
