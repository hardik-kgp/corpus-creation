*** select-not-in-multiple-columns ***

 I need to implement the following query 
 
 but NOT IN can't be implemented on multiple columns. How do I write this query 
 
 I'm not sure whether you think about: 
 
 it works only if id1 is related with id1 and id2 with id2 not both. 
 
 Another mysteriously unknown RDBMS. Your Syntax is perfectly fine in PostgreSQL. Other query styles may perform faster (especially the   variant or a  ), but your query is perfectly legit. 
 Be aware of pitfalls with  , though, when involving any   values: 
 
 Find records where join doesn't exist 
 
 Variant with LEFT JOIN: 
 
 See @Micha≈Ç's answer for the   variant. 
A more detailed assessment of four basic variants: 
 
 Select rows which are not present in other table 
 
 
 You should probably use   for multiple columns.
