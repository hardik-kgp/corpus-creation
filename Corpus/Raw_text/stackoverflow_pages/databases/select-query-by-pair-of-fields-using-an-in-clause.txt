*** select-query-by-pair-of-fields-using-an-in-clause ***

 I have a table called players as follows: 
 
 I wish to write a select statement on this table to retrieve all rows whose first ids and second ids match a bunch of specified first and second ids. 
 So for example, I wish to select all rows whose first and second ids are as follows: (1,1), (1,2) and (1,3). This would retreive the following 3 rows: 
 
 Is it possible to write a select query in a manner such as: 
 
 If there is a way to write the SQL similar to the above I would like to know. Is there a way to specify values for an IN clause that represents multiple rows as illustrated. 
 I'm using DB2. 
 
 This works on my DB2 (version 9.7 on Linux/Unix/Windows) by using this syntax: 
 
 This syntax won't work on DB2 on the Mainframe (at least in version 9.1) because you can't substitute a sub-select with a VALUES expression.  This syntax will work: 
 
 
 Here's a very similar solution in postgresql: 
 
 
 With compound primary keys, I would concatenate the two ids and match compound strings. 
 
 (If ids are not strings, simply cast them as such.) 
 
 This type of query works in DB2. 
 
 
 
 This worked wonder for me.
