 i've found a few samples on how to do it but they all select distinct on each column individually. 
 
 Assuming that the first column is unique, you can do this: 
 
 See it working online:  sqlfiddle 
 
 **Update 1**

 Better you use this against above. 
 
 **Demo**

 The reason I am saying is because using CONCAT, I am not getting desired result in  **this case**
. First query is returning me 5 rows however CONCAT is returning me 4 rows which is INCORRECT.

 Assumed the columns in the table are (id, col2, col3, col4). 
 
 **OR**

 
 **live working example**

 
 Assuming the columns in the table are  , you could: 
 
 
 This query makes sure that the combination of column1 and column2 is unique, while selecting the minimum value of column three 
 
 
 THe simplest query for this is  
 
 
 Using the group by method is returning me extra rows, where as explicitly checking each field although longer returns the same no of records as count(Distinct ..)
