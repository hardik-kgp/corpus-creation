*** self-join-to-get-employee-manager-name ***

 Hello I have a Employee Table with following columns 
 
 I am trying to create a view which will list  
  (by cross joining the Employee table). I tried outer join, inner join etc, but I am not able to get it right.  
 Any help is highly appreciated. 
 
 
 
 **EDIT**
:
Left Join will work if emp_mgr_id is null. 
 
 
 
 Try this, it's a JOIN on itself to get the manager :) 
 
 
 This definition uses a left outer join which means that even employees whose manager ID is NULL, or whose manager has been deleted (if your application allows that) will be listed, with their manager's attributes returned as NULL. 
 If you used an inner join instead, only people who have managers would be listed. 
 
 
 
 Try this one. 
 
 
 As Jesse said, use self join: 
 
 
 
 
 try this ..you should do   to igore null values in the table 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Additionally you may want to get managers and their reports count with -
