*** sequelize-configuration-to-retrieve-total-count-with-details ***

 I am working with node  **sequelize**
 with  **postgres**
 database.
I am loading paginated records to my UI, now I need to get total records count with the same query which I am using to retrieve paginate records.
Anyone, please give the sample sequelize configuration to do the same.
Please see my expected sample postgres query to clarify my question 
 
 Thanks in advance 
 
 If you want to avoid specifying SQL, you can also use  
 
 You can't do that with sequelize, but you can do through 2 separate queries, one to get the data you need and the other one to get the total count. 
 first one : 
 
 second one : 
 
 if you want to do that in one query which is maybe not the best way (because you adding metadata for each result which is not metadata related to the model) you can create a   like that: 
 
 I hope my explanation will help you :), 
 Have a nice day! 
 
 You can use   for this purpose. 
 
 findAndCountAll - Search for multiple elements in the database, returns both data and total count 
 
 Here is an example: 
 
 This uses ES6 destructuring and spread operators and  /  syntax. 
  is an object with  , and   properties which overwrite default limit and offset. 
 Note that you may need to pass   as well in case you   other models in a query.
