*** set-default-value-of-an-integer-column-sqlite ***

 Is it possible to set the default value of   (which is an integer) for every row created to be   (zero)? If so, what should be the correct code. 
 
 Use the SQLite keyword

 A column with default value: 
 
  is a placeholder for a:

' then entering your desired definition using ' **Default**
' ' **Constraint**
' or it will not work ( I don't know if this is an SQLite or the program requirment ). 
 Here is the code I used:
