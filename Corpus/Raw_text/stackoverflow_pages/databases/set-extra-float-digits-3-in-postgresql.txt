*** set-extra-float-digits-3-in-postgresql ***

 Whenever I start Postgresql DB engine, I have almost 7-8 queries running in the background  
 I am not sure why these are running all the times. I know that the extra_float_digits variable adjusts the number of digits displayed for floating-point values in Postgresql, however I am not sure why these queries run in the background when I start the DB engine. 
 I already have the extra_float_digits = 3 in the config file. Even if I comment it out, these queries still run in the background..  
 need help..Thanks 
 
 The queries aren't really running. As Nick says in the comments, the connections will be in idle state.   shows the last statement that finished running when a query is idle. 
 As for the other part: I'd say you're using PgJDBC.   ensures that PgJDBC doesn't lose precision when it gets floating point values from the database. It's part of the initial connection conversation. It's normal and you can ignore it.  If you're on a recent PgJDBC, send the additional connection parameter   and it'll go away . 
 So what you have there is a bunch of new, idle connections. 
 Look into your application / application server's configuration. Your connection pool probably doesn't have reasonable limits set. 
 
 I've had this problem with Java and Postgresql.
I've resolved this issue by using PGPoolingDataSource and Close connection.  
 Here how I've built my classes: 
 //Class Factory Connection: 
 
 //Class userDAO - class to interact with database 
 
 
 Whenever a new connection is established, postgres triggers this   setting. 
Issue was with my database health check module. 
 
 in my option you can end this connections with a pg-command. For example: 
 SELECT pg_terminate_backend(t.pid)
  FROM (SELECT pid
          FROM pg_stat_activity
         WHERE state = 'idle' AND query like '%float%' AND state_change<(now() - interval '1 hour')) AS t;
