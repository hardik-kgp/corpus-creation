*** setselection-on-spinner-based-on-rowid ***

 I have a Spinner View that's populated through a SimpleCursorAdapter.  
 Based on the selection I need to save the  **rowid**
 in the entry database (position won't work because things can be added and deleted from the Spinner Database).  
 This I can do by using  . But When I edit an entry I need to make the Spinner position selected that is associated with this rowid (currently). 
  won't work because I have the rowid, I need a way to find the current position of the item in the current spinner based on the rowid in the database. 
 
 If you want to set the selection of a   thats backed by a  , you can loop through all the items in the   and look for the one you want (assuming that the primary key in your table is named "_id"): 
 
 If you want to get the rowid of a selected item, you can do something similar: 
 
 There might be a quicker way to do it, but that's always worked for me. 
 
 Had an idea when writing this, made a hashtable with rowid->pos when populating the spinner and then used that. Might help someone if they're searching. 
 
 I agree with  Erich Douglass's  above  **answer**
 but i found fastest loop syntax which will be useful while   is greater than  **50k to 100k**
. 
 
 So i think we can use here second for better performance: 
 
 
 I think that instead of a for loop is better a while, because when you find your item, can break the loop. 
 
 
 First step, create view for your data set, with joins etc.: 
 
 Second step: 
 
 Then simply:

 To get position by id:

 Hope that help

 has provided an awesome answer.. But I am not surprised why nobody has recommended it.. just want to make some correction in his answer.. 
 
 I just replaced "where" with "on" that is required by join.. 
 now u have all the items with their Positions associated with there ID's.. 
 Just assign the ROW_id to the    of spinner 
 
 Why do it the hard way when you can do it the right way? 
 I refer to the manual: 
 http://d.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener.html#onItemSelected%28android.widget.AdapterView%3C?%3E,%20android.view.View,%20int,%20long%29
