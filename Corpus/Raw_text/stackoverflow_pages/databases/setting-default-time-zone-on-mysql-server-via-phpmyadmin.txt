*** setting-default-time-zone-on-mysql-server-via-phpmyadmin ***

 I have a shared hosting mySql instance which has it's system_time_zone set to Pacific Standard Time and it's time_zone variable set to System, hence effectively it's running on Pacific Standard Time. 
 i.e. I've run the following command to find this out:  
 
 I would like to change the default mySql database / local mySql DB time-zone to GMT/UTC time. I tried to run,  , and this does execute successfully!  
 However, this does not seem to affect the time_zone variable, when I check the state of @@time_zone. I've looked at another post dealing with similar issue  How to set MySQL to use GMT in Windows and Linux  and I also checked the  MySql documentation , with little progress. Since I am on a shared-hosting solution, I have limited access and I don't have access to more than what my PhPMyAdmin mySql functionality has on offer.  
 I wonder if there is any way to change the default_time-zone from within an SQL query, or do I need to fall back to the command line (to which I don't have access to, unfortunately). 
 Thanks for your help and advice, 
 Martin 
 
 For shared hosting, you have to ask support-guys to help you and change default time zone for you? I had similar problem with Arcor hosting-provider, called them and they fixed it. Before that, I found temporary solution in   from PHP code. Probably the best solution is to ask someone who has privilege to change that parameter. 
 
 In short,   actually stores ' ' data type fields internally as  . 
 ,   shows you the dates using the server default time, hence your confusion. 
 For example, try adding this line before your SQL statement in  : 
 
 See the   documentation for further details, or the answer in this post:  How to correctly set mysql timezone

 Simply sent the time as VARCHAR into db hope it helps and sorry for syntax errors (if there are any).
