*** setting-network-timeout-for-jdbc-connection ***

 I'm trying to set a network time-out my Oracle database Connection in Java. However, I'm getting an error. Below is sample code and it's respective exception. 
 
 The Exception I'm getting is: 
 
 I believe it has to do with a method being abstract (read AbstractMethodError). What could probably cause this error as I have only implemented the method which I think is already defined within Java, and thus, does not refuse to compile. 
 **N.B.: Java does not allow compilation of concrete classes if there are abstract methods.**
  
 
  was introduced in JDBC 4.1 and was not present in JDBC 4.0.   
 You will want ojdbc7 since JDBC 4.1 only came in with Java 7 if you want to use   method. 
 The underlying issue is that adding methods to interfaces in later specifications can cause older implementations of those interfaces to break with errors.  One of the new features of the upcoming Java 8, default methods, will hopefully make this slightly less of a problem. 
 
 Apparently there is also a JDBC driver property for Oracle that can modify socket timeouts. 
 You can also try using  this Oracle JDBC property  to set the socket timeout if you are using the thin driver: 
 
 
 From the Oracle's documentation: "setNetworkTimeout throws an SQLException if: a database access error occurs, this method is called on a closed connection, the executor is NULL". The latter seems your case. 
 
 This is a classic case of software evolution. The JDBC provider has not given the implementation of the method yet in the jar you are using. Looks like your JDBC library is quite old and you may try the latest one.
