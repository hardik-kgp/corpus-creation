*** setting-up-elasticsearch-with-postgresql ***

 where do I find a howto to set up elasticSearch using Postgres? 
 My field sizes will be about 350mb, yes, MB, each in size.  I have a
text output of all of the US Code and all decisions from all the courts,
the Statutes at Large, pretty much everything you would find in a library,
and I need to be able to do full text searches and return the exact point
in the field to the app to return the exact page in PDF form.  Postgres
can easily handle the datastore, but I've never used elasticSearch and
have no idea of how it integrates into the indexing, etc. 
 
 As of 2015, there's ZomboDB ( https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb ).  As the author, I'm a bit biased, but it's quite powerful.  ;) 
 It's a Postgres extension and Elasticsearch plugin that allows you to "CREATE INDEX"s that use a remote Elasticsearch cluster, and it exposes a fairly powerful query language for performing full-text searches. 
 Because it's an actual index in Postgres, the ES cluster is automatically synchronized as you INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE records.  As such, there's no need for asynchronous synchronization processes. 
 Additionally, because it's an actual index, it is transaction-safe, which means concurrent Postgres sessions will only see results that are consistent with their current transaction. 
 Here's a  link  to ZomboDB's tutorial.  It should give you an idea of how easy ZomboDB is to use. 
 
 There is an application that you can use to import SQL Server, Oracle, Postgresql MySQL, etc. in to an ElasticSearch index.

 Please let me know if you have any trouble building or using it. ~Adam 
 
 Right now, I don't believe there is out of the box integration. You would need to write some glue code to pull data from SQL and submit it into elasticsearch (or vice versa).  
 I'd recommend asking on the google groups elastic search forum:

 Shay Banon, the main contributor/maintainer is extremely helpful.
