*** setting-up-master-slave-replication-databases-within-my-vagrant-box ***

 Currently, I am using Vagrant 1.4.3 in-conjunction with VirtualBox running Unix (Centos) for my development server (using MariaDB).  
 I didn't setup the box myself (so my knowledge of setting this up is limited) I would basically like to do the following (if this is possible)... 
 Please note I can appreciate that a  **full explanation**
 for doing this might be out of the scope of StackOverflow. 
 Essentially I would like to: 
 
 Run two databases on separate ports that run in a 'master-slave' 
 This setup needs to run within my Vagrant setup 
 
 For instance, let's say 'Database 1' has the port 3306 and will be the master, and 'Database 2' has the port 4406 will be the slave. I want any changes made to Database 1 to automatically be 'pushed' to Database 2. 
 I've never had to do this before. 
 Any advice on the matter would be appreciated, I presume I'm not the only guy who is struggling with mysql-replication :) 
 If it helps - my current vagrant file looks like the following:
