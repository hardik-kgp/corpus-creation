*** sharing-databases-between-projects-within-intellij ***

 I use Intellij to inspect databases, run sql, view data in tables etc. This all works fine but the only thing I am missing is the ability to define these datasources once and view them in all my projects i.e. that I can share them between other projects and not have to redefine them for new projects. Is this possible in Intellij? 
 
 Go to the   tool window and click on the   button. Select the data source you want to make global. Click on the   button in the tool bar above.  
 The   button looks like this: 
 
 Now you can use the data source from all your projects. However a global data source is not stored in the project files, so any other developers working on the same project will need to define their own data source.  
 
 The   button is no longer green (Intellij Ultimate 2018.02). 
 It's located above the datasource list, as in the (crappy) screenshot. 
 
 
 In IntelliJ 2019.1, 2019.2 to share connection to DB with multiple projects:  
 
 Open Database panel 
 Datasource Properties 
 Make Global 
 
 
 So how I did it on 2018.3 was to go to the Database tool window then right click on your datasource you want to copy then Database Tools -> Copy Datasource to Clipboard. In the Database window for the project you want to copy to click the + at the top left and it has an option to Import from Clipboard.
