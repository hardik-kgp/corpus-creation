*** show-all-keys-in-redis-in-one-line ***

 I need to see all available keys in Redis. This question: 
 Redis command to get all available keys? 
 Adequately covers the case where I run   with no arguments, then type  . 
 However, how do I get all keys with a single command?  
  returns: 
 
 (error) ERR wrong number of arguments for 'keys' command 
 
 Even though there are keys set, which checks out if you use the two-command solution. 
 
 You need to do 
 
 to avoid your shell from expanding   into a list of filenames.
