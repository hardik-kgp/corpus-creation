 I'm trying to show all the tables in my database. I've tried this: 
 
 but it only gives me one table name in a database I know has 2. What am I doing wrong? 
 
 How to get tables 
 **1. **

 
 **2. **

 
 **3. Using information schema**

 
 to OP 
 you have fetched just 1 row. fix like this: 
 
 and I think, information_schema would be better than  
 
 
 Try this: 
 
 
 SHOW TABLE_NAME is not valid. Try SHOW TABLES 
 TD 
 
 SHOW TABLES only lists the non-TEMPORARY tables in a given database.
