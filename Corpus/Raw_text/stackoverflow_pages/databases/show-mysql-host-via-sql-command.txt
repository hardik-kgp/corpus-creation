*** show-mysql-host-via-sql-command ***

 
 All good and well, but is it possible to show the current connections host.
Not connection_id, but the IP Address or Name of the host. 
 
 To get current host name :- 
 
 To get hosts for all incoming requests :- 
 
 Based on your last comment, 
I don't think you can resolve IP for the hostname using pure mysql function, 
as it require a network lookup, which could be taking long time.  
 However, mysql document mention this :- 
 
 docs :-  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resolveip.html 
 
 Maybe 
 
 
 I think you try to get the remote host of the conneting user... 
 You can get a String like 'myuser@localhost' from the command: 
 
 You can split this result on the '@' sign, to get the parts: 
 
 if you are conneting via ip address you will get the ipadress instead of the hostname. 
 
 
 That could help you !!
