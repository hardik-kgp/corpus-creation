*** show-values-from-a-mysql-database-table-inside-a-html-table-on-a-webpage ***

 I want to retrieve the values from a database table and show them in a html table in a page.
I already searched for this but I couldn't find the answer, although this surely is something easy (this should be the basics of databases lol). I guess the terms I've searched are misleading.
The database table name is tickets, it has 6 fields right now (submission_id, formID, IP, name, email and message) but should have another field called ticket_number.
How can I get it to show all the values from the db in a html table like this: 
 
 And then all the other values below 'john'. 
 
 Example taken from W3Schools:  PHP Select Data from MySQL 
 
 It's a good place to learn from! 
 
 Try this: (Completely Dynamic...) 
 
 
 First, connect to the database: 
 
 You can use this to display a single record: 
 For example, if the URL was  , the code below would select from the table, where the sequence =  . 
 
 Or, if you want to list all values that match the criteria in a table:

First, start a connection to the database. Do this by making all the string variables needed in order to connect, adjust them to fit your environment, then create a new connection object with   and initialize it with the previously made variables as its parameters. Now, check the connection for errors and display a message whether any were found or not. Like this: 
 
 Next, make a variable that will hold the query as a string, in this case its a   statement with a   of 100 records to keep the list small. Then, we can execute it by calling the   function from our connection object. Now, it's time to display some data. Start by opening up a   tag through  , then fetch one row at a time in the form of a numerical array with   which can then be displayed with a simple for loop.   should be self explanatory. Don't forget to use   for each value, and also to open and close each row with   and  . Finally we close the table, and the connection as well with  . 
 
 Any feedback would be much appreciated! Good Luck! 
 
 
 
 Here is an easy way to fetch data from a MySQL database using PDO. 
 
 
 Surely a better solution would by dynamic so that it would work for any query without having to know the column names? 
 If so, try this:

 it would print the table like this 
just read line by line so that you can understand it easily..
