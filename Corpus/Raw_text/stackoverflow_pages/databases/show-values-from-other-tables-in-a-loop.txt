*** show-values-from-other-tables-in-a-loop ***

 In my database i have 3 tables: 
 **train_information:**

 
 **axle:**
  
 
 **bogie:**
  
 
 When something gets inserted in the   table, a trigger also inserts in the other 2 tables (Distance & bogie_nr get updated later, but in this example everything is filled in already). 
 Now i make a train model based on the   values.
Right now it looks like this: 
 
 And: 
 
 Now, the page looks like this (With the values of the DB): 
 
 The code i provided is only for the axles! (the 4 circles beneath the train)!   
 Now, what i want:   
 Right now, i just ask for the value of the axle table. but it only contains 3 axles instead of 4. This is because i want to know the distance BETWEEN each axle. so i always need 1 less. 
I solved this by making 1 extra div that creates the circle (axle) and places is to the left.   
 What i would like to have is something like: 
show the   from the   table (So it shows 4). 
Get the   where   =  . 
Then you always keep 1 empty. because axle 4. does not exist in the   table.
So i want to make a check: if axle does not exist then distance = 0. I don't want to insert this in the database, but just so i don't need the useless axle div anymore AND the axle stays on the left. 
 Why do i want this? 
This way i can check wich bogie numbers are the same, so i can give them each an other color etc. Also i won't need the useless_axle div! 
 **EDIT:**

 Simple explanation: 
 I want to show the   from the   table. (So it displays 4 circles)
However! i will need the   from the   table in order to make a train figure. 
as you can see the   table has 1 less axle than the   table. 
So i want the "Not existing" axle to have a value of 0. I want it 0 because then it will show up on the beginning of the train. (Just like the useless axle right now) 
 **CODE EDIT:**

 Right now i have got this: 
 
 And:   
 
 And it shows me 12 axles instead of 4! 
 **EDIT:**

 it is showing me 4 axles now wich is correct.
However i also need the correct distances. Code i have: 
 
 Right now, it shows me that every axle has a margin of 10%. this is correct (if you only have the first axle). it needs to be something like 10-15-10-15 or so. How do i do this? 
 **EDIT:**

 Right now i have the folowing query: 
 
 En i call it here:

 It seems to me that this is a rather convoluted way to work around the original problem.  You are shy one axle, and need that axle to be in your database.  You said that all values are added via a trigger in the database.  If that is the case, why not add a value that has a distance of '0' with the id of the train.  This will give you not only the axle, but the rendered div as well. 
 If your table looked like this after generation (please forgive me if the index is off in the wrong direction.  I am struggling just a touch to understand your database layout): 
 
 Then the following whould generate all circles, including the one that has a margin (or distance as you stated earlier) of '0'.  Technically speaking, you have an axle with a distance of '0' from the front of the train, so why not track it in your database. 
 
 Taking this approach both simplifies and solves your problem. 
 
 Change  
 
 to 
 
 Or run for testing next sql: 
 
 return 4 rows instead of 12.
