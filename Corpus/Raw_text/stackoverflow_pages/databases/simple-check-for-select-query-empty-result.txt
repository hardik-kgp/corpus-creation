*** simple-check-for-select-query-empty-result ***

 Can anyone point out how to check if a select query returns non empty result set? 
 For example I have next query: 
 
 Should I do something like next: 
 
 to test if result set is not empty? 
 
 Use @@ROWCOUNT: 
 
 According to  SQL Server Books Online : 
 
 Returns the number of rows affected by
  the last statement. If the number of
  rows is more than 2 billion, use
  ROWCOUNT_BIG. 
 
 
 
 
 I agree with Ed B. You should use EXISTS method but a more efficient way to do this is: 
 
 HTH 
 
 You can do it in a number of ways. 
 
 Or you can use   like  
 
 
 try: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 test if count == 0 . 
 More baroquely: 
 select case when (SELECT count(*) as count FROM service s WHERE s.service_id = ?) = 0 
   then 'No rows, bro!' else 'You got data!" end as stupid_message; 
 
 To summarize the below posts a bit: 
 If all you care about is if at least one matching row is in the DB then use   as it is the most efficient way of checking this: it will return true as soon as it finds at least one matching row whereas  , etc will find all matching rows. 
 If you actually need to use the data for processing or if the query has side effects, or if you need to know the actual total number of rows then checking the   or   is probably the best way on hand. 
 
 
 Then you can compare it as string like so: 
 
  is an object 
 
 In my sql use information function  
 
 it will return the no. of rows returned by select query. 
 
 well there is a way to do it a little more code but really effective
