*** simple-select-with-variable-but-without-into ***

 I have some different SELECT queries with same values. I want to use something like DECLARE but when I write a simple DECLARE it says that "INTO" is expected. 
 If I want only a "SELECT", how can I use this form witout "INTO"? 
 Simply I have two (or more) selects: 
 
 and  
 
 Now I want to declare a variable like var_col1 and var_col2 and use them in both select queries at the same time. 
 I thought this would work: 
 
 But no chance... How is the way to do that without a procedure or function? 
 
 When you write   in SQL*Plus,   is acting as the client program, and does a lot of work for you, under the covers, in terms of the data being returned from the database, formatting it and displaying it. 
 As soon as you type  , you begin a PL/SQL block.  Now, You're calling PL/SQL, and PL/SQL is calling SQL.  As a result, you need to decide how to handle the data being returned from the SQL, in PL/SQL.  The way to do that, is via an   clause and a variable to receive the output.  Considering that, where would the output data from the   go, if you don't provide an   clause?  It has to go somewhere, right? 
 Hope that's clear. 
 
 You have to select into your declared variables if you want to do it that way or set the columns.  For example: 
 
 OR 
 
 EDIT: I should also add that you can also declare output Vvariables that you can use in SQL to return output to help with debugging etc.  So you can do something like: 
 
 And in your BEGIN statement do something like: 
 
 Which outputs some potential useful info (depending what you set out to). 
 
 You're using PLSQL Developer, which has a choice of many different window types.  If I recall correctly, the Command window is the one which is a SQL*Plus emulator.  That being so this should work: 
 
 In other words, define two substitution variables, assign values to them and finally deploy them in all your queries.
