*** sitecore-moving-items-from-web-to-master-packages ***

 I'm running Sitecore 6.3. 
 I have a Sitecore Package which was originally wrongly created from the Web database instead of the Master database. 
 The database is long gone and I want to import this package into my new Sitecore instance, but run into the problem, that the Package gets directly into the Web database - whereas it is critical that it gets imported into the Master database instead. 
 I tried modifying the package manually by changing file names and references, but ran into problems when importing the package. 
 I discovered the Serialization feature of Sitecore 6.3, but it only allows me to de-serialize items which already exist, and in my case the Master database doesn't have the item. 
 What is the best way to move items from Web database back to Master? 
 Thanks 
 
 You can use the "Transfer Item to Another Database" feature, which you can find in the "Control Panel" -> "Database" menu. 
 Just login to the Sitecore desktop, switch to the web database and open the mentioned dialog. It will ask you for the source items/node and a destination... thatÂ´s it :) 
 
 Sitecore also have  **Transfer**
 function that can we access from item level itself. 
 You can access it from item> Right Click> Copying> Transfer
 
 
 I have posted a tool on Sitecore Marketplace which modifies the package. In other words, if you have a package created from web and want to install to master, you can use the tool to change the target database. 
 Moreover, it is better to use sitecore package than the transfer method. For more information, you may read my post on  https://hishaamn.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/sitecore-from-web-to-master/

 Please Select Web Database from Desktop Login. follow about step 
 item> Right Click> Copying> Transfer  
 then choose drop down web database 
 
 I've found that in Sitecore 8, Transfer (from the context menu and Control Panel > Database) fully moves the item from the source (web) to the target (master) database, ie when it is complete you will no longer have the item in your web database.  
 If you need to maintain the item in the source database consider making a  master  publishing target. Either connect to  web  and build the target there or create it in  master  and publish it to  web . Then connect to  web  and publish the item to  master . 
 Our master database is named "master", confirm your database name before doing this.
