*** slick-2-0-0-m3-table-definition-clarification-on-the-tag-attribute ***

 I'm working on migrating to slick 2 but I've come across a class that I can't seem to find anywhere.  
 
 The following is the code from the tutorial: 
 
 In the definition for Table it says that the Tag is of type Option[String] however in a tutorial I'm going through it just uses a type of Tag.  I'm looking for which package this is coming from.  
 
 Checking the definition of Table we can see that it's of type  :  Table definition  Don't know where you read or found that it's of type  . 
 Clicking on   brings up the Tag definition:  Tag definition 
 So to answer your question it's coming from the   package. 
 You won't be needing to actually create a  , because you query with the   construct, which takes care of all the   related stuff.
