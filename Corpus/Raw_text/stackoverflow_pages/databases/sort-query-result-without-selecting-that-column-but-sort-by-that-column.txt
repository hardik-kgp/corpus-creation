*** sort-query-result-without-selecting-that-column-but-sort-by-that-column ***

 I have a query, I have to sort the result from the DB2 database. The query will select the columns  . But I have to sort the result using order by empno 
But the query is not working.. This is the query.   
 
 Can you update the query to sort by   without using it in selecting columns? 
 
 Your syntax seems correct to me except dot(.) at the end. After removing dot if doesn't work... 
 Try something like 
 
 
 I'm not sure, but the fastest way on DB is something like this: 
 
 
 Another syntax that may be easier, depending on how you think about it is using the   keyword. This explicitly creates a named temporary table with the desired ordering, then queries from that. The order of the new query will be the same as the temporary tables ordering. 
 
 The answer by @jaychapani is more concise and functionally does the same thing, but the   syntax is powerful for quite a few other use cases and visually separates the two, which can be helpful especially if you have a long subquery that does other things. 
 
 try this 
 
 make sure that columns and table  name really exist. 
 have a look at:  ORDER BY clause
