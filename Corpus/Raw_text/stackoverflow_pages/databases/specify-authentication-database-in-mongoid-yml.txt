*** specify-authentication-database-in-mongoid-yml ***

 I'm trying to authenticate through mongoid.yml, but the user I want to authenticate as is in the admin database. If I try to specify the admin database in the database field, it will put all the collections in there too and I don't want that.  
 Is there a way to set my database field to a database I want, but specify a separate authentication database?
Heres my mongoid.yml file at the moment 
 
 
 The question is over a year old but it deserves an answer. 
 Yes, the  auth_source  option specifies the authentication database. You got to be on mongoid 5.0.0 or higher ( documentation on the mongodb website  ). Note mongoid defaults to the the admin database. 
 Can't find such an option for the  Mongoid 4 configuration . I created authentications on the actual databases (there could be a way I am not aware of). 
 Segment of mongoid.yml (5.0.0):
