*** specify-server-in-sql-script ***

 I am writing a sql script for sql server 2008 where I place a use statement at the beginning that specifies the database the script should be run against: 
 
 As I have different environments where the same database exists, eg dev, qa, prod, is there any way I can specify in the script the environment the script is for, either by server name or ip address or by any other mechanism. 
 
 You can put the SQL Management Studio in  SQLCMD mode  and specify the server with the   statement.   
 You can switch on command mode by clicking on the option in the pic below
 
 Your script would then look something like this 
 
 You can even make the query window switch servers during execution 
 
 To connect with a specific user and password you can specify this as follows 
 
 There are actually a number of options you can specify which are well  documented on msdn . 
 
 That's a  **CONNECTION**
 setting, not a parameter within the script. 
 You can run the same script in different environments via batch file or powershell script if desired, or you could set up linked servers, but you can't just say 
 
 There are security and networking implications as well. 
 
 Assuming you will run all of these scripts on a particular server - e.g. the Dev server - then you merely need to create a Linked Server to each of the other servers. 
 Then, for example, you could run an identically named stored procedure on each of these servers thusly: 
 
 etc.
