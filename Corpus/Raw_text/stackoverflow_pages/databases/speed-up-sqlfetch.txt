*** speed-up-sqlfetch ***

 I am working with an Oracle database and like to fetch a table with 30 million records.  
 
 For 1 million records the process needs 1074.58 sec. Thus, it takes quite a while for all 30 million records. Is there any possiblity to speed up the process?  
 I would appreciate any help. Thanks. 
 
 You could try making a system call through the R terminal
to a mySQL shell using the system() command. Process your data externally and only load what you need as output.
