*** spring-batch-framework-auto-create-batch-table ***

 I just created a batch job using Spring Batch framework, but I don't have Database privileges to run CREATE SQL. When I try to run the batch job I hit the error while the framework tried to create TABLE_BATCH_INSTANCE. I try to disable the  
 
 But after I tried I still hit the error  
 
 Anyway can disable the SQL, I just want to test my reader writer and processor work properly.  
 
 Spring Batch uses the database to save metadata for its recover/retry functionality. 
 If you can't create tables in the database then  you have to disable this behaviour   
 If you can create the batch metadata tables but not in runtime then you might  create them manually 
 
 With Spring Boot 2.0 you probably need this:
 https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.M7/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-initialize-a-spring-batch-database 
 
 By default it will only create the tables if you are using an embedded database. 
 Or 
 
 To permanently disable it.  
 
 To enable auto create spring batch data-schema simply add this line to your spring application.properties file : 
 spring.batch.initialize-schema=always 
 To understand more about Spring batch meta-data schema : 
 https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/trunk/reference/html/metaDataSchema.html 
 
 Seems silly, but someone can have the same problem. 
 I was receiving this error after drop all tables from a database. When I tried to start the Spring Batch, I received the error: 
 
 bad SQL grammar [SELECT JOB_INSTANCE_ID, JOB_NAME from BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE where JOB_NAME = ? and JOB_KEY = ?] 
 
 and: 
 
 Invalid object name 'BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE' 
 
 This happened to me because I  **drop the tables without restart the service**
. The service was started and receive the database metadata  **with**
 the Batch tables on the database. After drop them and not restart the server, the Spring Batch thought that the tables still exists. 
 After restart the Spring Batch server and execute the batch again, the tables were created without error. 
 
 When running with Spring Boot: 
 
 This should be enough: 
 
 The initialize-schema did not work for this Spring boot version.
After that I was able to copy the SQL scripts from the spring-core jar and change the table capitalization since this was my issue with the automatic table creation under Windows/Mac/Linux. 
 
  tag is parsed by Spring using  . You can try debugging this class in your IDE to make sure what values are being picked up for   attribute. Also this value can be disabled by using JVM parameter  
 
 
 And make sure you are using compatible  **spring-jdbc**
 -version with  **spring-batch**
.
Most probably  **spring-jdbc-3.2.2.RELEASE.JAR**
 compatible. 
 
 this works for me: Spring boot 2.0
