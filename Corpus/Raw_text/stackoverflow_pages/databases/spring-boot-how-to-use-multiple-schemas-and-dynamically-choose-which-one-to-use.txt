 I have the same question as below, but I want to know the answer. 
 Spring Boot: How to use multiple schemas and dynamically choose which one to use for every request at runtime 
 Please help me in finding answer for  
 How can I have one database connection and specify a different schema for every request? 
 Thank you in advance. 
 
 Wouldn't it work to have multiple data sources defined, and depending on your request, change to the one with the correct schema? 
 
 Otherwise you'd need to kill & re-create the connection to keep using the singular data source, but that would be really slow for your application since it would need reconnecting again and again. It would be better for you to use some NoSQL database to achieve this sorta dynamic data storage.
