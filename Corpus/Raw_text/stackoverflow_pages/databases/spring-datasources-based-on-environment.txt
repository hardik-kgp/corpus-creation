*** spring-datasources-based-on-environment ***

 I am trying to configure my Spring Boot application to use specific datasources when certain environmental variables exist. For example, if the   environmental variable exists, I would like to use my production datasource; otherwise, I would like to use my local datasource (of the same type). 
 I have found  something in the Spring reference  that explains how a single datasource could be declared in my  . Specifically, a MySQL datasource could look like: 
 
 However, I do not see how I could change the datasource properties conditionally in this file. Is there another way to do it? 
 
 In Spring Boot you can: 
 
 Externalize   from your jar and provide file per environment by adding path as a startup parameter: 
 
 Use Spring profiles. Create   for each profile, in each one different datasource properties 
 Use Spring profiles and instead of  , put your properties to   where you can put properties for all environments using convention as below: 
 
 Use environment variables and set  ,  ,  , and (optionally)  .
