 I am getting the following error when trying to run this query in sql 2005: 
 
 I am new to sql. Thank You in advance for your advise.

 The problem, as mentioned, is that you are selecting PEID from two tables, the solution is to specify which PEID do you want, for example 
 
 That aside, as Chris Lively cleverly points out in a comment the outer SELECT is totally superfluous. The following is totally equivalent to the first. 
 
 or even  
 
 but please  **avoid using SELECT * whenever possible**
. It may work while you are doing interactive queries to save typing, but in production code never use it. 
 
 Looks like you have the column  PEID  in both tables:  vDeriveAvailabilityFromPE  and  PE_PDP .  The   statement tries to select both, and gives an error about duplicate column name. 
 
 You're joining three tables, and looking at all columns in the output (*). 
 It looks like the tables have a common column name PEID, which you're going to have to alias as something else. 
 Solution: don't use * in the subquery, but explicitly select each column you wish to see, aliasing any column name that appears more than once. 
 
 Instead of using * to identify collecting all of the fields, rewrite your query to explicitly name the columns you want.  That way there will be no confusion. 
 
 just give new alias name for the column that repeats,it worked for me.....
