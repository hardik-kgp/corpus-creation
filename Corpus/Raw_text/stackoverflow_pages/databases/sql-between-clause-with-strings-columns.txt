*** sql-between-clause-with-strings-columns ***

 I want to make a search using "between" clause over a string column. Doing some test I got this: 
 Let's assume that there is a country table with a "name" column of type varchar. If I execute this query: 
 
 I got this result: 
 
 It excludes those countries that starts with B which I found a little bit weird. 
 Is there a way to do this search in a more accurate way? Any other ideas for make this search? 
 Thanks in advance 
 
 The expression 
 
 is equivalent to 
 
 So 'Argentina' is >='A' and <='B' and it satisfies the condition. But 'Bolivia' is NOT <='B'. 'Bolivia'>'B'. It doesn't just look at the first letter: it looks at the whole string. Which is surely the way it ought to be: if it didn't do this, there'd be no way to say that you wanted a range that included 'Smith' but not 'Smithers'. 
 To accomplish what you want, you could say: 
 
 or: 
 
 or: 
 
 
 i think i know how to solve your problem. u can try adding extra character in the back like this 
 
 this will return a result from ABC% to ACE 
 
 Another query that would get countries that start with b as well as A, would be: 
 
 
 The result's accurate, but you may be misunderstanding.   means  . (See the  PostGRES documentation  for details.) 
 If you want to get lines that start with either an   or a  , say what you mean: 
 
  uses the table indices so you'll get full performance for using this. 
 
 
 
 The reason this statement didn't work is SQL pads the string with whitespace until it's the same length as the comparing string. So, in comparison, sql compared   followed by several blanks with  . Because whitespace appears before all the other letters, sql decided   came after  . So it shouldn't be displayed.
