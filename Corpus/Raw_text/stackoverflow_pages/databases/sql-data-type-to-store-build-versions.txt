*** sql-data-type-to-store-build-versions ***

 What data type should i use for a SQL column to store Product version eg.  
 
 In query i should be able to sort them based on version number and i want an optimal query to find highest number. 
 Thanks 
 
 I would consider storing each part of the number in a separate TINYINT/SMALLINT field. 
 
 Perhaps have three or four numeric fields to the version table: 
 
 
 A good solution would be to use an integer building the value to store like so: 
 
 Assuming each one can range from 0..99.  If you want to go 0..999 use 
 
 This will sort properly, will query easily, is compact (1 int column), is easily decomposed and can even be decomposed visually. 
 
 Storing in separate numeric fields is a good idea. Storing as a string in a single field will break sorting when one of the parts reaches 1000. For example, 1.2.999 will appear before (or shown as newer than) 1.2.1000 when it should appear after.
