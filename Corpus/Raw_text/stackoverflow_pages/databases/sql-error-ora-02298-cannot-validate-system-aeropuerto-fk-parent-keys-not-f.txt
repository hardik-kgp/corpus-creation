*** sql-error-ora-02298-cannot-validate-system-aeropuerto-fk-parent-keys-not-f ***

 I'm getting the following error in on Oracle SQL Developer: 
 
 Why? 
 
 There are records in   that point to records that do not exist in  . 
 To find out which records of   have that kind of issue: 
 
 If the result set is not empty, you  **do**
 have orphanaged records. You'll need to add the missing   records in order to create the   foreign key,  **or**
 update all the erroneous   to null (if this is a nullable field, but you will lose the city information for those airport records). 
 
 remove primary key constraint from the  column in which you want to add the foreign key
