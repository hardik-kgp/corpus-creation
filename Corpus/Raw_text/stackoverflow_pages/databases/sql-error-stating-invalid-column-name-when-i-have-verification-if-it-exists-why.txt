*** sql-error-stating-invalid-column-name-when-i-have-verification-if-it-exists-why ***

 There is staging script, which creates new column DOCUMENT_DEFINITION_ID stages it with values of MESSAGE_TYPE_ID + 5 and then removes column MESSAGE_TYPE_ID. 
 First time everything run ok, but when I run script second time I'm getting this error: 
 
 Invalid column name 'MESSAGE_TYPE_ID'. 
 
 It makes no sense since, I have verification if that column exists. 
 
 Why? 
 
 Try this 
 
 It bypasses the delayed name resolution by wrapping the update in dynamic statement. 
 
 Delayed resolution of names only happens on tables that don't exist. You will need to drop and create the entire table.
