*** sql-for-opening-hours ***

 In my shops database I need to have the opening hours. Do you have an idea how i can implement this in my dB? 
 The opening hours are from Monday to Sunday, each day can have 2 opening windows (ex 09:00-12:00, 16:00-19:00) 
 
 build another table, call it  , add a foreign key to the   table primary key, a   field,  ,  .
The data should look something like this: 
 
 This will give you the opportunity to build any kind of schedules, with as many windows as you want, with how many exceptions you need. It's universal, limited only to the fact that it expects all weeks to be identical. No holidays considered, nor odd/even-week schedules that someone might use. 
 Edit: 
With Julien's question, about working hours of a night business, it has come to my attention that the previous solution is not the best bu far. You can't have a bar open at 20:00, close at 06:00, and compare if current time (02:45) is inside this interval, because it won't be. That's why, it would be most convenient to register not the closing time, but the total working time, in the convenient unit of measure (minutes for example). 
 
 
 What type of database are you using?  If it's mysql, put in a field of type "time".  Then you can pass it the times and do basic sql time manipulations on them.  This whole post assumes mysql. 
 If there is only one store and you know it will never grow, just make a table called times where you keep the times the store is open.  Then, if you want to see if the store is open just check the current time against one of the ranges in the database. 
 If there is more than one store, make a table called "times" and a table called "stores".    In the times table, columns can be "open" and "close" with an id called "store_id".  The stores table needs an id too.  Then, you can just say: 
 
 This will give you ALL the time ranges associated with the particular store.
