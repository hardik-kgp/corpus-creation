*** sql-how-to-backup-a-database-and-export-as-a-mdf-file-with-ms-sql-2008-r2 ***

 I have created a database "test" with some tables in MS SQL Server 2008 R2 (i.e. MS SQL Server Management Studio). 
 Now, I need to export this database as a MDF file. 
 What should I do? 
 
 If you mean that you want to be able to attach the database on another server, then this is what you can do: 
 
 detach the database (right click the database and click  ) 
 copy the mdf and ldf files to your backup location 
 attach the database (right click   and click  ) 
 
 **This is the path where you will find MDF file:**
  
 
 
 right-click on database from Management Studio -> Detach. Then you have the MDF file you can export to wherever you want :) 
 
 I think the best way is to create a   file from SQL Server .  
 Right click on the database =>   =>   -> Choose the database in   , and hit   .  
 
 If what you want is a replica of your SQLEXPRESS/MDF local file- on a remote server (SQL Server 2005) 
 You can right click in the  **"Server Explorer"**
 on your db.mdf file and press  **"Publish to provider..."**

 You can choose a variety of compatibilities with SQL Server 2005, 2008, etc. 
 The output is a  **.sql query file ..**

 Came across this question and thought this would be a good alternative answer, since I got here by searching for the exact same thing! 
 
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\ 
 **This is the path where you will find MDF file**
  
 
 Go to the path C:\Users\your pc name
then you will find mdf , ldf file here 
 
 If you are in Visual Studio, go to  **SQL Server Object Explorer**
. Find the database you want, right click and select properties. In the properties tab, look for  **Data File**
, next to it will be the location for your mdf file.  
 
 In my experience, its easier to use the commands sp_detach_db ( MSDN ) and sp_attach_db ( MSDN ). I was trying to attach a database that was offline when detached and SQL Server Management Studio (2014) kept crashing when I used the Attach option from the right-click context menu. The commands worked - hope this saves someone some time. 
 **NOTE:**
 Run SSMS as an administrator if you see an access denied while trying to execute the attach command
