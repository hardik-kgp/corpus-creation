 I need a query that will give me a result like this: 
 
 Note that the values in FieldName are not limited to Username, Password, and Email Address. They can be anything as they are user defined. 
 Is there a way to do this in SQL? 
 
 MySQL doesn't support ANSI PIVOT/UNPIVOT syntax, so that leave you to use: 
 
 As you can see, the CASE statements need to be defined per value.  To make this dynamic, you'd need to use  MySQL's Prepared Statement (dynamic SQL) syntax . 
 
 You could use  GROUP_CONCAT   
 (untested)
