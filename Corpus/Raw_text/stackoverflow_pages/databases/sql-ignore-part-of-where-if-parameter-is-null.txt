*** sql-ignore-part-of-where-if-parameter-is-null ***

 I have a stored procedure that fetches info from a table based on 4 parameters. 
 I want to get values based on the parameters, but if a parameter is NULL then that parameter isn't checked. So if all 4 parameters is null I would show the entire table. 
 This is my SP (as you can see, this only works for 1 parameter atm): 
 
 Is there some way to do this  without  having a   for every possible combination (15 IFs)? 
 
 How about something like 
 
 in this specific case you could have also used 
 
 But in general you can try something like

 If you mean @param1 is parameter for col1, @param2 is parameter for col2,... etc
You can try this: 
 
 
 You can use use   function in SQL server. You don't need to use   or   in your statements. Here is how you can use  function. 
 
 The   function in SQL returns the first non-NULL expression among its arguments. Here for example if the @param1 is equal to null the function will return col1 which will lead to col1=col1 in the where statement which is like 1=1 meaning the condition will always be true. 
 
 Add Condition in where and using  
 TRY TO FOLLOWING WAY. 
 
 ONCE YOU SET SAME COLUMN NAME INTO WHERE CONDITION THEN YOU RETRIEVE ALL DATA FROM TABLE ELSE IF YOU WANT TO PASS AS PARAMETER THEN RETRIEVE BASE ON CONDITION VALUES FROM TABLE.
