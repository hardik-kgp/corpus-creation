*** sql-join-three-tables ***

 I'm learning advanced SQL queries little by little and I'm fairly stumped with a problem: 
 I have three tables:  ,  , and  . Each field in the   table ( ) is a news story, which then has an associated author in the   table ( ) and can have any number of images associated in the   table. Each image has and associated ( ). So each story has one author but can have several images. 
 I want to make a list of all news stories and use  just one  of the images as a thumbnail image. The problem is that any sql query I try to list the   items with gives me results equal to the number of images in the   table rather than the number of   items. 
 I don't know where to go from here. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
 
 If the 3 tables in question are [ news ], [ author ] and [ image ] with appropriate columns, then  
 **Derived Table approach**

 you can have a derived image table to get one image per news and then join it with the  news  and  author  table as shown.
This has been written and tested in SQL Server. 
 
 You could replace the LEFT OUTER JOINs with INNER JOINs if you do not need news without any images. 
 **Correlated Subquery approach**
 (as suggested by Marcelo Cantos) 
 If the imageData is stored as a text or image, then the MAX in the derived table wouldn't work. In that case, you can use a correlated subquery like this: 
 
 
 
 One option is to add the following predicate: 
 
 Note that this excludes news items without an image. If you don't want this, you'll need a left join on images and an additional condition on the WHERE: 
 
 
 You can to modify the order by on the subselect to get the 1 image per news row you are looking for... 
 
 
 If you have 3 table in mysql and you want to join it together. for example I have 3 table 
1 student
2 subject
3 score
now want to join student with subject and score. so we you this syntax :
select * from student inner join subject inner join score;
