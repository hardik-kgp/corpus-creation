 I have a very strange behaviour that I cannot understand in my SQL DB (I am using MySQL 5.5.8): 
 I have in a table a varchar(10) a name: joe. 
 If a run a sql like this: 
 
 I get one result: joe but this is wrong since in the table I do not have any 'joe ' (with a space at the end. I only have 'joe' (no space) 
 However if I execute: 
 
 I get as I expect: nothing.
As far as I know = should be "exact" matching while like is more loose to be able to use it with sub strings and %. 
 What am I missing ? 
 
 Trailing spaces are not significant for   or   comparison using  . See  string comparison functions : 
 
 In particular, trailing spaces are significant, which is not true for CHAR or VARCHAR comparisons performed with the = operator: 
 
 
 
 I believe this is because of the data type you are using. 
 
 The CHAR and VARCHAR types are similar, but differ in the way they are
  stored and retrieved. As of MySQL 5.0.3, they also differ in maximum
  length and in whether trailing spaces are retained.
