*** sql-multi-valued-attributes ***

 I created a table that contains information about a company. One attribute is their telephone number. A company can have many telephone numbers.  
 How do I create multi-valued attributes in SQL? 
 
 In a separate table like: 
 
 How to use these structures: 
 
 
 There is generally no such thing as multi-valued attribute in relational databases.  
 Possible solutions for your problem: 
 
 Create a separate table for storing phone numbers which references your company table by primary key and contains undefinite number of rows per company. 
 For example, if you have table   with fields   then you can create a table   with fields  .  
 (NOT recommended in general, but if you only need to show a list of phones on website this might be an option) Storing telephones in a single field using varchar(...) or text and adding separators between numbers. 
 
 
 In addition to Oleg and Sergey's answers, a third option might be to create multiple phone fields on the company table - for example, as   and   for the main switchboard and the fax line, respectively. 
 This type of solution is generally regarded as a form of denormalisation, and is generally only suitable where there is a small number of multiple options, each with a clearly defined role. 
 So, for example, this is quite a common way to represent landline and mobile/cellphone numbers for a contact list table, but would be thoroughly unsuitable for a list of all phone extensions within a company. 
 
 There're some possibilities in different implementations of RDBMS. 
 For example, in  **PostgreSQL**
 you can use  array  or  hstore  or even  JSON (in 9.3 version) :

 You can also create indexes on these fields -  https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/45820/how-to-properly-index-hstore-tags-column-to-faster-search-for-keys ,  Can PostgreSQL index array columns? 
 In  **SQL Server**
, you can use xml datatype to store multivalues:

 You can also  create xml indexes  on xml type column.
