*** sql-on-delete-cascade-which-way-does-the-deletion-occur ***

 If I have two relations in a database, like this: 
 
 and I establish a foreign key relationship between the two, like this: 
 
 Then you can see that the   attribute in the   relation references the   attribute in the   relation. 
 My question is when a deletion occurs in either of the two relations, which way does the deletion cascade? If I delete a tuple in the   relation, will it delete all referencing tuples in the   relation, or is it the other way around? 
 
 Cascade will work when you delete something on table  . Any record on table   that has reference to table   will be deleted automatically. 
 But when you try to delete on table   only the table itself is affected and not on the  
 follow-up question: why do you have   on table Category? 
 Maybe you should restructure your schema into this, 
 
 
 Here is a simple example for others visting this old post, but is confused by the example in the question: 
 Delivery -> Package (One -> Many) 
 
 The entry with the foreign key Delivery_Id (Package) is deleted with the referenced entity in the FK relationship (Delivery). 
 So when a Delivery is deleted the Packages referencing it will also be deleted. If a Package is deleted nothing happens to any deliveries.
