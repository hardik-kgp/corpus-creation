*** sql-query-containing-2-databases ***

 In C# I want to execute a query that use 2 different databases (One is Access for local, and other is distant and is MySQL) 
 I'm able to do it in VBA Access, but how I can make the same thing in C# ?? 
 This is how I made it in Access: 
 Link my 2 differents table/databases in Table 
 In VBA:   
 
 How I can execute this SQL in C# ? (What object to use, etc... Example code if you can)   
 Thanks ! 
 
 There are two ways to do this.  One is to set up linked tables on Access and run a single query.  The other is to run both queries from c# and join them with linq. 
 The first way is better.  If you really have to do it with linq, here is some sample code: 
 
 See why I said linked tables is better? 
 
 You should be able to run the same SQL command from any app, really.  This is assuming: 
 
 You're connecting to Access from your C# app 
  is a local Access table 
  is a link table in Access 
 
 Given these, you might try the following: 
 
 You might want to check  connectionstrings.com  if you can't get the connection string right, and you may need to install some components (MDAC or ACE) for connections that use those providers. 
 
 Well it is not possible to run this such complex query with single statement. 
 Basically each query execution object initialized by particular database information,
so need two different object for each database  **first think**
. 
 Now 2 Object need with initialized with its own connection object. 
 Just fetch data by first object and insert it to another database by usin second connection object. 
 
 You need to keep following points in mind before trying this type of query 
 
 Both the databases are accessible from your code. 
 There is inter-connectivity between both the database. 
 Both the databases are available for the user that you are using to execute this query. 
 You need to specify the query in following format 
 
  instead of just  
 **EDIT**

 If you don't have inter-connectivity between databases you can follow following steps 
 
 Connect to Source database using one  . 
 Read the data from source database into a   or   using   query. 
 Connect to target database using a second  . 
 Insert all the records one by one using a loop to TARGET Database using standard   query
