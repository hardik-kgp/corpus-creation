*** sql-query-for-updating-database-if-value-is-not-null ***

 I am having a table which has about 17 fields. I need to perform frequent updates in this table. But the issue is  **each time I may be updating only a few fields**
. Whats the best way to write a query for updating in such a scenario? I am looking for an option in which the  value gets updated only if it is not null . 
 For example I have four fields in database Say A,B,C,D.
User updates the value of say D. All other values remains the same. So I want an update query which updates only the value of D keeping the others unaltered.
 SO if i put a,b and c as null and d with the value supplied by user I want to write an update query which only updates the value of d as a,b and c is null.
Is it something achievable?  
 I am using SQLite database. 
 Could someone please throw some light into it? 
 
 Without knowing your database it's tough to be specific.  In SQL Server the syntax would be something like ... 
 
 **EDIT**

 Since you specified SQLLite ...replace my   function with    or alternately look at the   function. 
 
 Posting a SQL Server solution with 2 tables for posterity. Query joins two tables and updates the values that are present. Otherwise original value is maintained. 
 tables = table1, table2 each having field1 and field2
