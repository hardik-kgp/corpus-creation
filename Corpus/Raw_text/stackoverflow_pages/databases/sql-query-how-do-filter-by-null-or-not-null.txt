*** sql-query-how-do-filter-by-null-or-not-null ***

 I want to filter a record.... 
 If statusid is null, filter the record (where statusId is not null) 
 If statusid is not null, filter the record where statusid is equal to the specified statusid. 
 How do I do this?  
 
 Just like you said 
 
 or 
 
 If your statusid is not null, then it will be selected just fine when you have an actual value, no need for any "if" logic if that is what you were thinking 
 
 if you want to select where it is null or a value, try 
 
 
 How about statusid = statusid.  Null is never equal to null. 
 
 
 and  
 
 
 set ansi_nulls off
go
select * from table t
inner join otherTable o on t.statusid = o.statusid
go
set ansi_nulls on
go 
 
 I think this could work: 
 
 
 Wherever you are trying to check NULL value of a column, you should use   IS NULL  and  IS NOT NULL You should not use  =NULL or ==NULL 
 **Example**
(NULL) 
 
 will return the rows with    value is  
 **Example**
(NOT NULL) 
 
 will return the rows with    value is

 The keyword  ,   and   are  .
