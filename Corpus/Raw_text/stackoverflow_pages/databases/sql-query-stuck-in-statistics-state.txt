*** sql-query-stuck-in-statistics-state ***

 I've been troubleshooting this complex query today, thinking it was a performance issue. It appears that the query is getting stuck into the 'Statistics' state. It is currently in that state for 1300 seconds. 
 I've checked the indexes for the tables involved -- I've optimized the table -- what could be causing this hang? 
 
 
 I ran into the same problem recently: MySQL started to choke (stuck in state 'statistics') on queries with a lot of tables joined together. I found a good  blog post  explaining why this happens and how to solve it. 
 Basically at least in MySQL 5.5, the default value for the configuration parameter  **optimizer_search_depth**
 is 62 which will cause the query optimizer to take exponentially more time as the number of tables in the query increases. After a certain point it will start to take days or even longer to finish the query.  
 However, if you set the  **optimizer_search_depth**
 to  **0**
 in your  **my.cnf**
, MySQL automatically chooses suitable depth, but limits it to 7 which is not yet too complex. 
 Apparently this issue has been  fixed  in MySQL 5.6 but I haven't tested it myself yet.  
 
 I had the same issue on a Centos server 4 cores and 180GB ram. A simple query was taking forever to run and stuck on statistics state just like what you have explained. I ran   on the tables it was querying and like 5 minutes later problem was solved. However, I never found out if it really solved the issue or not.  
 
 Just a suggestion.
