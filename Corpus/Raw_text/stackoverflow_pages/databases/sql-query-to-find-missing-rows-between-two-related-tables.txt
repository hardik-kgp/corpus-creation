*** sql-query-to-find-missing-rows-between-two-related-tables ***

 I have two tables: 
 **Table A**

 
 ID 
 ABC_ID 
 VAL 
 
 **Table B**

 
 ID 
 ABC_ID 
 VAL 
 
 These two tables are directly related to each other through the   column. 
 I want to find all the   column values in table A which are  not  present in table B for the same ABC_ID.  
 
 
 or 
 
 or 
 
 Please note that these queries do not require that ABC_ID be in table B at all.  I think that does what you want.
