 I want an SQL statement to get the row with a minimum value.  
 Consider this table: 
 
 How do I select the ids that have the minimum value in the   column, grouped by game?  Like the following: 
 
 
 Use: 
 
 
 This will work 
 
 
 This is another way of doing the same thing, which would allow you to do interesting things like select the top 5 winning games, etc.  
 
 You can now correctly get the actual row that was identified as the one with the lowest score and you can modify the ordering function to use multiple criteria, such as "Show me the earliest game which had the smallest score", etc.  
 
 As this is tagged with   only, the following is using ANSI SQL and a  window function : 
 
 
 Ken Clark's answer  didn't work in my case. It might not work in yours either. If not, try this: 
 
 
 
 
 This alternative approach uses SQL Server's   clause. This way, it 
 
 creates the distinct list of games, and 
 fetches and outputs the record with the lowest point number for that game. 
 
 The   clause can be imagined as a  , but with the advantage that you can  **use values of the main query as parameters in the subquery**
 (here: game). 
 
 
 
 
 Try:
