*** sql-query-where-date-today-minus-7-days ***

 I have a SQL table of hits to my website called ExternalHits. I track the URL as URLx and the date the page was accessed as Datex. I run this query every week to get the count of total hits from the week before, and every week I have to manually change the "between" dates. Is there some way I can change my query so that the "between" dates are something like TODAY AND TODAY-7? Ijust want to not have to manually change the dates every week.
