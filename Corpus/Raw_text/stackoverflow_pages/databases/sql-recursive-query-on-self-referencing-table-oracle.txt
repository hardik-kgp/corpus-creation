*** sql-recursive-query-on-self-referencing-table-oracle ***

 Lets assume I have this sample data: 
 
 I would like to select all records start from accountId = 1, so the expected result would be: 
 
 I am currently able to make the recursive select, but then I can't access the data from the parent reference, hence I can't return parent_name. The code I'm using is (adapted to the simplistic example): 
 
 What SQL should I be using to the mentioned above retrieval? 
 Additional key words for future seekers: SQL to select hierarchical data represented by parent keys in same table 
 
 Use: 
 
 
 What about using PRIOR, 
 so 
 
 or if you want to get the root name
 
 
 Using the new nested query syntax 
 
 
 Do you want to do this? 
 
 **Edit**

Another option based on OMG's one (but I think that will perform equally): 
 
 
 It's a little on the cumbersome side, but I believe this should work (without the extra join).  This assumes that you can choose a character that will never appear in the field in question, to act as a separator. 
 You can do it without nesting the select, but I find this a little cleaner that having four references to SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH.
