*** sql-select-entries-in-other-table-linked-by-foreign-keys ***

 I have redesigned my database structure to use PRIMARY and FOREIGN KEYs to link the entries in my 3 tables together, and I am having problems trying to write queries to select data in one table given data in a another table. Here is an example of my 3 CREATE TABLE statements: 
 
 Say for example, I want to select all the usernames of users who purchased anything greater than $30. All the usernames are stored in the players table, which is linked to the accounts table and that is linked to the purchases table. Is this this the best way to design this relational database? If so, how would I run queries similar to the above example?  
 I was able to get get all of a users purchase history given their username, but I did it with 2 sub-queries... Getting that data should be easier than that!
Here is the SELECT query I ran to get all of a players purchase data: 
 
 Also, when I try to make references to the other tables using something like 'players.username', I get an error saying that the column doesn't exist... 
 I appreciate any help! Thanks! 
 
 Your design is ok in my opinion. The relation between players and account is one-to-many and not one-to-one since this way, you can have two tuples referencing a single player. 
 I would write the query you need as: 
 
 As Sam suggested, I added DISTINCT to avoid repeating id and username in case a user have multiple purchases.
Note the id is here to avoid confusion among repeated usernames.
