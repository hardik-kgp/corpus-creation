*** sql-select-with-multiple-references-to-single-table ***

 I have a SQL DB that contains multiple relational tables.  There are some fields in the master table that reference another table multiple times.  For example, say I have a database of salesmen who are responsible of sales for multiple states.  My database has fields for State1, State2, and State3 all of which map back to a States table.  I can't figure out for the life of me how to write a query to return a record with all the enumerated states.  If I only needed one State field, I know I would do: 
 
 How can I expand this for all my State fields? 
 Thanks. 
 
 Returning a column from each of the unique joins to the states:  
 
 Returning 1 column of all the states from the 3 joins: 
 
 There is also column-queries... 
 
 
 You need to use table aliases in order to join multiple copies of the same table: 
 
 An INNER JOIN requires that data is present - if not, the entire record is excluded.  A LEFT JOIN is safer, like if the state1/2/3/etc allows NULLs...
