 What are the recommendations of software products for creating automated backups of SQL Server 2008 databases? 
 The backup should happen without taking the database offline/detatching. 
 
 I would recommend just creating a maintenance plan in SQL Server to handle the backups, it can be configured to backup to a specified location at specified times, without taking the databases offline, and will handle your incremental backup cleanup.

 If you are using  **SQL Server Express**
, you won't find a UI to run periodic backups. 
In this case you have to run a batch using Windows Scheduled Tasks or something similar.   
 Don't forget to use a user with enough privileges to access SQL Server. 
 **In the batch file**

 
 **In SQLExpressBackups.sql**

 
 
 I struggled with this for a while because it wasn't obvious how to work a regime that produced files with different names so that one run didn't over write the other.  In the end it created the following Windows batch file 
 
 where a_backup is my sqlserver login with backup privileges.  The corresponding sql is 
 
 The discovery of "FORFILES" command to purge older files was the key finding for me. 
 The transaction logs equivalents are 
 
 with sql file 
 
 I should note that the database files are on my D: drive, which is why I took the backups onto the C: drive. 
 The Daily backup is entered as a job in the Windows Task Scheduler to run daily at 4:00am.  The transaction log backup is set to run daily at 8:00am with a repeat every 4 hours finishing after 13 hours (causing it to run at 8am Midday, 4pm and 8pm every day)
