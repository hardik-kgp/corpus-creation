*** sql-server-compare-columns-in-two-tables ***

 I've recently done a migration from a really old version of some application to the current version and i faced some problems while migrating databases. 
 I need a query that could help me to compare columns in two tables. I mean not the data in rows, I need to compare the columns itself to figure out, what changes in table structure I've missed. 
 
 have a look at  Red Gate SQL Compare 
 Otherwise here is a start (for sql server) 
 
 you can have a look at the  
 
 tables if you want to go deeper.. 
 **[update]**
  
 Using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables 
 
 
 I’d really recommend you use third party comparison tool such as SQL Compare already mentioned above or  ApexSQL Diff  or basically any other tool on the market.  
 Even though these are commercial tools you can get a free trial and get the job done if you don’t really need to do this daily.  
 If you really need to use SQL for this you can try really simple query like this and then build on top of this. 
 
 
 This works for me (had the same problem and just compiled my solution) 
 
 just set values for @TableOne and @TableTwo and run the script ;) 
 
 Realy it is a big script. :) 
 Use red gate sql compare.  They offer you 14-day free trial  
 If you realy need script it can be a text and than you can compare both by using any text comparer.
