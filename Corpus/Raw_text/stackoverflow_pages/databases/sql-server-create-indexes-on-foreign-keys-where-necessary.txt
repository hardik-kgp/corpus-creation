*** sql-server-create-indexes-on-foreign-keys-where-necessary ***

 I have lots of tables with foreign keys and some have an index while others have not.
All foreign keys are named   with indexes named  . 
 Are there some good practices, given the column cardinality of the foreign key, to create (or not) indexes ?
Could this be scripted as T-SQL commands ?  
 
 It does not matter if they are created via a T-SQL Script or via the Designer.  Your question is a little ambiguous, so I am unsure if you are also asking if it is okay to index all of the foreign keys. However, if you are, indexes should be created on columns that are referenced frequently in queries and you can do the following to improve performance: 
 
 Run the database tuning wizard which will supply a summary of improvements and recommend indexes. 
 Index all of the foreign keys and run the execution plan (To see if queries are performing faster or slower).  
 
 To create an index via  : 
 
 To get a list of all Foreign keys:  
 
 To generate a script that applies indexes across all foreign keys you could do this:

 Great work everyone, very helpful.   
 Adding an enhancement that includes the table schema.  You can also exclude FK names if you prefer (I tend not to add indexes on small tables)
