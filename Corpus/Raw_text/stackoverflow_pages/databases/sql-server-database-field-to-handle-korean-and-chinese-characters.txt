*** sql-server-database-field-to-handle-korean-and-chinese-characters ***

 Is it possible to have a field in SQLServer that can store Chinese, Korean and European characters?  My Chinese characters just become ????? 
 The datatype is NVARCHAR as well. 
 
  is the proper type for this - it stores everything in a 2-byte Unicode. 
 What you need to pay attention to is when working with   fields in SQL Server Management Studio - you absolutely  **must**
 use the   prefix in that case! 
 If you use this: 
 
 then SSMS will  **temporarily convert**
 the string literal you specify into   (non-Unicode!) and thus you'll loose any Unicode-encoded characters. 
 However, if you use: 
 
 (note the  **N**
 prefix before the string literal!) then SSMS will handle everything as Unicode all the time, and your Chinese or Korean (or other) special characters should be preserved.
