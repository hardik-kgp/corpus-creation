*** sql-server-database-last-updated-date-time ***

 Is there any sql script to find out when the database in SQL server is last updated?  
 I want to know the last updated date time for the changes done on meta data of the database rather than actual data inside the table. 
Particularly when: 
 
 Any new table is created/dropped from Database.  
 Any new column is added/removed from table in the Database.  
 Any new views/Stored Procedures/Functions are added/altered inside the Database. 
 
 
 Look in sys.objects should be enough, try this query 
 
 
 This will return last modified date time + name of updated item + description what was updated (table, stored procedure, etc)
