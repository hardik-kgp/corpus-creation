 I've recently run into this message from my ASP.NET site I've deployed onto a remote server via RDP. 
 
 A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. ( **provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found.**
)  
 
 I've verified that the connnection string I'm using is valid, and I've made sure that remote connections are enabled in SSMS. From my research it appears that this is a name server issue,  but even using the IP in the connection string still gives me that same error. I'm totally dumbfounded here, does anyone know why I would be running into this? 
 Also, even weirder...  One of the pages that accesses the database is inline (no codebehind) and that ONE page works. (connects to the databases and gives me a table view of what I want). There's another inline page that does NOT work, however.
