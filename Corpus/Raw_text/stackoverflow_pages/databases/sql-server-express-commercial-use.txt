*** sql-server-express-commercial-use ***

 I'm developing a web site and i would like to use the SQL Server Express as my DB.
The Express edition is limited for 4GB per DB. 
 Is it legal to create & use several DB's for the use of a single web site? 
 
 What about trying to migrate  SQL Server Express 2008 R2  who allow 10GB per DB ? 
 
 I suggest you read the licence agreement and satisfy yourself about how the product can be used. Note that the actual limit in SQL Server Express 2008 R2 is  **10GB**
, not 4GB. 
 However, you should seriously consider whether Express is the right choice for this application. Splitting the data into four databases will still leave you restricted to only 1GB RAM. That's a significant scalability limitation for web site usage. 
 
 I don't see why not, based on Microsoft's feature and limitations page:  SQL Server Editions 
 The hard limitations, per that link, of the Express Edition, are: 
 
 SQL Server Express supports 1 physical
  processor, 1 GB memory, and 10 GB
  storage
