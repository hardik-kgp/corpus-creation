*** sql-server-get-data-for-only-the-past-year ***

 I am writing a query in which I have to get the data for only the last year. What is the best way to do this? 
 
 
 The following adds -1 years to the current date: 
 
 
 I found this page while looking for a solution that would help me select results from a prior calendar year. Most of the results shown above seems return items from the past 365 days, which didn't work for me. 
 At the same time, it did give me enough direction to solve my needs in the following code - which I'm posting here for any others who have the same need as mine and who may come across this page in searching for a solution. 
 
 Thanks to those above whose solutions helped me arrive at what I needed. 
 
 Well, I think something is missing here. User wants to get data from the last year and not from the last 365 days. There is a huge diference. In my opinion, data from the last year is every data from 2007 (if I am in 2008 now). So the right answer would be: 
 
 Then if you want to restrict this query, you can add some other filter, but always searching in the last year. 
 
 
 Look up dateadd in BOL 
 
 
 The most readable, IMO: 
 
 Which: 
 
 Gets now's datetime  GETDATE() = #8/27/2008 10:23am# 
 Converts to a string with format 101  CONVERT(varchar, #8/27/2008 10:23am#, 101) = '8/27/2007' 
 Converts to a datetime  CONVERT(datetime, '8/27/2007') = #8/27/2008 12:00AM# 
 Subtracts 1 year  DATEADD(yy, -1, #8/27/2008 12:00AM#) = #8/27/2007 12:00AM# 
 
 There's variants with DATEDIFF and DATEADD to get you midnight of today, but they tend to be rather obtuse (though slightly better on performance - not that you'd notice compared to the reads required to fetch the data). 
 
 GETDATE() returns current date  **and time**
. 
 If  last year  starts in midnight of current day last year (like in original example) you should use something like: 
 
 
 The other suggestions are good if you have "SQL only". 
 However I suggest, that -  **if possible**
 - you calculate the date in your program and insert it as string in the SQL query. 
 At least for for big tables (i.e. several million rows, maybe combined with joins) that will give you a considerable speed improvement as the optimizer can work with that much better. 
 
 argument for DATEADD function : 
 
 datepart  can be: yy, qq, mm, dy, dd, wk, dw, hh, mi, ss, ms 
 number  is an expression that can be resolved to an int that is added to a datepart of date 
 date  is an expression that can be resolved to a time, date, smalldatetime, datetime, datetime2, or datetimeoffset value. 
 
 
 
 I, like @D.E. White, came here for similar but different reasons than the original question.  The original question asks for the last 365 days.  @samjudson's answer provides that.  @D.E. White's answer returns results for the prior calendar year. 
 My query is a bit different in that it works for the  **prior year up to and including the current date:**

 
 For example, on Feb 17, 2017 this query returns results from 1/1/2016 to 2/17/2017 
 
 I had a similar problem but the previous coder only provided the date in mm-yyyy format. My solution is simple but might prove helpful to some (I also wanted to be sure beginning and ending spaces were eliminated):
