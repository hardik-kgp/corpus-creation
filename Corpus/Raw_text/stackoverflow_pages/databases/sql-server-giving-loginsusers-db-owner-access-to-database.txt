*** sql-server-giving-loginsusers-db-owner-access-to-database ***

 We have a test database and some test logins that we would like to give db_owner access to through a script. Usually we would have to go into logins and right click on the username and go to user mapping and select the database to associate it with and give it owner access and click  OK . 
 
 You need to do two things, both running in the context of the target database (i.e., execute   first): 
 
 Add that user as a login to the database:  
 Add that user to the role:  
 
 In general, if you have SQL Server Management Studio 2005 or higher, you can go into the UI for an operation, fill out the dialog box (in this case, assigning the user to the database & adding roles), and then click the "Script" button at the top. Instead of executing the command, it will write a script for the action to a new query window. 
 
 Use  sp_addrolemember 
 
 EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'MyUser' 
 
 
 Here is how to use   with an existing server login named  .

 I'd like to propose another solution which may help someone...
