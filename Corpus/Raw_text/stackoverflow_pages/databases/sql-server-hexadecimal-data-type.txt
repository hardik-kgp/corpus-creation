*** sql-server-hexadecimal-data-type ***

 I'm looking for a datatype in SQL Server that stores data as hexadecimal rather than int, but can't find anything similar. Surely there is a hexadecimal datatype? 
 
 Store it as an   and use the   function to convert it. 
 There's no native storage for hexadecimal in SQL Server. 
 EDIT: 
 You can also store hex data as  , but there is still a conversion required, and there are data integrity issues with that method as well.
