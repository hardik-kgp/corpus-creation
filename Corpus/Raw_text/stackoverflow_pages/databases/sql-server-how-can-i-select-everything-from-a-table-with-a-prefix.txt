*** sql-server-how-can-i-select-everything-from-a-table-with-a-prefix ***

 I have the following code in a very long stored procedure, where P equals the Products table: 
 
 Which would give me "ProductID" and so on. 
 I would like to select it with a prefix such as: 
 
 Which would give me "P_ProductID" and so on. 
 Is this possible to do? 
 
 Not unless you use dynamic SQL.  It is very uncommon to require such a thing though, are you sure you need it? 
 Working example 
 
 Output: 
 
 
 You can do it if you list all columns separately. 
 Column alias can't be done with wildcard.  
 If p.* is a very long list and the rest are only a few columns it may be better to rename 'the rest' and leave p.* as it is. 
 
 I believe 'AS' only applies to one column. I'm sure you can prepend 'P_' to the column header in your code.
