*** sql-server-identity-issue ***

 I have a query like below 
 
 After execution it returns null in my parameter. 
 I want to get the value of identity. How can I do that? 
 The main issue over here is "IMDECONP38" - the server name that I used. If I remove this I can get the value of identity in my parameter. 
 
 When you use "IMDECONP38" then you break SCOPE_IDENTITY because 
 
 the INSERT scope is now on the IMDECONP38 linked server 
 SCOPE_IDENTITY runs on the local server, not IMDECONP38 
 
 If on SQL Server 2005, try the  OUTPUT  clause but I'm not sure how it works for a linked server call 
 
 Edit: Prutswonder said it first: use a stored proc on the linked server 
 
 See  this old question  for a similar problem: You cannot retrieve a scoped variable like   from another server. Instead, you should use a stored procedure on the remote server to achieve this. 
 
 Use a stored procedure in the remote database. 
 
 
 For sql server 2012, to get the name of the identity column 
 
 If you have a Linked server you can use this: 
 
 
 
 
 Please check if there are any  **triggers**
 set for your table. This will cause a problem when you use   to get the last inserted identity field.
