*** sql-server-profiler-how-do-i-find-which-database-is-being-connected ***

 I've Googled this with no success.  I'm using SQL Server Profiler for SQL Server 2008 R2, and I've ensured that for the 'Events Selection' of the trace: 
 
 I'm reporting all columns for Security Audit > Audit Login + Audit Logout 
 I'm reporting all columns for Sessions > ExistingConnection 
 
 I then start the trace after I've loaded an .aspx page, but just before I carry out an action that calls a certain SQL stored procedure. 
 I can then see at the start of my trace that under the 'EventClass' column I have 'ExistingConnection', however the 'TextData' for these events doesn't seem to identify the database I'm connecting to - it's telling me the main database settings (e.g. set ansi_padding on).  I can also see that for certain events I can see the 'NTUserName', which gives me some clues.  What I want to find though is which database am I connecting to.  Who wants some points for telling the community?  :) 
 
 When you create a new trace with SQL Server Profiler, a dialog is displayed titled "Trace Properties". 
 In the lower-right-hand corner you should see a checkbox labeled "Show all columns.  Check it.  Now scroll the table to the left and you should see a checkbox labeled "Database Name".  Check that, and start the trace! 
 
 
 From Trace properties -> Events Selection tab, you can show the Database Column. By default it is not shown.
