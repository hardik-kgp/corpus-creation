*** sql-server-synchronizing-2-tables-on-2-different-databases ***

 I have 2 tables with same schema on 2 different databases on the same server with SQL Server 2008 R2.
One table gets updated with data more often. 
 Now there is a need to keep these 2 table in sync. This can happen as a nightly process.
What is the best methodology to achieve the sync. process ? 
 
 Using MERGE is your best bet.  You can control each of the conditions.  WHEN MATCHED THEN, WHEN UNMATCHED THEN etc.    
 MERGE - Technet  
 MERGE- MSDN (GOOD!) 
 **Example A: Transactional usage - Table Variables - NO**

 
 **Example B: Transactional usage - Physical Tables**

 
 **Example C: Transactional usage - Tempdb (local & global)**
  
 
 
 You probably can use sql server's tablediff.exe command line utility. It can do table-by-table, one-off compare between two tables and generate the sql automatically for you to sync the dest to the source. 
 There's also a GUI wrapper around it  http://code.google.com/p/sqltablediff/  which makes the job even easier.  It will generate the command line for you. 
 You can then create a scheduled task to run the command line, and then execute the generated sql scripts. 
 
 You can select from the different databases and use a cursor to loop the selected data. Within that cursor you can do some logic and update or delete from the target table.  
 Also SQL 2008 has a nice new MERGE statement which you can use to select/insert/update in one T-SQL query.

 For more complex processes i use the first option. For more straight forward sync tasks i use the second option.  
 As an extra option there is also Server Integration Services (SSIS):
