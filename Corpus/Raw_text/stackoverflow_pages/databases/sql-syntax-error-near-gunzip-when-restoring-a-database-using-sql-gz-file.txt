*** sql-syntax-error-near-gunzip-when-restoring-a-database-using-sql-gz-file ***

 I am trying to restore a mysql db using a .sql.gz file. I am using mySql console to run a command because file size is too large for phpMyAdmin. Command I am using is 
 
 where root is the user id. There is no password for root. bd is the database to which I am trying to import. mysql is running on my local machine (Windows 8). I have a wamp setup. 
 This is the error I am getting: 
 
 ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the
  manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right
  syntax to use near   at line 1. 
 
 
 If you type   and you get a SQL syntax error that complaints about gunzip,  **you are already logged into the mysql console**
. The mysql console is not a general purpose shell! 
 You are using Windows and I suspect you haven't installed gzip in your computer (it isn't a builtin utility). It's a classical Unix tool but you can find binaries for  Windows . Install it and run your original command with a couple of tweaks: 
 
 Make sure you're in Windows prompt ( ) 
 Redirect gunzip result  to stdout  rather than a file: 
 
 
 Alternatively, you can run the dump from within MySQL promt ( ) if you uncompress it first (you don't need specifically command-line gzip, most GUI archivers such as  7-Zip  support this format): 
 
 
 You need -c option (output to stdout) 
 
 
 While Kisoft´s answer is the correct one, I just wanted to point out that you don´t need the -c, it works just fine as it is.
this command will unzip the database dump and import it into the database at the same time.  
 
 
 Your answer is already here 
 phpMyAdmin: Can't import huge database file, any suggestions? 
 Under php.ini file, normally located in c:\xampp\php or wampp whatever you called 
 
 Changing value there will get you what you want.Good luck
Dont forget to restart , apache and mysql . 
 
 you do not need to gunzip
just:
zcat myfile.gz | mysql -uuser -ppassword mydatabase
it is faster this way 
 
 Try this following steps to restore db using .gz files: 
 
 This will uncompress the .gz file and will just store beed_2013-04-06.sql in the same location.
