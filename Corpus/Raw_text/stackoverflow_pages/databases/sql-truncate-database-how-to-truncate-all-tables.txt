*** sql-truncate-database-how-to-truncate-all-tables ***

 I use  SQL server 2008 R2. 
 Is there a SQL command to empty the database, instead of having to truncate all 20 my tables? 
 I just want to delete the data not the structure. 
 
 You can use the sp_MSforeachtable stored procedure like so: 
 
 Be warned that this will delete (by truncation) ALL data from all user tables. And in case you can't TRUNCATE due to foreign keys etc. you can run the same as a delete: 
 
 
 I use this script 
 
 
 The accepted answer doesn't quite work when you have foreign key relationships. In that case you have to drop the constraints and recreate them. Below is a stored proc for doing that based on the answer  here 
 
 
 Most of the solutions provided either don't use TRUNCATE, which is different from DELETE, or they don't deal with the issue of foreign key constraints. The solution provided by Chaitanya comes close, but it falls back to using DELETE, and it does it in a stored procedure, which seems to not fit a situation where you are nuking all data in a database.  
 So, below is my variation which does use TRUNCATE and does address the foreign key constraint problem. 
 
 
 execute this  
 
 After copy the printed result and paste it on Query field and Execute it. It will truncate all tables. 
 
 
 
 Taking a point from both Boycs Answer and mtmurdock's subsequent answer I have the following stored proc on all of my development or staging databases. I've added some switches to fit my own requirement if I need to add in statements to reseed the data for certain columns. 
 ( **Note:**
 I would have added this as a comment to Boycs brilliant answer but I haven't got enough reputation to do that yet. So please accept my apologies for adding this as an entirely new answer.) 
 
 And then once ready the execution is really simple: 
 
 
 No nonsense script this: 
 
 Truncate will still not work if you have foreign keys in tables.
This script will reset all identity columns as well. 
 
 You can also use this stored procedure if you only want to truncate all tables in a specific schema:
