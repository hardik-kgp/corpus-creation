*** sqlalchemy-exc-operationalerror-operationalerror-unable-to-open-database-file ***

 I am running a program from another person who are inconvenience ask for help from. The program is a website. Server end is written by python and flask (module,  http://flask.pocoo.org/ ). The program has been successfully run on the server. What I need to do is modify something on it. Since the production server is not allowed for test, I tested it in development server locally via flask. However, I could not run even the original program. Below is from python. 
 
 
 Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "index.wsgi", line 6, in 
      from app import app as application 
 
 
 In the config.py file 
 
 LOGFILE = '/tmp/ate.log'
      DEBUG = True
      TESTING = True
      THREADED = True
      DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:////tmp/ate.db'
      SECRET_KEY = os.urandom(24) 
 
 Hence, I created a folder called "tmp" under my user and an empty file called "ate.db". Then, ran it again. It said 
 
 IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/kevin/log/ate.log' 
 
 Then, I created the log folder and the log file. Run it, but nothing happened like 
 
 (venv)kevin@ubuntu:~/python/public_html$ python index.wsgi 
  (venv)kevin@ubuntu:~/python/public_html$ python index.wsgi 
  (venv)kevin@ubuntu:~/python/public_html$  
 
 If it is successful, the website should be available on  /. However, it did not work. Does anybody know why and how to solve it? The codes should be fine since it is now available online. The problem should be a local problem. Thank you so much for your help.  
 The code of where the program is stuck

 finally figured it out, had help tho 
 
 
 I had this issue with sqlite. The process trying to open the database file needs to have write access to the directory as it creates temporary/lock files. 
 The following structure worked for me to allow www-data to use the database. 
 
 
 My database URI started rocking after adding one dot in between  . Working on windows 7. I had directory and db-file created prior to calling this. 
 
 
 I think I've seen errors like this where file permissions were wrong for the .db file or its parent directory. You might make sure that the process trying to access the database can do so by appropriate use of    or  . 
 This is specifically about Django, but maybe still relevant:  https://serverfault.com/questions/57596/why-do-i-get-sqlite-error-unable-to-open-database-file 
 
 I just met this same problem and found that I make a stupid circular reference .  
 ./data_model.py 
 
 
 
 ./app.py 
 
 
 
 Then I removed the app.py/db and it works.
