*** sqlalchemy-primary-key-without-auto-increment ***

 I'm trying to establish a table with a layout approximately like the following: 
 
 All field values are provided through an external system, and new Widgets are discovered and some of the omitted trait values may change over time (very gradually) but the ext_id and w_code are guaranteed to be unique.  Given the nature of the values for ext_id it behaves ideally as a primary key. 
 However when I create a new record, specifying the ext_id value, the value is not used in storage. Instead the values in ext_id follow an auto-increment behavior.   
 
 How can I specify to SQLAlchemy that the ext_id field should be used as the primary key field without auto-increment?  
 Note: 
I could add an extra synthetic id column as the primary key and make ext_id be a unique column instead but this both complicates my code and adds a (minimal) extra bloat to the database and all I/O to it. I'm hoping to avoid that. 
 Issue originated from a larger project but I was able to create a smaller repro. 
 Testing with sqlite 
 
 Set   to disable creating a sequence or serial for the primary key.
