*** sqlite-auto-increment-not-working ***

 ok this isn't spamming and it's supposed to be simple I don't know why it's not working
this is my code: 
 
 what's wrong with this ? the log displays 0 for all records 
 
 The primary key for SQLite tables is called _id. It is auto incrementing, and you should not be trying to insert values into it. 
 
 
 What worked for me was renaming my create type from INT to INTEGER and it started working. 
 From this: 
 
 to this: 
 
 
 
gets the index of the column, which ID is 0 indexed column, Name is 1 etc 
 you want  
 
 
 You can see 
 http://alvinalexander.com/android/sqlite-autoincrement-serial-identity-primary-key 
 **Example**

CRETAE_TABLE 
 
 INSERT_DATA 
 
 ---OR--- 
 
 
 You want to tell it that the column is auto incrementing. 
 
 instead. 
 
 Because You didn't set it to auto increment. Primary key is not enough.
