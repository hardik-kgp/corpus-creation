*** sqlite-connection-not-appearing-in-entity-data-model-wizard ***

 What i did to get where i am:
I installed the assembly from  http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki  using the GAC and VS2012 options. 
 I can now make a connection to an existing SQLite datebase or make a connection and create a new SQLite database file. 
 This connection will appear in my server explorer and works fine.
I can look in this database from the explorer and change tables and so on. 
 However, when i try to add a new  ADO.NET Entity Data Model  this already made connection will not appear in the available data connections.
Even if i then proceed in making a new connection, the  System.Data.SQLite Database File  option is not even in the list of options. 
 I have tried installing the entity package with NuGet separately or together with the SQLite packages. I have tried not installing them or only the Entity model in combination with the previously mentioned assembly, but the option for SQLite just won't appear. 
 After having googled and overflowed this for a frustrating amount of time and having found only a handfull of people that display the same problem as me but with no solution that works for me i come to you for help. 
 After all my efforts, I suspect it comes down to my  App.config  file.
Mine looks as follows:

 I used vs2012 .NET 4.5, SQLite version 1.0.96.0, entity 6.1.3 
 I hope someone will be able to help me.
