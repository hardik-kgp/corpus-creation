*** sqlite-database-maximum-storage-capacity ***

 How many records in an SQLite database can we maximally store? Is there any limitation? If the data goes beyond this limitation what type of error does it give? Will the whole the system fail, or what else happens?  
 
 Based on  this  page: 
 
 Android does not impose any limitations beyond the standard SQLite
  concepts. We do recommend including an autoincrement value key field
  that can be used as a unique ID to quickly find a record. This is not
  required for private data, but if you implement a content provider,
  you must include a unique ID using the BaseColumns._ID constant. 
 
 The limit is tied to  SQLite limitation . As for what happened when we hit that limit, I guess android will raise  SQLiteFullException . 
 
 Its 140 terabytes Maximum .  **In more details**

 
 SQLite was originally designed with a policy of avoiding arbitrary
  limits. Of course, every program that runs on a machine with finite
  memory and disk space has limits of some kind. But in SQLite, those
  limits were not well defined. The policy was that if it would fit in
  memory and you could count it with a 32-bit integer, then it should
  work.
