*** sqlite-database-update-query-with-multiple-where-conditions-in-android ***

 I want to update my database table with multiple where conditions. I already did with single where condition  
 
 Now i want 2 where condition.  
 P.S :- No raw query 
 
 You can separate the different   conditions with  like this:  
 
 
 **THIS CAN ALSO BE DONE LIKE THIS**

 
 
 Try this simple query
db.update(TABLE_FF_CHECKLIST_DATA,contentValues, "FFCHECKLISTID = ? and TASK_ID_CHK = ?" , new String[] {"EHS" , "CTO914"}); 
 where "EHS" is value in column FFCHECKLISTID and CTO914 is value in TASK_ID_CHK. 
 
 The way I solved my need
