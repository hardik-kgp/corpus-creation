*** sqlite-get-name-of-attached-databases ***

 How do I get the name of the Attached databases in SQLite? 
 I've tried looking into: 
 
 but there doesn't seem to be any information there about the attached databases. 
 I attach the databases with the command:  
 
 It would be nice to be able to retrieve a list of the FileNames or DBNames attached. 
 I'm trying to verify if a database was correctly attached without knowing its schema beforehand. 
 
 Are you looking for this? 
 
 
 **PRAGMA database_list;**

  This pragma works like a query  **to return one row for each database
  attached to the current database connection.**
 The second column is the
  "main" for the main database file, "temp" for the database file used
  to store TEMP objects, or the name of the ATTACHed database for other
  database files. The third column is the name of the database file
  itself, or an empty string if the database is not associated with a
  file. 
 
 
 You can use   command.
