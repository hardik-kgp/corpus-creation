*** sqlite-how-do-you-join-tables-from-different-databases ***

 I have an application that uses a SQLite database and everything works the way it should. I'm now in the process of adding new functionalities that require a second SQLite database, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to join tables from the different databases. 
 If someone can help me out with this one, I'd really appreciate it! 
 Edit:   See  this question  for an example case you can adapt to your language when you attach databases as mentioned in the accepted answer. 
 
 If  ATTACH  is  activated  in your build of Sqlite (it should be in  most  builds), you can attach another database file to the current connection using the  ATTACH  keyword.  The  limit on the number of db's that can be attached  is a compile time setting( SQLITE_MAX_ATTACHED ), currently defaults to 10, but this too may vary by the build you have.  The global limit is 125. 
 
 You can see all connected databases with keyword 
 
 Then you should be able to do the following. 
 
 Note that "[t]he database names   and   are reserved for the primary database and database to hold temporary tables and other temporary data objects. Both of these database names exist for every database connection and should not be used for attachment". 
 
 Here is a C# example to complete this Question 
 
 
 Well, I don't have much experience with SQLite you have to access both databases in a single query. 
 You can have something like : 
 
 In databases like SQLServer you can access other databases in this hierarchical fashion, this should also work for SQLite. 
 I think you can initiate an instance of sqlite with more than 1 databases !
