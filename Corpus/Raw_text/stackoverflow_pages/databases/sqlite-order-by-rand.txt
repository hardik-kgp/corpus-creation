*** sqlite-order-by-rand ***

 In MySQL I can use the RAND() function, is there any alternative in SQLite 3? 
 
 using  random() :  
 
 
 **EDIT (by QOP):**
 Since the docs on  SQLite Autoincrement ed columns states that:  
 
 The normal ROWID selection algorithm described above  will generate
  monotonically increasing unique ROWIDs  as long as you never use the
  maximum ROWID value and you never delete the entry in the table with
  the largest ROWID.  **If you ever delete rows, then ROWIDs from
  previously deleted rows might be reused when creating new rows**
. 
 
 The above is only true if you don't have a   column (it will still work fine with   columns). Anyway, this should be more portable / reliable: 
 
 ,   and   are all aliases for the SQLite internal row id.

 **For a much better performance use this in SQLite:**

 
 This is also applicable to MySQL. This runs faster because  **SQL engines first load projected fields of rows to memory then sort them**
, here we just load and random sort the id field of rows, then we get X of them, and find the whole rows of these X ids which is by default indexed.
