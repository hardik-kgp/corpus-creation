*** sqlite-plugin-for-eclipse-debug-sqlite-database-on-android-device-live ***

 I want to debug database on android device. My application is very heavy and I do too much insertion queries and other stuff so running on emulator is hell slow so I am debugging it on Android phone. 
 But I could not debug database, like in Iphone you can see even insertion made into database. I want to see the current situation of database without rooting my phone and pulling it from my phone and then opening it into some 3rd party software. 
 Is there any way to debug Android database on mobile phones without rooting and pulling database out? 
 There is tool sqlite3 but the problem is that when you connect to shell it shows you ugly data and furthermore if database is not created running any query actually creates database in database folder so you would never knew that your database was not created by your logic. 
 I hope you understand what I am looking for. 
 
 There is information on how to connect eclipse to a sqlite database  here . Another alternative is using  this  Firefox add-on to manage your sqlite database. 
 
 I had the very same problem and after a search I found this one  SQLiteManager plugin for Eclipse  which is a plugin for eclipse allowing you to see and browse your data strait from SQLite DB 
 To use this it's easy, start you emulator, browse the emulator files in the DDMS view then
go to data > data > com.your.package > databases > your_database_name.db (note the db extension is mandatory) 
and a new tab will appear with your data!
It won't work on a real device (maybe on a rooted one?) 
 Hope it will work for you :) 
 
 I'm still looking into it myself but there is  MOTODEV Studio for Android , requires free registration. 
 
 See the next simple, single JAR file.
