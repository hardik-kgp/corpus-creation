*** sqlite-preventing-duplicate-rows ***

 
 I don't want to have user or location to be   because I can have multiple rows with user containing the same data, or multiple rows with location containing the same data. I just want to avoid having both user and location having some value, with that row repeating any number of times. 
 Ex: this is okay 
 
 but this is not okay: 
 
 because a row already exists in which user = 1 and location = 2. 
 How can I avoid duplicates? 
 
 Declare a unique constraint on (user, location).  
 
 
sqlite> insert into Permission (user, location) values (1, 2);
sqlite> insert into Permission (user, location) values (1, 2);
Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: Permission.user, Permission.location
 
 
 First option is creating a   on   and   columns which will avoid duplicates.  
 
 Else if you already have duplicate rows in table you need to delete the duplicate rows and create  
 To remove duplicate rows use this query
