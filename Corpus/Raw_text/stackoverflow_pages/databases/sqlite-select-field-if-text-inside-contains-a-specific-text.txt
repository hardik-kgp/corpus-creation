*** sqlite-select-field-if-text-inside-contains-a-specific-text ***

 I want to select field if the text inside contains a specific word in addition to the entire text, for example: 
 field value =  
 I want to select this field according to the text  
 Thanks! 
 
 
 You could also do LIKE "%Hel%" which would select a field containing the string "Hel" anywhere within it as opposed to "Hel%" which requires that the string starts with "Hel"
