*** sqlite3-unique-constraint-failed-error ***

 I am trying to create a database which allows users to create 'to do' lists and fill them with items to complete. However, when inserting data into the tables it gives me a UNIQUE constraint failed error and I don't know how to solve it. This is my code for creating the database and inserting data. 
 
 I have copied the errors I receive below: 
 
 Any help would be appreciated! 
 
 You have set list_id to be the primary key on the list table, which means that value must be unique for each record. Trying to insert multiple records with the same list_id table is therefore causing the error. 
 The issue is the same for the item table. 
 
 You get a   error when the data that you are inserting has an  entry which is already in the corresponding column  of the table that you are inserting into. 
 If you want SQL to  **IGNORE that error and continue adding other records**
 , then do this :  
 
 
 
 If you want to  **replace the values in the table**
 whenever the entry already exists , then do this: 
 
 
 This saves lot of processing on your part and quite useful.
