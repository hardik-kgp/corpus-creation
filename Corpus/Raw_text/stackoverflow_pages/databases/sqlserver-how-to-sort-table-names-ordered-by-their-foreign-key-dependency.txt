*** sqlserver-how-to-sort-table-names-ordered-by-their-foreign-key-dependency ***

 The following SQL separates tables according to their relationship. The problem is with the tables that sort under the 3000 series. Tables that are part of foreign keys and that use foreign keys. Anyone got some clever recursive CTE preferably or a stored procedure to do the necessary sorting?? Programs connectiong to the database are not considered a solution.  
 Edit: I posted the answer in the "answers" based on the first solution
Free "right answer" to be had for anyone reposting my own "right" answer! 
 
 
 My rendition with moderate tweaks: This one is SQL-2005+ and works on databases without the "rowguidcol": 
 
 
 Thank you for a working solution NXC. You put me on the right track to solve the problem using a recursive CTE. 
 
 For thoose wondering what this is useable for: I will use it to safely empty a database without violating any foreign key relations. (By truncating in descending order)
I will also be able to safely fill the tables with data from another database by filling the tables in ascending order. 
 
 You can use an iterative algorithm, which is probably less convoluted than a CTE.  Here's an example that sorts according to depth: 
 
 
 This causes problems with self-referencing tables. You'll need to manually exclude any foreign keys that point to self referencing tables.
