 I am getting this error don't know the reason 
  
and here is the website on which i am tryiing to upload my file  . 
 
 This happen because selinux avoid db connections from the httpd server to the remote db server. To solve it you need to access your server trough ssh or just open a console if you have pretencial acces and do the follow: 
 You must check in the SELinux if the port 80 is managed in. You can check it typing   for list and check: 
 
 If you need to add the required port, just type: 
 
 Type the command to ckeck once again: 
 
 . 
 
 Then you should notify SELinux you want to allow network connections from the httpd server to the db remote server, seting the boolean variables that set it: 
 
 Down the httpd service  
 
 
 Up the httpd service  
 
 Now your httpd service should be capable to get data from the db server. 
 I hope that can be usefull for the gang that search solve errors like this. 
 From Chile, best regards. 
 
 Go in .env file and change DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 to DB_HOST=localhost 
 
 Maybe you need to shut down your selinux
just like this
