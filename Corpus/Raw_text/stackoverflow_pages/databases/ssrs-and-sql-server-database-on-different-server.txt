*** ssrs-and-sql-server-database-on-different-server ***

 Is it possible to install SSRS and SQL Server database on separate servers, or should these two be installed on the same server? 
 Thanks 
 
 In order to have Reporting Services on your application server, you would have to use a SQL-Server license. You can install just the Reporting Services section of SQLServer, but it is still technically part of the SQL Server application and requires a license for use on that processor(s). 
 So yes, you can install it on another server.  
Yes, you can install only the advanced services, but that still counts as full server., so it requires a full license. 
 Yes, you can install an Express Edition (with advanced services) on another server for free.  
But... the express edition SSRS can't access a non-localhost database (technical limitations of express & web edition).  
You can try to circumvent that with linked-servers, but you need to duplicate every used stored procedure, view, table etc., so it's an impractical mess. 
 The answer to your question is thus:  **Technically, yes - but actually NO, not without another license**
. 
That extra-installation is gonna cost USD 1'000+ per month. 
 
 Yes, you can install SSRS and a SQL Server database on different servers. While the default installation tries to install both, you can select to install them separately.

 Considerations for Installing Reporting Services 
 Installing SQL Server Reporting Services 
 From MSDN article  Considerations for Installing Reporting Services : 
 
 Select Database Engine Services in the Feature Selection page to host
  the report server databases.  Reporting Services requires a local or
  remote instance of SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008 Database Engine
  to host the report server databases.  If you install an instance of the
  Database Engine concurrently with Reporting Services, you can
  eliminate a post-Setup task by installing the default configuration,
  which creates and configures the report server databases
  automatically. In addition to hosting the report server databases, SQL
  Server relational databases can also be a source of data for reports
  and models. 
 
 
 You could install SSRS in a new server, but to do so you would need a new license for this other server. 
 From Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Licensing Guide: 
 "The software components of a single SQL Server 2014 license cannot be separated for use in more than one OSE. If these components are running on a server other than the main database server, then an additional license is required for each additional OSE in which they are installed. For example, if the SQL Server DB is deployed in one OSE and SQL Server RS is deployed in another, both OSEs must be fully licensed for SQL Server 2014 accordingly."
