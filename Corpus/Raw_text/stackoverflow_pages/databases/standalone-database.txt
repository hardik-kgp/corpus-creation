*** standalone-database ***

 I'm currently designing a small application in .Net and in the past I've been using MSAccess as standalone database that I can ship with the program. 
But I was wondering if in this day and age there wasn't alternative solutions, as easy to integrate in a .Net app., as transparent for the user and maybe better performance with large amount of data? 
 
 Your options are:  
 
 Sqlite 
 Firebird 
 Sql Server CE -  depricated , latest version,  4.0 SP1  was released 8/31/2012 
 VistaDB  - commercial 
 ESE  - Which is hard to integrate with .Net  
 
 SQL CE and Firebird are a lot faster when you need multithreaded writes, sqlite is king for single threaded access, or multithreaded reads. VistaDb is 100% managed so you can ship it on embedded devices.  
 These DBs in general will give you better reliability and performance to access. I would strongly recommend against using any of these dbs over a network share.  
 
 SQLite! This is exactly what it was made for.

 Yes.  I would recommend  System.Data.SQLite , which is a ADO.NET wrapper around  SQLite , a popular embedded database written in C. 
 
 VistaDb  is another one 
 
 SQLite appears to match your needs -- see  here  for more. 
 
 There is always  SQL Server CE...  but I have found SQLite to be much easier to work with, especially with System.Data.Sqlite
