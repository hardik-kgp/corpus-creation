 There is a link to a excel spreadsheet of all the country and state information. 
 
 Wikipedia has the full list of both 2-letter and 3-letter country codes: 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1 
 With regards to having it in a local DB table, note that this list does occasionally change as nations are created, renamed or merged, so although it's not very frequent, you do need to keep it up-to-date, and also importantly, know what you're going to do with codes which become obsolete (ie if you've got cross-references to it from other tables, you can't just delete a record without making the cross-references invalid) 
 [EDIT] 
 You comment that you're looking for a  state list . 
 This phrase "state list" is confusing. Are you using the word "state" as its used in the US. Other countries would refer to those as provinces, regions, counties, cantons, or a range of other terms. 
 More importantly, very few countries have  codes  for their individual regions. 
 For example, the UK is broken into counties such as Yorkshire, Hampshire and Surrey, but there aren't any codes that map to these names. There are short abbreviated versions of some of the names (ie 'Hants'=='Hampshire'), but they're colloquial abbreviations; certainly not official.  There are also UK postcodes which do provide codes for areas, but these do not map to named counties. And other countries don't even have that. 
 
 This has annoyed me too.  My issue is I can never find states to match countries.  I created this for people to use.  Its in YAML format, I generated python and javascript versions.  I also generated an alternate array.
