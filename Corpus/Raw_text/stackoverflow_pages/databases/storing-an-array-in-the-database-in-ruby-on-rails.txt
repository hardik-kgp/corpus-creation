*** storing-an-array-in-the-database-in-ruby-on-rails ***

 I have somewhat of a unique situation, if I had a form with a checkbox for every state (as in US states, so 50 states say), I don't really want to add 50 columns to my db, how can I store them in an array in a single column? 
 I feel like I've seen this done but I'm having a hard time putting my finger on the implementation. 
 
 ActiveRecord::Base.serialize . Straight from the rails docs: 
 
 
 You could set up a States table with many to many relationship between User and State also. This would make queries more efficient.
