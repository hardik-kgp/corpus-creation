*** storing-json-data-in-mysql ***

 I have an organization table for example 
 
 Now I want to add multiple addresses, phones and emails. 
 Is it a good way to store json data in email column like this 
 
 Or create another table just for emails and another for phones etc... 
 If storing json data is better - what is the best way to use it in rails? 
 
 Here is what I found 
 http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html 
 
 Saving arrays, hashes, and other non-mappable objects in text columns 
 
 
 Storing data as a JSON string in a single database field means that you will not be able to manipulate/query the data using SQL - which kind of defeats the point of storing the data in a database, you may as well store it in a text file. 
 I'd recommend a  one-to-many  relationship between your organization table and tables for email addresses and phone numbers. See  video explaining different relationship types 
 
 suggest you store those information in a single table.
according to your requirement.it seems use a good polymorphic model will be better. 
 The code may like this. 
 
 how to use 
 
 these codes not tested. but its my basic idea.
