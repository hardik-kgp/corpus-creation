*** storing-large-amount-of-images-in-android ***

 I am in the planning stage of making a database application for android phones. One of my requirements is that I be able able to provide offline access for users. I am wondering what would be the most efficient way of storing a large amount of images (around four hundred-several thousand). 
 Oh, the images have been pre-compressed/optimized for mobile viewing. The 50mb limit on apk for the market won't be a issue. 
 
 You have to develop simple logic.Suppose you have connection then download all images.Now you have two way to access these images while you do not have connection----- 
 
 Second.. 
 
 
 I would suggest storing the image files in sdcard and filename/path in sqlite DB. Store files in   directory. When the user deletes the application, the cache folder will be deleted and also all the stored images. 
 Application build file(apk) size will be less as tofeeqahmad was suggesting.
