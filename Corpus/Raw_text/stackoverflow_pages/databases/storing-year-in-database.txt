*** storing-year-in-database ***

 What is the best PostgreSQL data type for year data, e.g., 2006 or 1847. 
 ,  ,  ? Ideally, I'd like to be able to query that column with a second year-month-day column (in   format).  
 
 A year is an integer and even supports integer arithmetic in a meaningful way so   makes no sense. You don't have a month or day so   is right out the window. The  fine manual  has this to say about  : 
 
 The   type is generally only used if disk space is at a premium. 
 
 That leaves   as a natural choice. If you're planning to combine this value with  s and  , then   might make sense as the  date and time functions and operators  have a good understanding of  s. 
 So it depends on what you're planning on doing with this "year" and what it really is. Sounds like a simple   is appropriate but you might have to muck around a bit to combine it with your "second year-month-day column" (a   column presumably) depending on how they need to work together.
