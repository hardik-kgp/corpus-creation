*** strange-postgresql-value-too-long-for-type-character-varying500 ***

 I have a Postgres schema which looks like: 
 
 The problem is that whenever I save text longer than 500 characters in the description column I get the error: 
 
 In the documentation for Postgres it says type text can have unlimited characters. 
 I'm using postgresql-9.1. 
 This table has been generated using Django 1.4 and the field type in the model is TextField, if that helps explain the problem further. 
 Any ideas as why this is happening and what I can do to fix it? 
 
 By specifying the column as    you've set an explicit 500 character limit. You might not have done this yourself explicitly, but Django has done it for you somewhere. Telling you where is hard when you haven't shown your model, the full error text, or the query that produced the error. 
 If you don't want one, use an unqualified  , or use the   type. 
  and   are limited in length only by the system limits on column size - about 1GB - and by your memory. However, adding a length-qualifier to   sets a smaller limit manually. All of the following are largely equivalent: 
 
 The only differences are in how database metadata is reported and which SQLSTATE is raised when the constraint is violated. 
 The length constraint is not generally obeyed in prepared statement parameters, function calls, etc, as shown: 
 
 and in explicit casts it result in truncation: 
 
 so I think you  are  using a   column, and you're looking at the wrong table or wrong instance of the database. 
 
 Character varying is different than text.  Try running  
 
 That will change the column type to text, which is limited to some very large amount of data (you would probably never actually hit it.) 
 
 We had this same issue. We solved it adding 'length' to entity attribute definition:
