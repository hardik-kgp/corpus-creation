 i have a problem with my postgreSQL setup on my new Mac OSX Lion machine. 
 I can't seem to connect to the service 
 
 I have no chance to find the correct password. Any idea what could that be. I have the default setup with a localhost server. The same happens when I try to connect via pgAdmin.  
 
 I have no chance to find out what's wrong? 
 
 try this: 
 
 And specify your own password. 
 
 Does this work? 
 First get root access
