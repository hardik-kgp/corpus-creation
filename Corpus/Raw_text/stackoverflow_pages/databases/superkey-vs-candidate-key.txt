*** superkey-vs-candidate-key ***

 What difference between Super and Candidate key in ERDB? 
 Thanks. 
 
 A superkey is a set of columns that uniquely identifies a row.  A Candidate key would be a MINIMAL set of columns that uniquely identifies a row.  So essentially a Superkey is a Candidate key with extra unnecessary columns in it. 
 
 candidate key is a  **minimal**
 superkey  
 
 
 Candidate key = minimal key to identify a row 
 Super key = at least as wide as a candidate key 
 
 For me, a super key would generally introduce ambiguities over a candidate key 
 
 **Let's keep it simple**

 **SuperKey**
 - A set of keys that uniquely defines a  .So out of all the attributes if even any single one is   then all the subsets having that unique attribute falls under  . 
 **Candidate Key**
 - A   out of which no further subset can be derived which can identify the  , Or we can simply say that it is the  . 
 
 In nutshell:  **CANDIDATE KEY is a minimal SUPER KEY.**

 Where Super key is the combination of columns(or attributes) that uniquely identify any record(or tuple) in a relation(table) in RDBMS. 
 
 For instance, consider the following dependencies in a table having columns A, B, C and D
 (Giving this table just for a quick example so not covering all dependencies that R could have).   
 **Attribute set (Determinant)**
---Can Identify---> **(Dependent)**

 A-----> AD 
 B-----> ABCD 
 C-----> CD 
 AC----->ACD 
 AB----->ABCD 
 ABC----->ABCD 
 BCD----->ABCD 
 
 Now, B, AB, ABC, BCD identifies all columns so those four qualify for the super key. 
 But,  **B⊂AB; B⊂ABC; B⊂BCD**
 hence AB, ABC, and BCD disqualified for CANDIDATE KEY as their subsets could identify the relation, so they aren't minimal and hence only B is the candidate key, not the others.
