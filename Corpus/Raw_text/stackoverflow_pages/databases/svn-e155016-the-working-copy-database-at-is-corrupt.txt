*** svn-e155016-the-working-copy-database-at-is-corrupt ***

 My computer exploded while in the middle of an svn (version 1.8.8) update command. Now svn does nothing just tells me the working copy is corrupt.  
 svn: E155016 The working copy database at [dir] is corrupt 
 I have no idea what to do, any suggestions? 
 
 I solved the issue with a cleanup + revert + update (in that order) 
 
 **Cleanup**

 Try   in your working copy 
 http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.ref.svn.c.cleanup.html 
 **New  checkout**

 Try to make a new checkout to different place. If new checkout works properly, delete the corrupted one and replace it with new checkout. 
 
 When I removed the complete folder, repeated the checkout I got the same error.... 
So it seems consistent! 
 However,I was checking out into .  (currentDir) 
 When I then checkout out into another directory it worked fine!?!?! 
So much for transparent misbehaviours..... 
 **Environment**
