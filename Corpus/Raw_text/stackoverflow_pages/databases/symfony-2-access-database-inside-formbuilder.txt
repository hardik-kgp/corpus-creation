*** symfony-2-access-database-inside-formbuilder ***

 I'm building a form which contains a field named 'category', I need a choice list to do that, but I don't find out how to fill this choice list with the several categories stored in the database. 
 
 How can I get the categories from the database here and use them to build my form ? (can't seem to access $this->getDoctrine->... inside this class). 
 
 Use type   instead of  
 
 **Edit:**

 Two ways for using custom parameters in your query. In both situations, the parameters are injected from outside, so your FormType don't need any references to the session or request objects or whatever. 
 1- Pass required parameters to your constructor 
 
 in your   you must copy the value to local variable and make it available for the query_builder callback: 
 
 2- use the   parameter of the   method. 
 First you have to define a default value by overriding  : 
 
 Then you can pass it from your controller in the third argument of the   method. 
 
 Now the value should be available through the   parameter of youru buildForm method. Pass it to the callback as described above. 
 
 **In Symfony 2.1**

 You now have to use the  **OptionsResolverInterface**
 within the  **setDefaultOptions**
 method. Here is the code you would have to use if you wanted to retrieve the options (using the same example as the accepted answer) 
 
 
 You still pass the options in the same way:
