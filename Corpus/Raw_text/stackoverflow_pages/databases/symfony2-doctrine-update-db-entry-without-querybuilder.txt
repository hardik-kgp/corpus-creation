*** symfony2-doctrine-update-db-entry-without-querybuilder ***

 To save entry to db we can use: 
 
 But how can we update existing entry without using   ?  
 Can we?  
 I'm searching some kind of   for existing entry in db. 
 
 Simple way to do,  **Fusselchen**
 said right, just show an example 
 
 
 No, it doesn't exist a function like  . 
You have to fetch object from DB and update it or, simply, write a custom query (with DQL) that update what you need 
 As you can see  here 
 
 This is an example of DQL query for updating an entity named User 
 Last but not least important, this query have to be placed into aspecial "class" called repository that will contain all custom sql (dql).
This is a good practice.

 Get the Entity from DB 
 Change the values you want to modify 
 flush the entitymanager 
 
 no extra call for updating the database. The EntityManager keeps your model an Database in sync on flush()
