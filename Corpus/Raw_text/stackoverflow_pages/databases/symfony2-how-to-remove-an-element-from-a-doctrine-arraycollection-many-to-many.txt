*** symfony2-how-to-remove-an-element-from-a-doctrine-arraycollection-many-to-many ***

 I use the following code for my many-to-many relation in symfony2 (doctrine) 
 Entity: 
 
 Controller: 
 
 Now, how can I use this to remove a relation? Do I need to add a method to my entity like removeSyncSchema()? What would that look like? 
 
 You're looking for the   method here. 
 
 **tip:**

 You can use   to add elements to an existing collection. OOP. 
 In some cases you may also want to check wether already contains the element before adding it.
