*** system-componentmodel-dataannotations-dll-available-for-android-and-ios ***

 I got the the attached error message when tried to compile VelocityDB for android. As VelocityDB support said it really needs the data annotations. 
 Is the referred 'System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.dll' available for Android and iOS? 
 Thanks Jozsef

 Xamarin.iOS 6.4.x (stable), like the 6.3.x betas, is based on Mono 3.0 and ships with  .  
 The same is true for the latest versions of Xamarin.Android. 
 
 Xamarin does not ship   at the moment (September 2012). 
 We'll soon rebase the products on Mono 2.12 which has much better support for .NET 4[.5] and that will make us able to ship more assemblies in the future (but I can't say  **if**
 or  **when**
   will be available). 
 However Mono is an open source project. The source code for   is available on github so you can try, today, to build this assembly against the BCL that MonoTouch (or Mono for Android) ships. If you do then please share your finding with us! 
 
 I was trying to add System.ComponentModel from within VS 2012. I still do not have that dll available under Assemblies/Framework from with VS. 
 What I ended up doing was opening the project in Xamarin Studio on my MBP. I then was able to add the reference. I closed XS on the MBP and reopened the project in VS on my virtual machine and the reference was there. The solution compiled fine and ran in the simulator. 
 
 No, they are not currently available.  Someone from Xamarin might be able to comment on their future inclusion in either product. 
 
 Opened this bug on Xamarin that should be tracking this issue
