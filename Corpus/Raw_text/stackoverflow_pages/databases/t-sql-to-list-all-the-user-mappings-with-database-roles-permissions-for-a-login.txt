*** t-sql-to-list-all-the-user-mappings-with-database-roles-permissions-for-a-login ***

 I am looking for a t-sql script which can list the databases and and the respective roles/privileges mapped for a particular user. Using SQL Server 2008 R2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 I wrote a little query to find permission of a user on a specific database. 
 
 **The permissions of fixed database roles do not appear in sys.database_permissions. Therefore, database principals may have additional permissions not listed here.**

 I does not prefer  
 
 Because it's just retrieving which permissions the user has not where they come from! 
 Maybe i find out how to join the fixed database roles permission granted for the user one day... 
 Pls enjoy Life and hate the Users :D 
 
 Stole this from  here . I found it very useful! 
 
 
 using  fn_my_permissions   
 
 
 Is this the kind of thing you want?
  You might want to extend it to get more info out of the sys tables. 
 
use master

DECLARE @name VARCHAR(50) -- database name 

DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR FOR 
select name from sys.databases

OPEN db_cursor  
FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name  

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
BEGIN  
       print @name
      exec('USE ' +  @name + '; select rp.name, mp.name from sys.database_role_members drm
            join sys.database_principals rp on (drm.role_principal_id = rp.principal_id)
            join sys.database_principals mp on (drm.member_principal_id = mp.principal_id)')
       FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name  
END  

CLOSE db_cursor  
DEALLOCATE db_cursor
 
 
 Did you sort this? I just found this code here:

 I think I'll need to do a bit of tweaking, but essentially this has sorted it for me! 
 I hope it does for you too!
