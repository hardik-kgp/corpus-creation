*** table-details-in-sql-anywhere ***

 I just downloaded the developer edition of SQL Anywhere. How can I get a list of tables in the database I'm connected to?. Also for a particular table, how do I get the meta-data for that table (column names, types, etc)? 
 
 I have not used SQL-Anywhere for many years however the following statement should work 
 
 This was cribbed directly from  an earlier question 
 
 
 
 For a particular table: 
 
 will return the table's columns, with an indication of the column's type, whether it's nullable and a primary key 
 
 Assuming Windows: start - All Programs - SQL Anywhere 11 - Sybase Central 
 Then Connections - Connect with SQL Anywhere 11... 
 Select "ODBC Data Source name" and pick "SQL Anywhere 11 Demo" 
 Press OK to see a tree view of the various objects in the database (tables etcetera). 
 
 
 This will yield a list of tables and users that have access to them.  
 
 Use this view:  http://dcx.sybase.com/1001/en/dbrfen10/rf-syvcol.html 
 Try 
 
 or just tables which you created: 
 
 
 System proc,  sa_describe_query  is quite useful 
   
 
 To get the list of all tables used in the database : 
 
 To get the list of all columns : 
 
 
 select t.table_name, c.column_name, c.base_type_str, c.nulls from systabcol c key join systab t on t.table_id = c.table_id

 To select one table details  
 
 To select two different table and Map with id  
 
 
 select * from user_tables; 
 desc tablename;
