 When i perform any procedure creation or update operation to mysql DB, i am getting the below error 
 Table './mysql/proc' is marked as crashed and should be repaired 
 Tried to run mysql isam recover using below command -

 But the issue still persists. 
 Thanks in Advance. 
 
 Try these: 
 
 Inside MySQL terminal

Modify the my.cnf

 The above answer also applicable to other business related tables -  
 example -
 Table './dev/bank_accounts' is marked as crashed and should be repaired 
 Can be resolved by following command in mysql prompt. 
 
 Internally, mysql trys to recover the data from MyISAM storage engine of mysql. 
 Caution - Please take a back up of the table before doing a repair, As the repair might cause a data loss.
