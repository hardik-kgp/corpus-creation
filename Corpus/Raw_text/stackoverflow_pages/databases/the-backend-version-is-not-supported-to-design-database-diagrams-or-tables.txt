*** the-backend-version-is-not-supported-to-design-database-diagrams-or-tables ***

 I'm trying to add a table to my newly created database through SQL Server Management Studio.
However I get the error: 
 
 the backend version is not supported to design database diagrams or tables 
 
 To see my currently installed versions I clicked about in SSMS and this is what came up: 
 
 What's wrong here? 
 
 This is commonly reported as an error due to using the wrong version of SSMS(Sql Server Management Studio). Use the version designed for your database version. You can use the command   to check which version of sql server you are actually using. This version is reported in a way that is easier to interpret than that shown in the Help About in SSMS. 
 
 Using a newer version of SSMS than your database is generally error-free, i.e. backward compatible. 
 
 I ran into this problem when SQL Server 2014 standard was installed on a server where SQL Server Express was also installed.  I had opened SSMS from a desktop shortcut, not realizing right away that it was SSMS for SQL Server Express, not for 2014. SSMS for Express returned the error, but SQL Server 2014 did not.   
 
 I was having the same problem, although I solved out by creating the table using a script query instead of doing it graphically. See the snipped below: 
 
 
 You only get that message if you try to use Designer or diagrams. If you use t-SQL it works fine: 
 
 where   has been created in 2008 exactly as you want the table to be in 2012
