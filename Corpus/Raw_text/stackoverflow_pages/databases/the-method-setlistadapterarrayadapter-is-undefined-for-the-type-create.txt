*** the-method-setlistadapterarrayadapter-is-undefined-for-the-type-create ***

 I  am completely new  to  java & android, so  I tried to find useful samples from android & databases.  I found this blog with a project: 
 http://saigeethamn.blogspot.com/2009/10/android-developer-tutorial-part-12.html 
 I ran the project and it works fine,  but I  was trying to create a new project to copy & paste the code in it  and  this is not working  :(  
 I had a problem on this line:  
 
 This is the error I get: 
 
 The method setListAdapter(ArrayAdapter) is undefined for the type create 
 
 It looks like a method in C#, but I can find it in the original  project. 
 Where did I make a mistake? 
 
 When you call   this must extend   probably you class just extends  . 
 
 this code work for me..
