*** the-network-path-was-not-found ***

 I'm running my code and getting this error. But what does it mean? 
 
 The network path was not found  Description: An unhandled exception
  occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please
  review the stack trace for more information about the error and where
  it originated in the code. 
 Exception Details:   The network path was not found 
 
 **Source Error:**

 
 An unhandled exception was generated during the execution of the
  current web request. Information regarding the origin and location of
  the exception can be identified using the exception stack trace below. 
 
 **Stack Trace:**

 
 
 [Win32Exception (0x80004005): The network path was not found] 
 [SqlException (0x80131904): A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The
    server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance
    name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote
    connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not
    open a connection to SQL Server)] 
 
 
 
 This is probably related to your database  **connection string**
 or something like that. 
 I just solved this exception right now. What was happening is that I was using a  connection string  intended to be used when debugging in a different machine (the server). 
 I commented the wrong  connection string  in   and uncommented the right one. Now I'm back in business... this is something I forget to look at after sometime not working in a given solution. ;) 
 
 You will also get this exact error if attempting to access your remote/prod db from localhost and you've forgotten that this particular hosting company requires VPN logon in order to access the db (do i feel silly). 
 
 There may be some reasons like: 
 
 Wrong SQL connection string. 
 SQL Server in services is not running.  
 Distributed Transaction Coordinator service is not running.  
 
 First try to connect from SQL Server Management Studio to your Remote database. If it connects it means problem is at the code side or at Visual Studio side if you are using the one.  
 Check the connectionstring, if the problem persists, check these two services: 
 
 Distributed Transaction Coordinator service  
 SQL Server services. 
 
 Go in services.msc and search and start these two services.  
 The above answer works for the Exception:
[Win32Exception (0x80004005): The network path was not found] 
 
 Same problem with me. I solved this by adding   before connection string (C# has a thing called 'String Literals') like so: 
 
 
 As others pointed out this could be more to do with the connectionstring config
Make sure, 
 
 user id and password are correct 
 Data Source is pointing to correct one , for example if you are using SQL express it will be .\SQLEXPRESS 
 Database is pointing to correct name of database
Hope that helps. 
 
 
 Possibly also check the   tag in    
 Believe it or not, some projects I've worked on will set a connection string here as well. 
 Setting this config to:  
 
 Fixed this issue in my case after checking all other connection strings were correct. 
 
 check your Connection String Properly.
Check that the connection is open. 
 
 
 I recently had the same issue. It's more likely that your application can not connect to database server due to the network issues.  
 In my case I was connected to wrong WiFi.
