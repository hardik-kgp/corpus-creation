*** the-object-df-is-dependent-on-column-changing-int-to-double ***

 Basically I got a table in my EF database with the following properties: 
 
 It works fine however when I change the int of Rating to be a double I get the following error when updating the database: 
 **The object 'DF_**
**Movies**
**_Rating__48CFD27E' is dependent on column 'Rating'.
ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN Rating failed because one or more objects access this column.**

 What's the issue? 
 
 Try this: 
 Remove the constraint  DF_Movies_Rating__48CFD27E  before changing your field type. 
 The constraint is typically created automatically by the DBMS (SQL Server). 
 To see the constraint associated with the table, expand the table attributes in  **Object explorer**
, followed by the category  Constraints  as shown below: 
 
 You must remove the constraint before changing the field type. 
 
 This is the   way 
 
 For completeness, this just shows @Joe Taras's comment as an answer 
 
 I'm adding this as a response to explain where the constraint comes from.
I tried to do it in the comments but it's hard to edit nicely there :-/ 
 If you create (or alter) a table with a column that has default values it will create the constraint for you. 
 In your table for example it might be: 
 
 It will create the constraint for default 100. 
 If you instead create it like so 
 
 Then you get a nicely named constraint that's easier to reference when you are altering said table. 
 
 You can combine those last 2 statements so you alter the column and name the constraint in one line (you have to if it's an existing table anyways) 
 
 As constraint has unpredictable name, you can write special script( DropConstraint ) to remove it without knowing it's name (was tested at EF 6.1.3): 
 
 
 When we try to drop a column which is depended upon then we see this kind of error: 
 
 The object 'DF__*' is dependent on column ''. 
 
 drop the constraint which is dependent on that column with:  
 
 **Example:**
  
 
 Msg 5074, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 
 The object ' **DF__Employees__Colf__1273C1CD'**
 is dependent on column 'Colf'. 
 Msg 4922, Level 16, State 9, Line 1 
 ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN Colf failed because one or more objects access this column. 
 
 **Drop Constraint(DF__Employees__Colf__1273C1CD):**
  
 
 **Then you can Drop Column:**
  
 
 
 MS SQL Studio take care of when you delete the column but if you need to  **Delete Constraint Programmatically**
 here is simple solution 
 Here’s a code snippet that’ll drop a column with a default constraint: 
 
 Just replace  **TableName**
 and  **ColumnName**
 with the appropriate values.  You can safely run this even if the column has already been dropped. 
 **Bonus**
:  Here’s the code to drop foreign keys and other types of constraints.

 **Solution :**

 open database table -> expand table -> expand constraints and see this 
 
 
 I had this error trying to run a migration
to work around it I renamed the column and re-generated the migration using 
 
 in the package manager console. I was then able to run 
 
 successfully.
