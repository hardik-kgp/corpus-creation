 The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived
  tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP, OFFSET
  or FOR XML is also specified. 
 
 I am getting the above said error while trying to execute the following query. Can anyone please have a look and tell me what am I doing wrong here? 
 
 
 You do not need to use   in inner query after   clause because you have already used it in  .
