*** this-is-not-a-number-error-in-phpmyadmin ***

 I am trying to create a user table this way: 
 
 But I am getting this error: 
 
 This is not a number 
 
 What am I doing wrong? 
 
 You need to provide the  **VARCHAR**
 length (the number of characters). The length should be a numeric value. then you can get rid of the error. 
 
 INT type have 4 bytes storage capacity so you can only give max lenght of 11. 
 Check  this  for more details 
 
 You're trying to create a primary key that can store an integer of length  . 
 Consult this table: 
 Type  | Use | Size   
 
 TINYINT | A very small integer | The signed range is  **–128 to 127**
. The unsigned range is  **0 to 255**
.  
 SMALLINT | A small integer | The signed range is  **–32768 to 32767**
. The unsigned range is  **0 to 65535.**
  
 MEDIUMINT | A medium-size integer | The signed range is  **–8388608 to 8388607**
. The unsigned range is  **0 to 16777215**
  
 INT or INTEGER | A normal-size integer | The signed range is  **–2147483648 to 2147483647**
. The unsigned range is  **0 to 4294967295**

 BIGINT | A large integer | The signed range is  **–9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.**
 The unsigned range is  **0 to 18446744073709551615**

 
 As a result, PhpMyAdmin won't create the field as it exceeds the maximum allowed length for that type (INT).
