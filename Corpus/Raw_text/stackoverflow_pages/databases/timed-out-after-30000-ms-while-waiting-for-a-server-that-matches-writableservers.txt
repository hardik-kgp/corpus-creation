*** timed-out-after-30000-ms-while-waiting-for-a-server-that-matches-writableservers ***

 I have seen this problem at many forums but none of them resolved my issue. I am trying to insert a sample document to MongoDB DB. Unfortunately, during the insert process   I got following error: 
 
 SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet spring threw exception
  com.mongodb.MongoTimeoutException: Timed out after 30000 ms while
  waiting for a server that matches WritableServerSelector. Client view
  of cluster state is {type=UNKNOWN, servers=[{address=localhost:27017,
  type=UNKNOWN, state=CONNECTING,
  exception={com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening
  socket}, caused by {java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused:
  connect}}]    at
  com.mongodb.connection.BaseCluster.createTimeoutException(BaseCluster.java:369) 
 
 Here is my connectToDb method  
 
 My pom.xml :

 You can fix this error by running mongo as  
 Otherwise, try updating your mongo-driver version to match that of the server you are running.
