 I already have a database in SQL Server 2012 Enterprise edition. 
 It contains : 
 
 tables 
 views 
 procedures 
 objects 
 
 Now I want to downgrade the database to SQL Server 2008 Enterprise edition. I know there is no direct option. I tried to  backup on 2012 and then restore on 2008. Not working. 
 Any Idea on how to completely transfer database ? 
 
 You must export the database as text (.sql) and the import it back. See  Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard . There are also 3rd party tools, like  SQL Compare  and  SQL Data Compare . 
 
 Steps to migrate: 
 1) get the list of tables in which entry was made before in SQL Server 2012 
 2) Generate the scripts in SQL Server 2012 and in advance option select "data only" for export type 
 3) using python run the SQL statements with reference to list of step 1 insert values in SQL Server 2008
