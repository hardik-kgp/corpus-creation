*** tree-of-all-dependencies-in-a-sql-server-database ***

 I have to maintain an old project without documentation, and there is a database with a lot of tables and functions and stored procedures. I want to build a tree of dependencies between tables and stored procedures, for example, this procedure execs these procedures and uses these tables. 
 
 Is there any tool that can help me 
 If there is not, what is the start point for such algorithms? I mean that I can get source code of all procedures from database, and than parse it for all 'exec #', 'update #', 'insert into #' and so on. And in this case, what is the best way to solve this problem (regex maybe, or some special algorithms...)? 
 
 
 There are paid tools like redgate but if you want, you can always right click an object and select "view dependencies".  
 
 Higarian, your code was very useful to me.  I refined it a bit to remove circular dependencies, include table references, and to sort by the ObjectPath. 
 
 
 Here,  The max(level) should solve your problem without needing external tools 
 
 
 You can use sys.dm_sql_referenced_entities as shown below to get all dependencies of any object 
 
 
 Someone mentioned Redgate's paid add-ons.  ApexSQL is another company that makes add-ons for SQL Server.  Some of them cost money, but others are free and still pretty useful. 
 **ApexSQL Search**
 is one of the free ones.  It's 2 main features are: 
 
 Allows you to search a database's data or structure for certain text. 
 Can build a graphical tree of dependencies for one or more objects (what you want). 
 
 After you install it, just right-click an object or database and click   (near the bottom, with an icon next to it). Don't confuse it for   (near the top, without an icon next to it), which is the one built into SQL Server.  I find the hierarchical diagram layout to be the most useful.
