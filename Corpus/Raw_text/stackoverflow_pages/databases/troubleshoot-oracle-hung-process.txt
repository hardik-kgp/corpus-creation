*** troubleshoot-oracle-hung-process ***

 I'm trying to understand a problem we're having with a Java process that is hanging.  This process has been running in production for about 4 months and earlier this week it started hanging.  When I look at a thread dump of the process all of the relevant threads (3) have stacks like the following: 
 
 There are no threads waiting for locks so the process isn't deadlocked.  These 3 threads that are doing the work are just blocked waiting for a response from Oracle, at least that is what it looks like to me. 
 Looking at Oracle, when I query v$session, it looks like  one of the connections associated with these threads is currently executing a query, although I can't see the sql. 
 
 My questions are: 
 
 Am I correct in my analysis that the process is simply blocked waiting for a response from Oracle? 
 What should I be looking for in Oracle to understand why this process is blocking? 
 
 Updated: 
 Based on the comment regarding looking in DBA_WAITERS and DBA_LOCKS 
 
 There were 98 rows in dba_locks but since all are 'Not Blocking' I don't think it is a locking issue?  The process in question has been in this state for over 3 hours so any deadlock would have been detected by now. 
 I'm of the theory that the Oracle instance is not "healthy", but I'm at a loss as to what to look at.  I have a request in to reboot the Oracle server, but that hasn't been done yet. 
 Follow-up question:  Is it normal for the v$session to contain a sql_id that doesn't exist in v$sql and if so, under what conditions? 
 
 The problem was solved and the answer was right in the v$session table.  Apparently Oracle sessions can block for reasons other than just locking. Notice the column FINAL_BLOCKING_SESSION - it identifies the session that is the root cause of the blocking.
We investigated session 845 and found that the client process (identified by MACHINE and PORT) no longer existed.  The DBA killed session 845 and all returned to normal. 
 
 
 I also encountered this problem recently, and used this query find locking/locked sessions in Oracle:
