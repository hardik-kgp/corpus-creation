*** troubleshooting-error-unable-to-serialize-database-when-performing-dumpdata ***

 For some reason today I cannot dump my database using   or from a link that can download the mysql file. 
 I tried to use   and here is the information I have. 
 
 It says  . I wonder if it has something to do with a Foreign key or something. 
 **models.py**

 
 From my models.py, the field user, datetime and note were added recently. Now if for a client, any of these fields do not have a value i.e. blank, I will get the error  . 
 When I have looked up user, dateime and note in mysql. The table for Client shows user_id, datetime and note to have Null values (which is what I want).  Why does it not allow Null values?

 You need to tell Django that it should allow NULL values on those recently added fields. It looks only at the fields definition, it doesn't fetch the schema from the database.  
 The   error is most likely raised when a client doesn't have an user associated and   is accessed. It's because by default all fields are required. If you change your model definition as shown bellow, the error should go away.  
 
 
  allows   respectively   values on a field. 
  allows you to leave the the field empty in a model form
(eg. in the admin). 
 
 (  and   are both   by default)
