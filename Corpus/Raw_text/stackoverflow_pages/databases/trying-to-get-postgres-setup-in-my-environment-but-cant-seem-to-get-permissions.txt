 I'm following the recent RailsCast on setting up PostgreSQL, but I'm unable to run the   command. Each time I run it, I get this error: 
 
 
 This should work just fine: 
 
 use your username in place of construct. So, if your computer username is WDurant, the code will be: 
 
 
 If you run on  **arch linux**
, use like this : 
 
 
 You actually need to   to the   user  
 
 
 
 then you can run the command 
 
  (I prefer setting this now because UTF8 is quite flexible and this will create all clusters as UTF8 [unless you explicitly specify otherwise]) 
 
 then you need to create your user (if it hasn't already been created) 
 
 
  (this appears to be  ) 
 
 then you can exit out of postgres user and you can create your own database 
 
 
 
 
 Which user are you running initdb as? If you're not root, you likely don't have permission to create directories in /usr/local. I suggest creating /usr/local/var/postgres as root, and chown'ing it to construct: 
 
 Then your initdb (run as construct) should have permission. 
 Also, note that Unix usernames are normally all-lowercase (but also case-sensitive); are you  sure  your Construct user is actually capitalized? If so, are you  really sure  your want it to be capitalizedâ€”-a lot of things will break. 
 (FYI: For Unix questions like this, you may find  Unix.SE  or  Ask Ubuntu  provide quicker answers)
