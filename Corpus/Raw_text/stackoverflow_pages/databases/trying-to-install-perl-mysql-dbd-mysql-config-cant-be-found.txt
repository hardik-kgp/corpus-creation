PLEASE NOTE:

For 'make test' to run properly, you must ensure that the 
database user 'root' can connect to your MySQL server 
and has the proper privileges that these tests require such 
as 'drop table', 'create table', 'drop procedure', 'create procedure'
as well as others. 

mysql> grant all privileges on test.* to 'root'@'localhost' identified by 's3kr1t';

You can also optionally set the user to run 'make test' with:

perl Makefile.pl --testuser=username

 I've researched the issue and tried making a symlink to no avail. 
 Do I have to compile this myself? 
 
 If you installed the mysql server that everybody installs:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server  (or something like this) 
 you are missing a few extra files on which the makefile for this perl module depends. 
 You can try to work around this issue by installing the  following package: 
 
 REFERECE:
 http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RUDY/DBD-mysql-2.9008/INSTALL.html#configuration 
 
 Applying to ubuntu/debian users (I'm running U-12.0.4), it was suggested above that users do: 
 
 But then there is another problem with the maketest portion of the install where the "password: NO" FAILED. To bypass that test, just use force: 
 
 
 if u r using ubuntu , u can easily install using the below  
 
 for more detail check the cpan  install.pod  consist detail about other Linux flavor  
 
 Install the mysql-devel package that pertains to your distro and mysql server version. 
 
 You just need mysql-server and mysql-devel installed locally so that cpan can build the module, you can probably remove the mysql server afterwards. 
 
 Find the script   under your MySQL directory, and run   like: 
 
 
 If you try to install via CPAN you cannot, as far as I know, set the   option directly. And, including the directory containing mysql_config in the PATH environment variable does not seem to help. 
 However, if you do have the file mysql_config available somewhere, you can do the following to make the install succeed: 
 
 Then, remove the symbolic link after the DBD::mysql installation. 
 The tests during install will still fail, unless you have installed MySQL in some central/default location on your system, but installation will still succeed. 
 If you do not have mysql_config available, you can get it from a tar.gz download of the MySQL Community Server from  mysql.com . It will be located in the bin/ subdirectory of the extracted files. If you want to have MySQL installed on your system, a better option is probably to download the RPMs and install them, or install via the package management system of your OS. 
 
 Try   for CentOS 7 and then 
run the required Perl module installation such as  
 
 I was getting make test errors. This helped me;
