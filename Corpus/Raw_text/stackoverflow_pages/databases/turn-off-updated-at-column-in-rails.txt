*** turn-off-updated-at-column-in-rails ***

 I have a simple "Log" model, that records the fact of calling controller's action. 
 Entries of this "log" record are supposed to be created once and never altered. Also, I will have many of these records in the database. 
 So, there is no need for "updated_at" column (don't need to waste the memory on HDD). 
 How can I tell to Rails to leave only "created_at" column and not to use "updated_at"? 
 Is there any way to make the "Log" model read only? 
 
 You can make the model readonly by adding a   method to the model. 
 
 The example above was adopted from  here . 
 If you don't need the   column, just remove (or don't add it) it from your database. Rails won't update what's not there. 
 
 I presume you have the   column because you used the   shorthand in your model's migration file. If you don't want the column then you can specify what you do want explicitly:
