*** typeerror-tuple-indices-must-be-integers-not-str ***

 I am trying to pull data from a database and assign them to different lists.
this specific error is giving me a lot of trouble "TypeError: tuple indices must be integers, not str" 
i tried converting it to float and etc, but to no success. 
 the code goes as below 
 
 sample output of print statement is as follows : 
 
 and this is the exact error i am getting: 
 
 any help would be appreciated ! thanks people ! 
 
 Like the error says,   is a tuple, so you can't do  . You need to use the index:  . 
 
 TL;DR: add the parameter   at the end of your  . 
 
 I had a working code and the DB moved, I had to change the host/user/pass. After this change, my code stopped working and I started getting this error. Upon closer inspection, I copy-pasted the connection string on a place that had an extra directive. The old code read like: 
 
 Which was replaced by: 
 
 The parameter   at the end was making python allow me to access the rows using the column names as index. But the poor copy-paste eliminated that, yielding the error. 
 So, as an alternative to the solutions already presented, you can also add this parameter and access the rows in the way you originally wanted. ^_^ I hope this helps others. 
 
 The Problem is how you access    
 Specifically   and   of  
 If you look up the  official-documentation  of   you find. 
 
 The method fetches all (or all remaining) rows of a query result set and returns a list of tuples. 
 
 Therefore you have to access the values of rows with   like  
 
 I think you should do  
 
 If you wanna access by name.
