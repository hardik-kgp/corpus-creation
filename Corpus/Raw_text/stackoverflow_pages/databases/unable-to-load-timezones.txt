*** unable-to-load-timezones ***

 I am attempting to load timezones into my MySql instance (that is running on Ubuntu) so that I can use the CONVERT_TZ function but when I run the command below: 
 
 I get the following output and when I try to use   it just returns   still:

 Does anyone have an idea why this would be happening? 
 PS: 
 I'm using the following method to convert datetimes: 
 
 Is it possible that I'm just converting incorrectly and that is the cause of the NULL results? 
 
 This is a bug with the timezone files for Riyadh* on Debian:

 The recommended workaround is to simply ignore the warning (if you don't need those timezone of course): 
 
 After importing TZ data with the   option, you will be able to use  . Here is a transcription of what I've just done: 
 
 
 Unfortunately, Sylvain's solution didn't worked for me. 
 I was able to populate the timezone tables of our production server by exporting the tables from the   of my development computer (on Windows) and tweaking the creation script a little bit. 
 Since the script is too long to be shared in a post, I will host it on my Google Drive. 
 The install script (with new lines and comments stripped):

 The script with comments:

 Make sure to use the version without comments. The comment version take about 5 minutes to run and end up failing for some reason while the stripped version take less than 5 seconds to run. 
 **Note**
: You'll probably need to run as   in order for this to work.
