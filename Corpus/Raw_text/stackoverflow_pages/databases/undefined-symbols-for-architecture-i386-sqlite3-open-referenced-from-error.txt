 I have create a database class and packaged some methods. However, once build the project... 
 
 here are some critical methods: 
 create the database:     
 
 create tables: 
 
 close the database: 
 
 update tables:  
 
 select records: 
 
 
 You need to add the libsqlite library into linking process. This can be done in the Project Settings, see  https://stackoverflow.com/a/7623043/1091195 .
