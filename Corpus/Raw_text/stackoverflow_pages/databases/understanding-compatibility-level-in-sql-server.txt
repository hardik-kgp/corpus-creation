*** understanding-compatibility-level-in-sql-server ***

 I understood that setting a database to a COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL prior to your native one prevented features from being used. However this doesn't seem to be the case. Witness the following SQL script: 
 
 But this table creates perfectly - any ideas? I would have thought some kind of an error message or warning would have been appropriate 
 
 Here you can read about the differences between compatibility level 80, 90 and 100.  ALTER DATABASE Compatibility Level 
 Apparently new data types is not affected. I think that compatibility level is there to make SQL Server "behave" like the older version, not prevent you from doing new fancy stuff.   
 
 BOL  says: 
 
 Compatibility level provides only
  partial backward compatibility with
  earlier versions of SQL Server. 
 
 Also: 
 
 New functionality might work under
  older compatibility levels, but SET
  options might require adjustments. 
 
 I believe that is your case. 
 
 I understand this is an old post, but for anyone else who ends up here as I did, more information is always helpful. 
 It could also be that the new compatibility did not take effect before running the create table statement. 
 "The new compatibility setting for a database takes effect when a USE Database is issued or a new login is processed with that database as the default database."
