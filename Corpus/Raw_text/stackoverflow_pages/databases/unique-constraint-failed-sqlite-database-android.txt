 I am trying to insert values in table. But there is only one value inserted. I am getting an error in log cat when I am trying to insert new values.  
 Log cat shows : 
 
 Its showing error on these two lines while inserting row.

 How to solve this?? 
 
 Your code probably violates primary key's uniqueness constraint on a   field. 
 Two possible solutions are: 
 
 Make sure that your   returns unique values per object. For now, I don't see you pass any identifier to its constructor and perhaps all the events are inserted with the same   value. 
 If you don't care about generating ids by yourself, you can add   setting to your   column definition. This way   field will be filled automatically and each row will have its own, unique value. Once there, don't forget to remove adding   to   by yourself. 
 
 
 For developers using  Room Persistence Library . You can use  
 
 in DAO according to  Insert Documentation 
 
 The table has a unique constraint on it.  That means that only one row can exist with a given ID value.  If you're trying to change some of the values for a row, use UPDATE not INSERT.  If you're trying to add this row, you need to either give it a different, unique ID or you need to delete the pre-existing row first.  Which of these is the right answer depends on what your app is doing. 
 
 Try checking if the ID is already existed. If true, do not insert, because you already have the row with this ID. 
 
 If you use  **Room**
 then instead of   you should use  
 and make your id variable optional: 
 
 and then when adding a new item, pass   as id,   func will return new id, add it to your object 
 
 
 make id column id integer autoincrement, and do not put the id value into content values. 
 
 My mistake was, I tried to fill   column though it was defined already as a  
 
 I originally put the new unique constraint infant of the old one. Instead make sure you're current unique column is first: 
 
 
 I had the same problem and the problem was that I forgot to add   in my
