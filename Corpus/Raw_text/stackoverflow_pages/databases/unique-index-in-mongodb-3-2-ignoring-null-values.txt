*** unique-index-in-mongodb-3-2-ignoring-null-values ***

 I want to add the unique index to a field ignoring null values in the unique indexed field and ignoring the documents that are filtered based on partialFilterExpression. 
 The problem is Sparse indexes can't be used with the Partial index.  
 Also, adding unique indexes, adds the null value to the index key field and hence the documents can't be ignored based on $exist criteria in the PartialFilterExpression. 
 Is it possible in MongoDB 3.2 to get around this situation? 
 
 I am adding this answer as I was looking for a solution and didn't find one. This may not answer exactly this question or may be, but will help lot of others out there like me. 
 Example. If the field with   is   and it is of type  , the solution can be like this 
 
 This will ignore the   values in the field   and still be unique. 
 
 Yes, you can create partial index in MongoDB 3.2 
 Please see  https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/index-partial/#index-type-partial 
 MongoDB recommend usage of partial index over sparse index. I'll suggest you to drop your sparse index in favor of partial index.
