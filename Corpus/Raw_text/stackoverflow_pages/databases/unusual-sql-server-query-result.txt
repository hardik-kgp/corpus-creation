*** unusual-sql-server-query-result ***

 Let's say I have a table called  : 
 
 and when I run a query like: 
 
 it returns me an empty result set while I have row with   where   is different than  ?  
 Using  . 
 Any ideas? 
 Edit: Possibility to be duplicate with suggested answer may be at one point but does not cover at all and it shows how to use null values when compared with null but what I wanted to ask was about the result set which includes null values 
 
 This is the intended behavior. You cannot compare   values using   or  . You have to use   or  . 
 If you want   values only use  : 
 
 If you want   values with   values, use: 
 
 
 The expression 
 
 does not return   or  , but actually returns  .  This means that the third record in your table will not be returned by your query. 
 As @ughai mentioned, you should use   instead to query that record: 
 
 Have a look at the  Microsoft SQL Server documentation  for more information. 
 
 When you are dealing with   you should be always careful because of 3 valued logic used in  (when a predicate can be evaluated to  ,   or  ). Now here is a classic   statement where many newcomers make a mistake, suggesting that the statement would return all rows where   including  .  
 But if you know the easy fact that comparing   to any value, even to   itself will evaluate to   it is getting more clear what is going on.   clause will return  **ONLY**
 those rows where predicate is evaluated to  . Rows where predicate evaluates to   or   will be filtered out from resultset. 
 Now let's see what is going on behind the scene. You have 4 rows: 
 
 and the predicate is: 
 
 When you evaluate this predicate for each row you get: 
 
 Now remember that   clause will return only rows where predicate evaluates to   and it is clear that you will not get any result because no row evaluates to  .
