 I've been using the zipcode information from here: 
 http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2010.html 
 in my mySQL database but I've noticed that it's missing quite a few zipcodes  
 (ex. 94142, San Francisco, CA) 
 ....does anyone know of some more up to date zip code data? 
 
 Try the data at  http://www.geonames.org/ 
 (There's a Free postal Code Data link there, with postal codes for lots of countries). 
 
 The United States Postal Service is the government entity that provisions ZIP codes.  As such, the authoritative, always-correct database is theirs. 
 Happily, they provide free APIs that developers can use:

 The reason why the Census Bureau doesn't have all ZIP Codes is because they only contain the ones with populations (general delivery addresses) and don't contain ZIPs for PO Boxes. 
 
 I get mine zip codes, and more, from  here . This also includes latitude and longitude information, which makes calculating distances between locations possible.
