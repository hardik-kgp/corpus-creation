 Need to update a field with data from another field in a different database 
 I Have two SQL commercial Databases from the same company, the first Database has one field that is null in the other 
 I need to update the Field/Database that is null with the data of the first one. 
 
 **MS SQL Server**

 Update table1 in current database from table1 in database called "DataBaseName"
