 Hope it help some one  
 **NOTE:**

    Adding comments from @pim (in comments) 
 
 
 I used the following commands to add a new YUM repo and make the update: 
 **Download the Remi repo**

 
 **Install/Update the mysql version**

 
 OR 
 
 
 You appear to have been using the wrong Webtatic Yum repository version than the one for your version of CentOS. See  http://www.webtatic.com/projects/yum-repository/  for details 
 e.g. 
 
 You can use a yum plugin made by the IUS community to switch mysql-libs with mysql55w-libs. (the following assuming you still use Webtatic) 
 
 That should allow you to replace mysql with mysql55w-libs, whilst maintaining the older libmysqlclient for any dependencies. 
 If you see other packages than mysql being removed, then be careful, as they might be needed, but using this method, I've found to be reliable whenever I've used it. 
 I'm posting this solution as Remi's repository is not always the ideal solution. This method is more complex, but would never cause you to accidentally update your entire web stack by using repositories that use package names matching base distribution packages.

 **-- This will upgrade to mysql 5.6 community not 5.5 --**

 This worked for me after some research and mixing/matching/testing the answers found on various page of the internet (mainly from this page and  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/linux-installation-yum-repo.html ).
My OS shipped with mysql 5.1, I wanted to have 5.6. 
 **My system**

 
 This is installed on a 2006 mac pro 1.1 (CPUs upgraded to 3.0GHz Intel Xeon X5365 Quad-Core). 
 **Commands I ran**

 This was done almost immediately after a fresh install of the OS and system update via yum 
 **list mysql currently installed**

 
 **remove installed msql**

 
 **list mysql currently installed**

 
 **Download rpm containing mysql 5.6**

 
 **Install mysql**

 
 **list mysql currently installed**

 
 **ensure mysql starts on reboot**

 
 **Start mysql**

 
 **Result**

 
 **mysql config (I did not touch this yet but the info seems legit)**

 **Good luck!**

 Edit 
 I had some issues creating users and granting permissions, this how it was fixed. 
 **Error**

 
 **Fix**

 
 Logged on the server as root 
 Connected to mysql with a simple  
 Checked the outcome of this statement:    The result was 39, 43 is expected for mysql 5.6 
 Issued this statement to update the root password:  
 (Logged off mysql with  ) 
 Restarted mysql with:  
 Ran:  
 Reconnected to mysql with  
 Checked the outcome of this statement:    The result was 43 as expected for mysql 5.6. I was then able to create my users and grant permissions as needed. 
 
 
 Above replies didn't work for me (got this error - error: /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.tyukGy: not an rpm package). 
 I followed these steps -  
 
 Taken from -  http://www.tecmint.com/install-mysql-on-rhel-centos-6-5-fedora-17-12/ 
 By doing above, i uninstalled MySQL 5.0.* and replaced it with this -  
 
 My CentOS version -  
 
 
 Use CentOS-Release-SCL is better and easy. 
 The Software Collections ( SCL ) Repository 
 
 Done. 
 
 This blog post  helped me upgrade from MySQL 5.5.15 to 5.5.28. That upgrade also had the problem with   clashing with  .
