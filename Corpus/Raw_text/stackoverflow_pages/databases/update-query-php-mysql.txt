*** update-query-php-mysql ***

 Can anybody help me understand why this update query isn't updating the fields in my database? I have this in my php page to retrieve the current values from the database: 
 
 Here i my HTML Form: 
 
 and here is my 'editblogscript': 
 
 I don't understand why it doesn't work. 
 
 You have to have single quotes around any VARCHAR content in your queries. So your update query should be: 
 
 Also, it is bad form to update your database directly with the content from a POST. You should sanitize your incoming data with the mysql_real_escape_string function. 
 
 Without knowing what the actual error you are getting is I would guess it is missing quotes. try the following: 
 
 
 Need to add quote for that need to use dot operator: 
 
 
 **Here i updated two variables and present date and time**

 $id    = "1"; 
$title = "phpmyadmin";  
 
 now() function update current date and time. 
 
 
 First, you should define "doesn't work". 
Second, I assume that your table field 'content' is varchar/text, so you need to enclose it in quotes.  
And last but not least: use   directly after a query to debug. 
 
 I would guess it is missing quotes. Try the following:
I hope It will work properly 
 $sql=  mysql_query("UPDATE table_name SET id ='".$u_id."', name = '".$u_name."',now() WHERE id = '".$u_id."' ");
//linebreak 
 
 you must write single quotes then double quotes then dot before name of field and after like that 
 
 
 Update a row or column of a table 
 
 
 
 
 Try like this in sql query, It will work fine. 
 
 If you have to update multiple columns,
Use like this,
