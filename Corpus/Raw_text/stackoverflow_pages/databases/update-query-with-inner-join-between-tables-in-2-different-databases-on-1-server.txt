*** update-query-with-inner-join-between-tables-in-2-different-databases-on-1-server ***

 Need some SQL syntax help :-) 
 Both databases are on the same server 
 
 I can do a query in Access with linked tables with similar syntax - BUT SQL doesn't like it. 
 I'm sure it's a simple issue :-D 
 Thanks! 
 
 You could call it just style, but I prefer aliasing to improve readability. 
 
 For MySQL 
 
 
 Following is the  MySQL syntax:

 Sorry its late, but I guess it would be of help to those who land here finding a solution to similar problem. 
The set clause should come right after the update clause. So rearranging your query with a bit change does the work. 
 
 
 
 for me until the syntax worked -MySQL 
 
 Should look like this: 
 
 Update table is repeated in FROM clause. 
 
 which may be useful 
 
 
 It is explained here  http://erabhinavrana.blogspot.in/2014/01/how-to-execute-update-query-by-applying.html 
 It also has other useful code snippets which are commonly used. 
 
 Replace data in   with your appropriate values. 
 That's It.
