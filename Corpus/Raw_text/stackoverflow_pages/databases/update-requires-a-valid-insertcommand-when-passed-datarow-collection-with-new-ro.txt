 The connection to the database works ( i have retrieved info from the db ) 
 Any ideas ? 
 
 You must define an InsertCommand for you DataAdapter 
 http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/relationaladonet.aspx 
 
 For adding DataRows: 
 
 Explanation: 
  will try to save the changes in the   to the database. It will need: 
 
 **InsertCommand**
 (if   were added) 
 **DeleteCommand**
 (if   were deleted) 
 **UpdateCommand**
 (if   were modified) 
 
 You can put a breakpoint to inspect your   before the   line to see if it is set. 
 To set them, simply create a   and fire  ,  , etc. 
 This should solve the errors: 
 
 "Update requires a valid Update Command when passed DataRow collection with modified rows." Or 
 "Update requires a valid Insert Command when passed DataRow collection with new rows.", etc. 
 
 See  MSDN Link  for More Info
