 I want to implement a SQL statement using codeigniter active record. 
 
 How can I implement this using Codeigniter active records?

 You can also use something like this 
 
 UPDATE: $data was not being passed on to update 
 
 I find its sometimes simpler to just write the SQL rather than having Active Record build it for me.
