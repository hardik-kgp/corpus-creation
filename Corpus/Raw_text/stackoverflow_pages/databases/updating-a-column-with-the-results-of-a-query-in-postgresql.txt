*** updating-a-column-with-the-results-of-a-query-in-postgresql ***

 I have the following table in PostgreSQL 9.2 which contains time stamps: 
 gid [PK] (bigserial), timestamp_mes (timestamp without time zone), time_diff (interval)    
1, 2012-01-23 11:03:40, empty 
2, 2012-01-23 11:03:42, empty 
3, 2012-01-23 11:03:44, empty 
 I have added a interval column (time_diff) and would like to fill it with time difference values resulting from this query: 
 
 I have tried the following query to update the time_diff column, with no success: 
 
 This results in an error: 
 
 ERROR:  more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression 
 
 How should I proceed to update the time_diff column with the values resulting from the time difference query? 
 
 Something like this: 
 
 
 You can't directly use a window function in an UPDATE, so you instead need to use it in a sub-SELECT - which you have done. However, the way you've tried to use that sub-SELECT in your UPDATE is not valid syntax. You need to put the sub-SELECT in the FROM clause of your update, as explained by the Postgres docs here: 
 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-update.html 
 The correct syntax for what you want to do is: 
 
 Obviously, you'll need to substitute in the column name of some unique id that your rows have where I've written  
 
 Actually you are getting this error because your subquery returns multiple result, 
 I am not able to understand your query so, 
 I will give you an example to solve it,

 :-your_operation means the logic of finding time difference,
