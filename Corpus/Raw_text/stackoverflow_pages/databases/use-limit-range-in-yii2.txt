*** use-limit-range-in-yii2 ***

 I want to get data from db using  **limit 12,20**
 .  
 Here is my code: 
 
 It is not working. It is giving me all rows. I also tried   **->limit([12,20])**
, not working.    
 But when I am using   **limit(12)**
 then I am getting 12 rows.  
 I want to get rows in  **limit 12,20**
 . What should I have to do for that in my this code? 
 
 Try this: 
 
  specifies the starting point and   specifies the Number of records. If you want records between   and   then use  .
