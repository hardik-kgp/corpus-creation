*** using-an-alias-in-sql-calculations ***

 Why won't this query work? 
 
 In this example, I'm trying to use the my_num alias in other calculations.  This results in unknown column "my_num" 
 This is a simplified version of what I am trying to do, but basically I would like to use an alias to make other calculations.  My calculations are much more complicated and thats why it would be nice to alias it since I repeat it several times different ways. 
 
 Simply wrap your reused alias with   : 
 
 
 You'll need to use a subselect to use that aliases that way 
 
 
 Aliases in sql are not like variables in a programming language.  Aliases can only be referenced again at certain points (particularly in   and   clauses).  But you can't reuse an alias in the   clause.  So you can use a derived query (such as suggested by  Rubens Farias ) which lets you basically rename your columns and/or name any computed columns. 
 Or you could use a   if your formulas are generally fixed 
 
 I believe that will be slightly faster than using a derived query but it probably depends a lot on your real query. 
 Or you could just duplicate the work: 
 
 Which might be convenient in something like php/perl:
