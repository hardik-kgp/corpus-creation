*** using-coalesce-to-handle-null-values-in-postgresql ***

 I have the following query  
 
 The above query returns the o/p as shown in the attached image
 
 **However I want to replace all null values by 0 using COALESCE**

Please let me know how this can be achieved in above SELECT query 
 Now I further modified the query using coalesce as below 
 
 the result of which is as attached in image 2. 
 I still receive one row with blank values 
 
 
 You can use   in conjunction with   for a short, efficient solution: 
 
 The   function  will return null if yourField is equals to the second value (  in this case), making the   function fully working on all cases: 
 
 
 If you're using   and an empty string   and   to designate undefined you've got a data problem. Just update the columns and fix your schema. 
 
 This will make joining and selecting substantially easier moving forward.
