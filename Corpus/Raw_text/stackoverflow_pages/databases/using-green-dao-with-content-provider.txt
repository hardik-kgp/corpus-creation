*** using-green-dao-with-content-provider ***

 I am planning to use   in my project. I had already tested it by creating a test project. However, I have couple of requirements, which I need to fulfill. 
 
 Database of my app will be encrypted. To do so, we are planning to use  SQLCipher . I found this  link . I am studying it, but interested to know is there anything available in original GreenDAO project. 
 As my app will sync data to/from the server, I'll use  SyncAdapter  as I don't want to do all heavylifting by myself which is already done by Android framework. But it requires   to work with. So, how can I use GreenDAO with  . 
 
 **Update 2**

 My project has seven entities. I used   over entities. And seven different content providers are generated. Is there any way to have all sqlite tables in a single content provider?  
 
 I have a project running with greenDao and a content provider. First I was using  ProviGen  just to generate the content provider and query with the content resolver but then the project turned to be very large so I decided to implement greenDAO, what I did is to use the contentProvider  created in provigen to get the database from it, so now I have both the contentProvider and provigen attached to the same database. I encourage you to create your ContentProvider and attach your daoMaster to the database generated with it.  Here is the piece of code I used in the onCreate Application Class: 
 
 after that to use greendao just : 
 
 And there you can have both contentProvider and greenDao. If you have not started your project yet then create the content provider manually and create the DaoMaster with the same code in here. Good Luck
