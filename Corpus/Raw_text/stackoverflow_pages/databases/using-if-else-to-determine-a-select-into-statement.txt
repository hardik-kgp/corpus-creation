 I'm having some strange issues using IF / ELSE to determine which one or two SELECT statements to execute. The error message I'm getting when running the full statement is that my temporary table already exists, but that does not occur if I run two separate executions of two separate IF statements.  
 Here is the code in SQL Server: 
 
 
 It's a "feature" of the syntax checking in SQL Server. You simply cannot "create" a #temporary table twice within the same batch. 
 This is the pattern you need. 
 
 If you prefer, you can also express the branch (in this case) as a WHERE clause: 
 
 
 You can't use SELECT INTO for a tables with same name in the same batch. Use a different name for a temporary table 
 
 
 From what I understand the problem is this: 
 When you run the below statement, 
 
 you are creating a temp table on the fly. 
 If before that line you had a create table statement, then this Select into statement will fail because the table already exists. 
 If in your case you already have a temp table created, then try replacing: 
 
 with: 
 
 Also look at  There is already an object named '##Temp' in the database
