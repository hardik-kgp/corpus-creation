*** using-insert-method-to-insert-datetime-value-with-php-doctrine-dbal-2 ***

 How can i pass PHP's  **DateTime**
 object as a value for database field using  **Doctrine\DBAL**
? 
 **$DB**
 is a  **Doctrine\DBAL\Connection**
 instance. 
 
 The code above is not working and documentation is scarce. 
 I knew for sure that you can provide  **DateTime**
 objects directly using another DBAL methods, is it possible to do this with  **insert()**
? 
 
 
 Did the trick! ))
