 I'm new in creating databases in MySQL. I've done creating tables in MySQL Workbench. Now I want to check the databases I've created using the MySQL Command Line Client. How should I do this? What should I type in the Command Line? Please help. Thanks. 
 
 To see all databases: 
 
 To switch to a specific database (note that the trailing   is  optional  here): 
 
 To see the tables within the current database: 
 
 To see the   statement for a specific table: 
 
 To see other misc info about a specific table: 
 
 Additionally, all kinds of other interesting meta information is contained within the   database. You can   and explore those tables for a wealth of information about your databases. 
 Another useful trick in the MySQL command line console is to terminate your queries with   instead of  . This causes output to be displayed all vertically rather than in a table, which is useful for tables that are wider than your screen display.
