 I've seen it's possible to make a connection between Mathematica and MySQL databases using  "] and   (in case anyone wants to give it a try). Documentation of DatabaseLink  here , by the way. 
 Does anyone have experience using Mathematica in this way, probably to analyze data contained in the database? Are there obvious drawbacks (speed, memory needed, etc.)? 
 
 I recently used databases to speed up a   block. 
 Without the database, essential data from a 150 MB ASCII file were required in memory for access.  As a result, the   block slowed down.  It's possible that   would have helped.  I didn't investigate this. 
 With the database, the speed of access of individual datasets is slightly slower than a   block, but the memory footprint is down by a factor of nearly 10. 
 I'd say go for it. 
 
 I have not used   with MySQL, but I have used it extensively with Oracle, SQL Server and HSQLDB.  Most of my   usage has been on Mathematica versions 6 through 8, on Windows.  I have used it for both reading and writing, sometimes with very large data sets.  My experience has been that the facility works as expected.  I did not run into any unusual situations involving performance or memory.  I would expect you to find SQL access in Mathematica to be comparable to what you have experienced in other languages.  In particular, it performs very much like using Java -- presumably because Mathematica uses Java internally to do all of the heavy lifting. 
 I will mention that the "obvious" way to execute queries in Mathematica,  SQLExecute , will read the entire result set into memory.  If you want work with large result sets without running out of memory, take a look at the result set functions  SQLResultSetOpen et al . 
 For a very basic example of SQL use in Mathematica (using HSQLDB), see my response to  The best way to construct a function with memory .
