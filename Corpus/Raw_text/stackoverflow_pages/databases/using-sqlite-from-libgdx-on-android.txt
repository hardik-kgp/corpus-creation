*** using-sqlite-from-libgdx-on-android ***

 Does anyone have any tips on storing data from libGDX on Android in SQLite. I am very familiar with the techniques used in the Android SDK but I don't have any idea how to call those Android database functions from libGDX. I know that calling the functions from libGDX will make my game unusable on the desktop but I can deal with that. 
 
 One approach is always to create an interface in your main project, let's call it  . You then let both your desktop and your Android application/activity implement this interface. On creation of your main project you pass the application/activity along. In your main application you keep a reference to the passed interface and use this to call native functions, which you can implement for desktop and Android separately (not making your game unusable on the desktop, you can use SQLite there as well ;).  
 Ok, that was complicated, so let's see it in action (defining a function to open an URL): 
 The interface:  
 
 The main class: 
 
 The Android implementation: 
 
 The desktop implementation: 
 
 That's it, your implementation to use SQLite should probably be along the same way. Btw. I think that's also the way to integrate advertisement boxes and to talk to the system in general.
