*** using-two-foreign-keys-as-a-primary-key-mysql ***

 I am quite new to MySQL (have had to learn it for uni).
I have to create a database and web interface for an assignment. 
 On one of the tables I have two columns, both of which are foreign keys, and i need to use them both as the primary key. 
 This is the code so far: 
 
 All of the table syntax is in line with a data dictionary provided. 
 When i run this in the mysql command line, i get an error on the section highlighted in bold above (table "AuthorRole"), saying that it "cannot add foreign key constraint". 
 I have had a try at debugging it, and it seems to be the: 
 
 Foreign key that is causing the problem (if i remove it, all works well, and if i leave it in and remove the other foreign key, it gives an error). 
 If someone could please explain where i am going wrong, i would be very grateful. 
 I have tried googling this, but was unable to find anything (probably because i was using the wrong keywords). 
 Thanks  
 Cheers

 At first create the table "Role", then the table "AuthorRole" and it'll be ok 
 
 And when creating primary keys it's better to use  
 
 It is simply because you are referring to a primary key of the table which is not created at the time you refer to it, try the following sql script: 
 
 **Create table Role first and then AuthorRole.**

 
 try changeing 
 
 to  
 
 as the field and your key field are of different types
