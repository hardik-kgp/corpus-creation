*** using-webdeploy-to-deploy-database-updates ***

 We have adopted WebDeploy for a new project and it seems to handle the deployment of our apps to our Dev and Test servers pretty well.  
 Now we would like to extend the use of WebDeploy to make it deploy database changes too.  
 Scott Gu's blogpost on webdeploy  states: 
 
 Web Deploy enables you to not only
  publish files â€“ but also provision
  database schema/data, run database
  change scripts, set security ACLs, and
  more 
 
 ... but I can't find any good information on how to run database change scripts with 
WebDeploy. 
 Does anyone have guidance, advice, best-practice or informative links for this? 
 Thanks 
 Darren. 
 
 If you're using Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2010 Express then you can specify database change scripts in the Package/Publish SQL tab in your project's properties. For more information see the following article:
