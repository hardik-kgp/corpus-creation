*** vb6-adodb-recordset-recordcount-property-always-returns-1 ***

 I am trying to get some old VB6 code to work with SQL Server Compact.   
 I can connect, open the database and all seems well.  I can run insert select commands which work.   
 However the ADODB.Recordset RecordCount property always returns -1 even though I can access the Fields and see the data.  Changing the CursorLocation = adUseClient causes a problem when executung the SQL (multiple-step operation generated errors). 
 
 Any advice would be gratefully accepted. 
 
 Actually the   plays a major role in this case. Use   to set the cursor location and try. 
 
 
 That's a result of the type of cursor used to access the data, this post covers the issue and possible fixes.

 **EDIT**

 I apologize for not being more attentive to the fact that you were dealing with Compact. With Compact the situation is similar to the one I referenced, as it uses forward only cursors by default (which do not support row count) but there are two other cursor types available as documented in the link below.

 Check Recordset Property 
 The follow is result that RecordCount value returned by com.status.live code 
 
 
 Here is a solution for you that I used 
 
 
 From memory with working with VB6/ADO a long time ago the .RecordCount field doesn't return meaningful data until you've moved to the end of the recordset. 
 
 Though with this you'll need to make sure you have the appropriate cursor type (i.e., not forward only). 
 The only other solution I can think of is to do a separate SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTestTable, etc but this has issues with the data changing between that call, and the one that actually returns the rows. 
 
 With Compact the default cursor attribute is adOpenForwardOnly for improved performance.  As such RecordCount is returned as "-1" which means its not available, rather than blank.  This is by design because the # of records in a dynamic cursor could change and result in pinging back and forth between the client server to maintain accuracy.  However, if the record count is vital try setting it to use adOpenKeyset or adOpenStatic with a server-side cursor.  
 
 Try using following code if still returns -1 
 
 
 You may try something like this.. 
 
 
 Replace   with: 
 
 The   will allow a forward/backward read through to get your recordcount. 
 
 Below code might help you, 
 
 
 This following code returns the recortcount exactly...
