*** vba-code-to-close-an-access-database-without-leaving-a-shell-of-the-application ***

 I'm currently using   which leaves a shell of the MS Access Application open.   
 After processing the calling function against the target application, I am left with every instance of the application remaining open still; even though the specific database instance is closed.  
 **How do I make the database 'shell' application window close programatically using VBA?**

 Here is an example of how the variable is created and how I am closing it: 
 
 
 You need to execute Application.Quit against the instance variable. 
 For example, 
 
 
 According to the documentation:  Application.Quit  does the same thing as  DoCmd.Quit . Namely  
 
 The Quit method quits Microsoft Access. You can select one of several
  options for saving a database object before quitting. 
 
 You can try calling either of them with the parameter   or 2 which "Quits Microsoft Access without saving any objects". Upon further review, use   as   was  added for backward compatibility for Access 95  (See remarks for Quit Method as it applies to the DoCmd object.) Doing either of these should still do an automatic compact on close if you have the permissions, which may be the cause of you shells. 
 If that doesn't work for you, here is a somewhat extreme suggestion. Save this as a vbscript file and call it once you're truly done with Access. This will terminate all MSAccess processes on your windows pc, without compacting and repairing. 
 
 To call the script replacing [vbspath] with the actual path. If the path has spaces make sure to use double quotes and put it in quotes: 
 
 
 I always use  . 
This works at least in Access 2000, 2003 and 2010 (that's where I've  seen  it work). 
 
  works for me.  Maybe try that instead of  ? 
 If that doesn't solve it, your problem may be elsewhere, in which case please tell us more about this project. 
 
 DoCmd.Quit acQuitSaveAll, Worked at long last. I tried all the other options before and a shell was still hanging back.
