 Does anyone know of a good database for verb conjugations? I am building a natural language processing app. Although I've been able to make great use of WordNet it doesn't allow me to check the form of a verb in a conjugation database or conjugate other verbs. 
 I've thought about scraping a site like on of these:
     http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-english-verb-find.html 
 http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/English/find.html 
 and building my database from that. However I'd rather just download my own usable database. I'm not looking for a program or script to do this for me (not interested in NLTK)... I'd much rather a MySQL database (or something I can easily turn into a MySQL database) so I can do my own processing and computation. 
 
 This seems to be a pretty good starting point, that is a table of irregular verbs with their conjugations which can be put into a MySQL database fairly easily:

 You can also take a look at GCIDE, which contains plurals, alt spellings and conjugations, and  is in XML format.

 Take a look at  English Verb Conjugation and Inflectional Morphology  as well.
