*** version-of-sqlite-used-in-android ***

 What is the version of SQLite used in Android? 
 Reason: I'm wondering how to handle schema migrations. The newer SQLite versions support an "ALTER TABLE" SQL command which would save me having to copy data, drop the table, recreate table and re-insert data. 
 
 **UPDATE OCT 2016**
: Here is a link to the updated official docs which includes the main points in this answer:  android.database.sqlite package-level javadoc 
 Using the emulators ( ): 
 UPDATE: Since SDK 29 (emulator revision 8), the adb shell command gives: 
 
 Any ideas why? See:  https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/142003176 
 UPDATE: Sorry, older (SDK 18 and earlier) package-level API diffs have stopped working:  https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37048579

 Note: adb command to get SQLite version only works on emulators and on devices with sqlite3 available:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/3645800/444761 
 For other devices, see  Juri's answer . 
 I have added an  Issue #58909  to the Android Issue Tracker. Please star this if you would like to support it. 
 Note: if you want your app to use the same version of SQLite across all Android versions, consider using  this 3rd party SQLite support library . 
 
 Although the documentation gives 3.4.0 as reference number, if you execute the following sql, you'll notice that there is a much higher number of SQlite installed: 
 
 This is just a piece of quick, dirty code to retrieve the sqlite version. For instance on a HTC Hero with Android 2.1, I get:  **3.5.9**
. 
 On my Nexus One with Android 2.2, I even get  **3.6.22**
. 
 
 
 Same on ADP1 1.6 & 2.1 emulator.
