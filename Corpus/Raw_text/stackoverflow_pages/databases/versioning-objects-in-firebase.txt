*** versioning-objects-in-firebase ***

 I am using firebase as a database for a mobile application. Mobile application version 1 using a certain DB structure. But in version 2 I have a major schema changes. I could not find any specific documentation which would mention the best practices for managing DB upgrades. So I am thinking of following steps, which looks good on paper.  
 
 Application version 1 is in production using  firebase/v1 
 Copy version 1 schema  firebase/v1  to  firebase/v2 
 Upgrade  firebase/v2  schema  
 Disable write operations on  firebase/v1 
 Distribute application v2 pointing to  firebase/v2   
 
 With these steps users with older versions app would be able to only read the data. So unless they dont upgrade the app they wont be able to modify any data.  
 Do I going in the right direction in managing my schema updates? Or is there any better way to do this.  
 
 Use cloud function database functions to migrate data from db/v1 to db/v2. On update event in db/v1, you can write to db/v2 in parallel, so all active user data can move into db/v2.

 Migrate data asap!
