 you can't , give to view different name like 
 
 from  manual   
 
 Within a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so
  a base table and a view cannot have the same name. 
 
 
 As stated, you can't do it with views, but you  **can**
 with temporary tables. 
 If you create a temporary table with the same name as an actual table, the temporary table will  shadow  (hide) the actual table. This means that you can't access the actual table  **until**
 you have dropped the temporary table: 
 
 However, temporary tables are gone (even if you do not   them) once your session is disconnected. You'll need to re-create them every time you connect.
