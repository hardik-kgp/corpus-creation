*** view-over-multiple-tables-containing-same-columns ***

 I have four tables containing exactly the same columns, and want to create a view over all four so I can query them together. 
 Is this possible? 
 (for tedious reasons I cannot/am not permitted to combine them, which would make this irrelevant!) 
 
 Assuming that in addition to having the same column names, columns of the same contain the same data, you want to create a view that is the union of all those tables. 
 Something like the following should work, but my SQL is rusty: 
 
 
 It may be worth noting that you might need to use "union all" to preserve unique rows which may exist in more than one of the tables. A standard union will remove duplicates. 
 
 It is difficult to tell from your query whether you expect the data to be returned based on a UNION, or as a view containing the columns discretely. This obviously has an effect.  
 Consider the following sample: 
 
 Now, run the following query against this: 
 SELECT ID, Name FROM TableA
UNION ALL
SELECT ID, Name FROM TableB
UNION ALL
SELECT ID, Name FROM TableC
UNION ALL
SELECT ID, Name FROM TableD 
 This results in the following output: 
 
 Is this what you are after? If so, you use a UNION query. 
 Now, if the effect you are after is to have a discrete view of related data, you may need to do something like this: 
 
 This will result in the following view of the data: 
 
 
 Use union. 
 Here is explanation 
 
 Use the union statement 
 
 
 You can if you union them (I would suggest including some indicator as to which table each record came from): 
 
 
 Rather than UNION, use UNION ALL, unless you specifically want duplicate rows to be excluded. UNION on its own takes longer to execute (because of the sort it does to find dupes), and removes duplicate rows.
