 I've been using SQLite databases for development for a while now and I thought it would be useful to just view the contents of the generated db file.  Are there any good tools out there for viewing SQLite db files and/or tools for running queries against them? 
 
 Here are a few free tools: 
 
 SQLite Manager  (Firefox plugin) 
 SQLite Administrator 
 SQLiteSpy 
 SQLite Database Browser 
 
 I prefer SQLite Administrator, and occasionally use the Firefox version.  There are other commercial options too. 
 
 SQLite Database Browser . 
 
 **SQLite2009 Pro Enterprise Manager**

 It's free and it has a  **visual query builder**
 just like professional database management tools.
 
 Its list of features is: 
 
 Encryption Method compatible with wxSQLite3 (AES-128 bits) and
SQLite3 ADO.NET Provider (RSA-MS Crypt) 
 Syntax Highlight 
 Hex Viewer 
 Dump database to SQL file format 
 Unicode Support 
 Blob/Image viewer 
 Built-in FTS3 Extension 
 Built-in LUA Programming Language 
 Encrypted database support 
 Export recordset into excel, csv, xml and html format 
 Import data from MS Access, MS SQL server, MySQL and dBase III 
 Includes SQLite2010 Pro ODBC Driver 
 Includes Additional sqlite3 function ( ,  ,  ,
 ,  , etc) 
 Transactions supported 
 Visual Query Builder 
 Includes the user-contributed extension-functions from
 http://www.sqlite.org/contrib . 
 
 Download it from its homepage  (just scroll down to  Freeware  section) 
 
 Sqliteman  - I was looking for something light and available on Fedora repo. 
 
 I was recently introduced to  LINQpad  . I might not have as many features as some of those above (though I haven't fully explored it yet). But it's pretty sweet, for a simple query interface that works.
Plus you can practice your LINQ with it too! 
 
 Here is another database viewer nobody has mentioned:  SQLiteStudio
