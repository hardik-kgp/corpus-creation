*** views-select-contains-a-subquery-in-the-from-clause ***

 I have two tables and I need to create a view. The tables are: 
 
 I use the following query to do this. The query without the "create view" part works well but with "create view", it shows the error "View's SELECT contains a subquery in the FROM clause". What could be the issue & possible solution: 
 
 
 As per documentation:  
 MySQL Docs 
 
 The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM clause. 
 
 Your workaround would be to create a view for each of your subqueries. 
 Then access those views from within your view  
 
 
 
 As the more recent MySQL documentation on  view restrictions  says: 
 
 Before MySQL 5.7.7, subqueries cannot be used in the FROM clause of a view.  
 
 This means, that choosing a MySQL v5.7.7 or newer or upgrading the existing MySQL instance to such a version, would remove this restriction on views completely. 
 However, if you have a current production MySQL version that is earlier than v5.7.7, then the removal of this restriction on views should only be one of the criteria being assessed while making a decision as to upgrade or not. Using the workaround techniques described in the other answers may be a more viable solution - at least on the shorter run. 
 
 Looks to me as MySQL 3.6 gives the following error while MySQL 3.7 no longer errors out. I am yet to find anything in the documentation regarding this fix.
