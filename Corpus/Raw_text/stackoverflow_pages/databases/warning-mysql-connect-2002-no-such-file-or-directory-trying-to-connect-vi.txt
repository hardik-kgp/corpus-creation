*** warning-mysql-connect-2002-no-such-file-or-directory-trying-to-connect-vi ***

 I'm trying to connect to my MySQL DB with the Terminal on my Apple (With PHP). 
 Yesterday it worked fine, and now I suddenly get the error in the title. 
 The script works when I use my browser to run it (I have XAMPP installed), but Terminal refuses to connect to the DB. 
 Here is the file that I include to connect (the script works when I don't include this, but then it doesn't connect to the DB): 
 
 That should work, since it works with my browser.  
 The command I use at the Terminal is  . 
 
 For some reason mysql on OS X gets the locations of the required socket file a bit wrong, but thankfully the solution is as simple as setting up a symbolic link. 
 You may have a socket (appearing as a zero length file) as   or  , but one or more apps is looking in the other location for it. Find out with this command: 
 
 Rather than move the socket, edit config files, and have to remember to keep edited files local and away from servers where the paths are correct, simply create a symbolic link so your Mac finds the required socket, even when it's looking in the wrong place! 
 If you have   but no   then... 
 
 If you have   but no   then... 
 
 You will need permissions to create the directory and link, so just prefix the commands above with sudo if necessary. 
 
 I also had this error, but could only fix it through the suggestion  here . 
 To summarize, use: 
 
 Instead of: 
 
 The reason is that "localhost" is a special name for the MySQL driver making it use the UNIX socket to connect to MySQL instead of the a TCP socket. 
 
 I was having the same problem and this is how I fixed it: 
 I had this and it didn't work: 
 
 I did this and it worked: 
 
 Instead of using the mysql server, I connected directly to the Unix Socket. Worked for me. 
 
 MySQL socket is located, in general, in   or  , but probably PHP looks in the wrong place. 
 
 Check where is your socket with: 
 
 When the updatedb is terminated: 
 
 Then locate your php.ini: 
 
 this will output something like: 
 
 Edit your php.ini 
 
 Change the lines: 
 
 where /tmp/mysql.sock is the path to your socket. 
 Save your modifications and exit ESC + SHIFT: x 
 Restart Apache 
 
 
 
 I am on XAMPP on Mac OS X, and  **Brian Lowe's solution above worked with a slight modification**
.  
 The mysql.sock file is actually in "/Applications/xampp/xamppfiles/var/mysql/" folder. So had to link it up both in /tmp and /var/mysql. I haven't checked which one is used by PHP command line, but this did the fix, so I am happy :-) 
 
 
 Mac OS X EL Capitan + MAMP Pro
Do this 
 
 Then do this 
 
 Hope this saves you some time. 
 
 The reason is that php cannot find the correct path of  . 
 Please make sure that your mysql is running first.  
 Then, please confirm that which path is the   located, for example  
 then add this path string to php.ini:  
 
 mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock   
 mysqli.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock 
 pdo_mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock 
 
 Finally, restart Apache. 
 
 When you face the following issue: 
 
 PHP throwing error "Warning: mysql_connect()  http://function.mysql-connect : 2002 No such file or directory (trying to connect via unix:///tmp/mysql.sock)" 
 
 Set "mysql.default_socket" value in your   to 
 
 Then restart web service in server admin  
 
 Fix the looming 2002 socket error – which is linking where MySQL places the socket and where OSX thinks it should be, MySQL puts it in /tmp and OSX looks for it in /var/mysql the socket is a type of file that allows mysql client/server communication.

 Another solution is to fix the socket location in the php.ini configuration file like this: 
 
 Of course, the symlink works too, so its a matter of preference which one you change. 
 
 When you install php53-mysql using port it returns the following message which is the solution to this problem: 
 
 
 i was having the same issue  
 **[PDOException]
SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory**

 **[ErrorException]
Warning: PDO::__construct(): [2002] No such file or directory (trying to connect via unix:///var/mysql/mysql.sock) in …htdocs/Symfony/vendor/doctrine-dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/PDOConnection.php**
  
 So the solution is to make a symlink to the sock file thus resolving the issue. Do the following to resolve it: 
 $ sudo mkdir /private/var/mysql/ 
 $ sudo ln -s /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock /private/var/mysql/mysql.sock

 I got the same errors.
Mysql was running as a standalone application before I started phpMyAdmin. 
 I just stopped mysql
Then
sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp stop
sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp start 
 It worked fine 
 
 I just had this problem, but it only appeared when loading certain pages (other pages worked fine). It turned out that I was making calls to MySQL after I closed the connection with  . So, as @brucenan said:  **make sure that MySQL is running when you call it**
. 
 
 You can do it by simply aliasing the MAMP php on Apple terminal: 
 
 Example:  
 Now you can run something like:  
 Note: This will be applied only for the current terminal session. 
 
 Since your might use MAMP, either change your Port to the default 3306 or use 127.0.0.1 in the database.php 
 
 Or with the default settings: 
 
 
 The mySQL client by default attempts to connect through a local file called a socket instead of connecting to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) for localhost.  
 The default location of this socket file, at least on OSX, is  . 
 QUICK, LESS ELEGANT SOLUTION 
 Create a symlink to fool the OS into finding the correct socket. 
 
 PROPER SOLUTION 
 Change the socket path defined in the   file in  .
