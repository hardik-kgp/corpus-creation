 I'm getting this error above on localhost even if my config file is like this:  
 
 This used to work, but now it doesn't anymore. Is there any problem with this code or is it not working now?  This  is the tutorial I am working on right now. 
 
 That combination of username, host, and password is not allowed to connect to the server. Verify the permission tables (reloading grants if required) on the server and that you're connecting to the correct server. 
 
 If youre running wamp update  
 
 To your machines ip address (mine is 192.168.0.25); 
 
 You can find it on window by typing ipconfig in your console or ifconfig on mac/linux 
 
 mysqli_connect(DB_SERVER,DB_USERNAME,DB_PASSWORD,DB_DATABASE);  
 use DB_HOST instead of DB_SERVER  
 
 Make sure that your password doesn't have special characters and just keep a plain password (for ex: 12345), it will work. This is the strangest thing that I have ever seen. I spent about 2 hours to figure this out. 
 Note: 12345 mentioned below is your plain password 
 
 
 Look at your code 
You defined DB_HOST and querying DB_SERVER. DB_USER and DB_USERNAME
Use this code 
 
 
 you defIne as DB_USER but use as DB_USERNAME. Also php says username@localhost cant access. Not root@localhost.  
 Change your define or connect paramater. 
 
 This is your code: 
 
 The only error that causes this message is that: 
 
 you're defining a   but you're calling after as  . 
 
 Please be more careful next time. 
 It is better for an entry-level programmer that wants to start coding in   not to use what he or she does not know very well.  
 ONLY as advice, please try to use (for the first time) code more ubiquitous. 
 ex: do not use the   statement, try to use variables declaration as  
 Have a nice experience :) 
 
 The question has been answered above, Just to make you feel comfortable using all four string at the same time in a connection 
 
 
 The same issue faced me with XAMPP 7 and opencart Arabic 3. 
Replacing  localhost by the actual machine name reslove the issue. 
 
 I have fixed a few things here, the "DB_HOST" defined here should be also DB_HOST down there, and the "DB_USER" is called "DB_USER" down there too, check the code always that those are the same. 
 
 
 There is a typo error in define arguments, change  **DB_HOST**
 into  **DB_SERVER**
 and  **DB_USER**
 into  **DB_USERNAME**
: 
 
 
 Same problem occurd with me, with AWS RDS MySQL. Just now,  answered  similar  question  here. Looked various sources, but as of this thread, almost all lack of answer.
While this thread helped me, tweak in mind to update hostnames at server. Access your SSH and follow the steps: 
 
 **Now, Appending here your hostnames:**
 For example: 
 
 and now, configuring   as follows: 
 
 where   is your  IPv4 Public IP , located at   IP('35.150.12.345') there. 
 **Note: Please note that only IPV4 will work at 'hostname' option. hostname, cname, domains will output database connection error.**

 
 I had this error trying to connect with a different user than   I'd set up to limit access. 
 In mysql I'd set up user   with host   and it wouldn't connect. 
 When I changed the user's host to  , as in 'MofX'@'127.0.0.1', it worked. 
 
 In my case the problem was: 
 
 (the odd single ' before the double ") 
 
 **Use this**
  
After setup this you will not receive this issue again
 
 
 I was stuck up in this issue after used this query everything was solved 
 
 Do you have two connections at the same time? If so, close every time you don't need it. 
 
 
 than it working fine ! 
 
 try  
 
 and those are warnings 
try  
 
 But i will recommend you to set a root password 
 
 Try changing:  
 
 to this:
