 You are mixing   and   function. 
 If your are using mysql function then instead   use 
 
 If your using mysqli_* function then you have to include your connection to database into  **mysqli_real_escape function**
 : 
 
 Note : Use mysqli_* function since mysql has been deprecated. For information please read  **mysqli_**
*****

 
 From the  documentation  , the function   has two parameters. 
 
 The first one is a  link  for a mysqli instance (database connection object), the second one is the  string  to escape. So your code should be like : 
 
 
 **mysqli_real_escape_string function**
 requires the connection to your database. 
 
 **P.S.:**
 Do not mix  **mysql_**
** functions***
 and  **mysqli_**
** functions***
. Please use   because mysql_* functions are deprecated and will be removed in the future. 
 
 you are mixing   and  
 use this   like 
 
 **NOTE :**
   is deprecated use   or  
 
 If you use the procedural style, you have to provide both a connection and a string: 
 
 Only the object oriented version can be done with just a string: 
 
 The  documentation  should hopefully make this clear. 
 
 pass   as your first parameter in   for this first make connection then do rest.read here  http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.real-escape-string.php 
 
 Use this way instead of your way.  
 
 
 There is slight change in mysql_real_escape_string mysqli_real_escape_string. below syntax 
 mysql_real_escape_string syntax will be  **mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['sample_var'])**

 mysqli_real_escape_string syntax will be  **mysqli_real_escape_string($conn,$_POST['sample_var'])**

 
 The following works perfectly:- 
 
 Now, the  **$connect**
 is my variable containing my connection to the database. You only left out the connection  variable. Include it and it shall work perfectly.  
 
 Replace your query with the following:   
 
 
 use   instead of  
 like so:
