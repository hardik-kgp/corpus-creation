 When I write on the terminal   I got following error  
 
 (node:3500) DeprecationWarning: current Server Discovery and Monitoring engine is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. To use the new Server Discover and Monitoring engine, pass option { useUnifiedTopology: true } to MongoClient.connect.
  Connected MongoDB: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
  Database: game-of-thrones 
 
 The database is connected, but how can I get rid out from the warning

 For details about the   option added in 3.2.1, see  https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.2.1 
 
 My advice is to leave it as it is (maybe place a warning). The   option does not work correctly.  
 More precisely, in the event of a loss of connection to the DBMS, it will never be restored. Current version 3.3.3 does not solve this problem. 
 Check this 
 
 I got the same error and resolved using the below template. 
 
 This worked for me. and now it's not showing any DepricationWarning. 
 
 A little bit update can remove the error while connecting with  **MongoDB**
 native driver
