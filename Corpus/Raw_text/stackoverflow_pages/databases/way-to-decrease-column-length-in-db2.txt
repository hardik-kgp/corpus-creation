 Is there a way to decrease the column length in DB2?  
 Say I have a table temp with column   defined as  . I want to reduce it to  . 
 
 In DB2 9.7 for Linux/UNIX/Windows, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement to reduce the length of a column,  assuming that no values in the column exceed the new column size : 
 
 If any values in the column exceed the desired size you must handle that first. 
 In previous versions of DB2 for Linux/UNIX/Windows, you could not utilize this method to reduce the size of the column.  You either had to drop/recreate the table, or go through a process of adding a column, copying data, and removing the old column.   
 
 As an addition to Ian's answer and  Clockwork-Muse's remark :  
 While it is possible, as Ian pointed out, to use   statements to reduce column length in DB for LUW, this is not the case in DB2 for z/OS as of version 10. 
 According to  this table , only data type changes from   to   are supported, which is a bummer. 
 
 You cannot reduce the length of a column. To achieve this affect you should  
 
 create a new table with your data and with the attribute that you want.  
 Delete old table 
 Rename the new table 
 
 If you want to increase the length, it is possible with   command
