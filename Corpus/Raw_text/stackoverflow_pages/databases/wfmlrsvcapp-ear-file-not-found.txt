*** wfmlrsvcapp-ear-file-not-found ***

 I am trying to install Oracle 11g in my laptop. Im downloading the setup files from here: 
 
 I have downloaded   and  .  
 I have put them in the same folder and started the setup file from the   folder. I go until certain steps and finally during installation i get  **WFMLRSVCApp.ear**
 file not found popup.  
 I googled and i see some solutions where   file should be unzipped to same folder and then start setup. I did the same couple of times but still im getting the same error. Any anyone guess what is missing? 
 
 extract win64_11gR2_database_1of2.zip into win64_11gR2_database_1of2 folder first.  
 Then extract win64_11gR2_database_2of2.zip into win64_11gR2_database_2of2 folder.  
 copy all 4 files in database/ stage/ components folder in win64_11gR2_database_2of2 folder(unziped) & paste them (no replacement) in database/ stage/ components folder in win64_11gR2_database_1of2 (unziped).  
 Then run the setup again. I experienced in it. It works.. 
 
 What you have to do is copy what is inside components folder ( i think four files )  in win64_11gR2_database_2of2.zip and paste it inside the win64_11gR2_database_1of2.zip  components folder and re run the setup . it works  
 
 If you are installing the  , you might receive the   file missing during Installation error during the database installation.  
 **The way to resolve this error is:**

 Make sure you downloaded two disk

 **win64_11gR2_database_2of2.zip**

 
 **Steps:**

 You can see the following folders and files under  **database\stage**

 folder.

 That's it, now you can start by clicking   under  **database**
 folder. 
 
 Hope it helps to understand easily.!!  
 
 I had the same problem but it's an easy one to solve: Download WinMerge and use it to merge the 2 folders that come out of the zip file from Oracle. That will do it.
