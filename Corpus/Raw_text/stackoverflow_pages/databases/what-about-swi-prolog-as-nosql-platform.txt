*** what-about-swi-prolog-as-nosql-platform ***

 I'd like to see (SWI)Prolog advertised as a NoSQL 'serious contender'. 
 (SWI)Prolog has awesome data bindings features, and lot of power - of course - to write logic against such big data. 
 With recent PLGI contribution, writing a sophisticated Gnome GUI has become really easy... What features are most expected from NoSQL fellows ? How does reactive CRUD of RDF sounds ? 
 I have already tested PLGI running several Gnome interfaces - standard like GtkClutter, or self written like graph_gtk (a graph editor, I'm porting this from  graph-gtk , while learning native GIntrospection and GObject/GtkWidgets basics... I think I'm ready to bind Gtk - or generally GObjects - in a declarative way).
