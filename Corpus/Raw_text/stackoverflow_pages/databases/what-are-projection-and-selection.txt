*** what-are-projection-and-selection ***

 What is the difference between projection and selection? Is it: 
 
 Projection --> for selecting the columns of table; and 
 Selection ---> to select the rows of table? 
 
 So are projection and selection vertical and horizontal slicing respectively? 
 
 Exactly. 
 **Projection**
 means choosing   **which columns**
 (or expressions) the query shall return. 
 **Selection**
 means  **which rows**
 are to be returned. 
 if the query is  
 
 then "a, b, c" is the projection part, "where x=3" the selection part. 
 
 Simply  PROJECTION  deals with elimination or selection of columns, while   SELECTION   deals with elimination or selection of rows. 
 
 **Projection:**
 what ever typed in select clause i.e, 'column list' or '*' or 'expressions' that becomes under projection. 
 * selection: *what type of conditions we are applying on that columns i.e, getting the records that comes under selection. 
 For example: 
 
 in the above query the columns "empno,ename,dno,job" those comes under projection, "where job='clerk'" comes under selection 
 
 Projections and Selections are two unary operations in Relational Algebra and has practical applications in RDBMS (relational database management systems). 
 In practical sense, yes Projection means selecting specific columns (attributes) from a table and Selection means filtering rows (tuples). Also, for a conventional table, Projection and Selection can be termed as vertical and horizontal slicing or filtering.
