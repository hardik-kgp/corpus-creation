 What's your favorite open source database design/modeling tool? 
 I'm looking for one that supports several databases, especially Firebird SQL but I can't find one on Google. 
 
 I've used  DBDesigner  before.  It is an open source tool.  You might check that out.  Not sure if it fits your needs. 
 Best of luck! 
 
 Do you mean design as in 'graphic representation of tables' or just plain old 'engineering kind of design'. If it's the latter, use  FlameRobin , version 0.9.0 has just been released. 
 If it's the former, then use  DBDesigner . Yup, that uses Java. 
 Or maybe you meant something more like MS Access. Then  Kexi  should be right for you. 
 
 S.Lott inserted a comment, but it should be an answer: see  the same question . 
 **EDIT**

 Since it wasn't as obvious as I intended it to be, here follows a verbatim copy of S.Lott's answer in the other question: 
 
 I'm a big fan of  ARGO UML  from Tigris.org.  Draws nice pictures
  using standard UML notation.  It does some code generation, but mostly
  Java classes, which isn't SQL DDL, so that may not be close enough to
  what you want to do. 
 You can look at the  Data Modelling Tools  list and see if anything
  there is better than Argo UML.  Many of the items on this list are
  free or cheap. 
 Also, if you're using  Eclipse  or  NetBeans , there are many
  design plug-ins, some of which may have the features you're looking
  for. 
 
 
 The  DB Designer Fork  project claims that it can generate FireBird sql scripts. 
 
 I like  Clay  Eclipse plugin. I've only used it with MySQL, but it claims Firebird support. 
 
 You may want to look at  IBExpert Personal Edition .  While not open source, this is a very good tool for designing, building, and administering Firebird and InterBase databases. 
 The Personal Edition is free, but some of the more advanced features are not available.  Still, even without the slick extras, the free version is very powerful.
