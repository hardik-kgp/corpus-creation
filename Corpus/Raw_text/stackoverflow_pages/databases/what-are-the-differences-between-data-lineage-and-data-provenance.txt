*** what-are-the-differences-between-data-lineage-and-data-provenance ***

 From wiki, 
 Data lineage is defined as a data life cycle that includes the data's origins and where it moves over time. It describes what happens to data as it goes through diverse processes. It helps provide visibility into the analytics pipeline and simplifies tracing errors back to their sources. 
 Data provenance documents the inputs, entities, systems, and processes that influence data of interest, in effect providing a historical record of the data and its origins. 
 It seems that both concepts are talking about about where the data comes from but I'm still confused about the differences. Are both the concepts the same? If they are different, can someone shares an example? 
 Thanks, 
 
 From our experience,  **data provenance**
 includes only high level view of the system for business users, so they can roughly navigate where their data come from. It's provided by variety of modeling tools or just simple custom tables and charts.  **Data lineage**
 is a more specific term and includes two sides - business (data) lineage and technical (data) lineage. Business lineage pictures data flows on a business-term level and it's provided by solutions like Collibra, Alation and many others. Technical data lineage is created from actual technical metadata and tracks data flows on the lowest level - actual tables, scripts and statements. Technical data lineage is being provided by solutions such as MANTA or Informatica Metadata Manager.  
 
 Data Provenance is, 
 data lineage (what is the genealogy,history of its journey, where did it begin, how did it come into being, how did it change over time, where has it been, systems it has traveled, any loss or gain) (i.e. data oriented, metadata) 
 **PLUS**
  
 the inputs, entities, systems and processes that influenced the data (i.e. process oriented) which can be used to reproduce the data.  
 
 See this section in the Wikipedia articl on provenance:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance#Science . It links to collections of academic and industry work on provenance. 
 To succinctly answer your question:  in general , there's not enough context known to differentiate between  data lineage  and  data provenance . Within a specific context, you could look for, or create, specific and possibly different, definitions. 
 
 Data Provenance is the point of origin  for the data term, Data Lineage is the complete data transformation journey from point of origin to current observation point in system. 
 
 I believe a more simple explanation is who owns it, who touched it, and where is it going. 
 In a Business sense, that can be summed up in Data Flow Diagrams. 
 In a Technical sense, that's a whole lot of baggage to start adding onto data as it flows from system to system. There has to be some HUGE justification to carry that mountain around and for what purpose? To see some pretty graphs? Not going to happen in large real world environments. The justification in $$$ for what?? 
 It's one thing to tag data with a simple 2 - 4 byte code of origin as it moves from system to system, but to keep all of that other technical jumbo, the cost in system performance degradation / dasd / backups / etc. for a pretty graph? No way....
