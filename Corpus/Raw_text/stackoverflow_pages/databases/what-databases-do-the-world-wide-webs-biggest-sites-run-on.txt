 This question is meant to serve as a list of databases and their configurations that the major web sites use and would be a great reference for anyone thinking of scaling their web site to the size of Twitter, Facebook or even Google. 
 Please keep your answers to a minimum and be sure to cite any sources used. 
 EDIT: 
 Also, please  **bold**
 both the web-site name and the database for easier scanning. 
 
 **Facebook.com**

 
 **MySQL with MyRocks**
. Used to store user info and social activities such as likes, comments, and shares. 
 **Hive**
 (Data warehouse for Hadoop, supports tables and a variant of SQL called hiveQL). Used for "simple summarization jobs, business intelligence and machine learning and many other applications" 
 **Cassandra**
 (Multi-dimensional, distributed key-value store). Currently used for Facebook's private messaging. 
 
 Currently running 610 (soon to be 1000) Hadoop nodes in a single cluster with Hive datastore. Both Hive and Cassandra have been open-sourced by Facebook. 
 Facebook stats: 
 
 More than 200 million active users 
 More than 100 million users log on to Facebook at least once each day 
 More than 30 million users update their statuses at least once each day 
 Average user has 120 friends on the site

 **LinkedIn.com**

 
 **Oracle**
 (Relational Database) 
 **MySQL**
 (Relational Database) 
 
 Databases replicated on multiple servers for high availability. Each specific Service uses its own domain-specific DB.

 **Yahoo.com**

 
 **PostgreSQL**
 (modified) - A client can connect to any of the nodes in the cluster (or a policy restricted subset).  A query flows from the client to the server it chose to connect with. The SQL compiler on that node compiles and optimizes the query on that single node (no parallelism).

 **Cassandra**
 (Multi-dimensional, distributed key-value store). Twitter is just "beginning to use Cassandra at Twitter" (see second source). 
 
 In May 2008, Twitter had 1 MySQL instance for writes with multiple MySQL slave instances for reads. 
 Twitter stats: 
 
 Total Users: 1+ million
