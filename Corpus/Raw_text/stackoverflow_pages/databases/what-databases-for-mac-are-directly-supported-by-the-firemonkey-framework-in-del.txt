*** what-databases-for-mac-are-directly-supported-by-the-firemonkey-framework-in-del ***

 Confronted with the task to develop a database application for a company working in a pure Mac environment, what are my options for a central database server to be used by a Delphi FMX application (except the obvious setting up a Windows or Linux box)? 
 
 From  http://www.embarcadero.com/products/firemonkey/more-connected : 
 
 FireMonkey includes built-in component based access to MS SQL Server,
  Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, Sybase, Informix, InterBase and Firebird
  databases. 
 
 Oracle, MySQL and  Firebird  are available for Mac OS X - I did not check the others 
 
 http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Deploying_dbExpress_Database_Applications 
 Only a few is listed in this article, so maybe they are all supported database at this moment. 
 libsqlinf.dylib  
 For applications connecting to Informix databases  
 libsqlora.dylib  
 For applications connecting to Oracle databases  
 libsqlasa.dylib  
 For applications connecting to Adaptive Server Anywhere databases  
 libsqlmys.dylib  
 For applications connecting to MySQL databases  
 libsqlfb.dylib  
 For applications connecting to Firebird databases  
 libsqlib.dylib  
 For applications connecting to Interbase databases  
 libmidas.dylib  
 Required by database applications that use client datasets  
 
 Have a look at  
 **MariaDB**
 (It is a drop in replacement for MySql) and runs on the Mac and windows. 
 To connect to the database 
look at  **Devart**
's  MyDac7.x  it can connect to both MacOs and Windows
