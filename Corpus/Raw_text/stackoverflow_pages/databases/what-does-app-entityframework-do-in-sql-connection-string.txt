*** what-does-app-entityframework-do-in-sql-connection-string ***

 I have 2 connection strings - 1 local and 1 for my main production server. Entity Framework added App=EntityFramework to my local string when I installed it (4.1) - I'm now on 4.3. What does this do - I can't find any reference to it? 
 Here's my local connection string: 
 
 Just curious! 
 
 It's just the synonym of the Application Name. 
 You can see the Connection String properties outlined here:

 App and Application Name are simply a way for somebody debugging SQL Server to know which client is connecting to it. If you had a SQL Server that has several apps that used it, it might be hard to know which one was sending which statements. If each app used a different Application Name it would be very clear.
