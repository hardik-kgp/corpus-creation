*** what-does-eq-ref-and-ref-types-mean-in-mysql-explain ***

 When we prefix an SQL query with the keyword "explain" we get a table with some columns. Please tell me what is the "type" column. What does   and   mean in that context. 
 
 I'll try an explanation...  
 **eq_ref**
 â€“ imagine that you have two tables. Table A with columns (id, text) where id is a primary key. Table B with the same columns (id, text) where id is a primary key. Table A has the following data: 
 
 Table B has the following data: 
 
 Imagine eq_ref as JOIN between A and B: 
 
 This JOIN is very fast because for each row scanned in table A there can be only  **ONE**
 row in table B which satisfies the JOIN condition. One and no more than one. That is because B.id is UNIQUE. Here you are a  pseudo  code which illustrates the processing at server side: 
 
 **ref**
 - Now imagine another table C with columns (id, text) in which id an index but a non UNIQUE one. Table C has the following data: 
 
 Imagine ref as JOIN between A and C: 
 
 Here you are a pseudo code which illustrates the processing at server side: 
 
 This JOIN is NOT as fast as the former one because for each row scanned in table A there are  **SEVERAL**
 possible rows in table C which may satisfy the JOIN condition (no break in the loop above). That is because C.ID is NOT UNIQUE. 
 I hope that helps... 
 Cheerz! 
 
 The "type" refers to the join type made in your request. From best to worst, here is the list : 
 
 system 
 const 
 eq_ref 
 ref 
 range 
 index 
 all
