*** what-does-is-identity-column-property-mean-in-sql-server ***

 I am using  **SQL Server**
 for the first time and I see that a column property is called  **Is Identity**
. 
 What does this mean? 
 What are the advantages of marking a column property as  **Is Identity = Yes**
? 
 
 It simply means the column uses the   function to provide values for a primary key (usually). It is also known as "Autonumber". The second line below is an example: 
 
 It acts as a default value for the column that increments for each record. Note that you can also get the value inserted from SCOPE_IDENTITY(). Do not use @@IDENTITY as it is depreciated and can return the wrong result in the case of triggers or nested contexts. 
 
 Flag indicating an Identity Column - can be used as an auto-increment column (recommended for any table) 
 it has many implications like being able to get the id of the last inserted row in a table using @@IDENTITY or SCOPE_IDENTITY() etc.

 It's equivalent to MySQL's AUTO_INCREMENT property.  Usually used on a primary key column
