*** what-does-mean ***

 I'm trying to trace some SQL in Microsoft Server. I came across a join that is using a convention unfamiliar to me. What does " " mean? 
 
 
 This: 
 
 ...is old TSQL (pre SQL Server 2005) outer join syntax, and is not an ANSI JOIN. 
 Reference:  SQL Server 2005 Outer Join Gotcha 
 
 I believe that is old syntax indicating an outer join condition from table1 to table2 
 Old style: 
 
 New style (SQL92): 
 
 
 This is the old style syntax for expressing joins 
 
 It means the code needs to be replaced immediately! This style join is supposed to be a right join. Unfortunately it will sometimes be interpreted as a cross join, so the results of using this join may not be correct. Also, this syntax is deprecated and cannot be used inteh next version of SQl server.  
 
 That is the ANSI SQL 1989 syntax for RIGHT OUTER JOIN, where *= would be the LEFT OUTER JOIN. 
 You should note also that putting the join syntax in the WHERE clause is deprecated in SQL 2008.  http://scarydba.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/no-join-predicate/  <== A timely article on this. 
 
 This is the old style of joins which were deprecated in ANSI SQL92.  New syntax uses INNER and OUTER JOIN which join tables based on expressions rather than equality 
 
 A ??? outer join is specified using the symbol =* in place of = in the WHERE clause. 
 
 yeap, it's another syntax for a left outer join 
 
from
table1 left outer join table2 on table1.yr = table2.yr - 1
 
 
 
 Means the same thing as this: 
 
 The * syntax is considered outdated , and is not in line with the ANSI standards. 
 Oracle has a similar construct  like this: 
 
 
 To be plain and simple.
This is a SQL-92 outer join operator (  more info  ) 
 Don't use it, its very old school, but its similar to LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.
All its doing is telling which side of the join is the "Parent" side, so rows on that side will be considered first. 
 If you try to run this on SQL 2005, it will throw an error, saying that you need to run this in compatibility mode. 
 
 There are a lot of silly answers here. You didn't give the FROM clause, so there's no way to tell if your *= represents a LEFT or a RIGHT outer join. 
 
 is old syntax for an outer join, for sure. But anyone who claims to know whether it's a LEFT or RIGHT outer join is mistaken. It depends on the order in which table1 and table2 are named in the FROM clause, and that's not given.
