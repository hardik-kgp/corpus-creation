*** what-does-on-update-restrict-do ***

 
 I know from  here  that ON DELETE CASCADE means that if I delete a row from the users table, then the associated row from the user meta table will be removed too. But what does  ON UPDATE RESTRICT do? 
 
  prevents the action from happening if there's any foreign keys that rely on the field that's being changed.
