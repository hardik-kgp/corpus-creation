 As I could not find the answer anywhere else: 
 What is SGBD? Is it "Système de Gestion de Bases de
Données" (Database management system)? 
 E.g. it is used in responses to these
two Stack Overflow questions: 
 
 Trip time calculation in relational databases?   
 How can I use Python for large scale development? 
 
 
 Yes you're right, I confirm that in French we use the abbreviation SGBD for 'Système Gestion de Base de Données' (DataBase Management System / DBMS) to which we can sometimes add R (SGBDR) 'Système Gestion de Base de Données  Relationnelle ' (RDBMS). 
 
 SGBD also applies for Spanish:  Sistema de Gestion de Bases de Datos . 
 
 SGBD = Database System  
 The english acronym is RDBMS (Relational database management system) 
 
 SGBD might also mean "Sistema de Gestão de Banco de Dados" in Portuguese. Literally, "Database Management System", our good old DBMS.  
 
 A SGBD is a "Système de Gestion de Base de Données" which is exactly the same as a DBMS. I can't say much more since there are no great translation subtlety.
