*** what-is-a-bw-tree ***

 I have just read a paper on "in memory OLTP" for the next version of SQL server; it mentions BW-Tree as being added as well as hash indexes in CTP2.     
 So what is a BW-Tree? Can someone explain a bit about it without me (and everyone else) having to read a 12 page research paper. 
 
 From Microsoft: 
 
 Our new form of B tree, called the Bw-tree achieves its very high performance via a latch-free approach that effectively exploits the processor caches of modern multi-core chips. Our storage manager uses a unique form of log structuring that blurs the distinction between a page and a record store and works well with flash storage.

 In a nutshell, a bw-tree is a kind of b-tree that is optimized for in-memory and for high concurrency.
For in-memory: the pages are variable-size and always tightly packed; there are no partially-filled pages
For high-concurrency: the data structure is completely latch- and lock-free to support concurrent DML without blocking.
