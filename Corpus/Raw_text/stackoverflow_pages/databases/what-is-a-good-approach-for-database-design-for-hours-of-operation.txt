*** what-is-a-good-approach-for-database-design-for-hours-of-operation ***

 I am trying to create an application that will need to use hours of operation and allow users to search by it (think how Yelp does this).  
 I am debating what is a good design for this.  The only thing I can think of is having a database table with a foreign key to a "Companies" table that lists a day of the week and the open and close times.  
 
 Is there any other approach that would work and be more efficient? 
 
 Have two tables: 
 **operational_hours**
 (company_id, day_of_week, open_time, close_time) 
 **operational_hours_special**
 (company_id, date, open_time, close_time) 
 You would need to join the two tables to check for the special hours. 
 Will any of your companies be closed for breakfast, lunch, dinner,  siesta ? If so, I would add: 
 **operational_hours_closed**
 (company_id, day_of_week, close_time, open_time) 
 Even more fun  s! 
 
 Your approach seems sound.  Just a few minor things to note: 
 Make sure you index this table on Company_Id and DayOfWeek_Id (and in that order).  It should also (possibly) support multiple entries per day of week, in case the company closes during the day or if it is open overnight.
