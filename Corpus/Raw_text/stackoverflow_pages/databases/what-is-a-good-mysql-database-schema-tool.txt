 I'm starting a new project soon and I'd like to try to use some better tools this time around. The last project, I wrote all my Database creation SQL by hand for MySQL. I'm hoping there are some good tools out there for creating, maintaining and modifying database schema in MySQL. My budget is out-of-my-own-pocket, so free (as in beer) would probably be best. :) 
 
 MySQL Workbench :  http://dev.mysql.com/workbench/ 
 It is free and very easy to use. I usually create schema diagrams and export it as a .sql file to use with phpMyAdmin 
 
 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html  offers a list of GUI tools to use.

 A complete list of data modeling tools can be found at  databaseanwers 
 
 MySQL Workbench 5.1 (Beta 1) should be out March 6,2009. It will be available on MacOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Windows. These are  native  C++ implementations on each platform. WB 5.1 is focused on Data Modeling (replacing Mike Zinnerâ€™s popular DBDesigner product). 
 MySQL Workbench 5.2 (Alpha 1) should be out mid April 2009 (around the MySQL Users Conference 2009). This will include a ground up rewrite of the MySQL Query Browser.

 I know this is an old thread but this is too good to miss out on. I've only just found out about this recently... 
 HeidiSQL   
 It supports connecting through SSH tunnels. It uses PuTTY (plink.exe) to do this but avoids having to manually fiddle with your PuTTY settings. It's even easier if you're using this nice portable version of PuTTY...  http://jakub.kotrla.net/putty/ 
 Plus it's open source. I strongly urge you to donate though as it's a great tool. 
 Another one that looks good is  DBeaver 
 I used to really like MySQL Administrator but the new Workbench is way too bloated. I just want a quick way to browse the schema without having to  
 
 Use DB Schema editor but it is not freeware. But you can trial it for 15 days for free by downloading  here
