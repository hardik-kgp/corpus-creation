 Free Tool to compare Sql Server tables   
 
 I would like to compare two SQL Server databases including schema (table structure) and data in tables too. What is best tool to do this? 
 
 I am using Red-Gate's software:
  http://www.red-gate.com 
 
 I use schema and data comparison functionality built into the latest version  **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015**
 Community Edition (Free) or Professional / Premium /  Ultimate edition. Works like a charm!

 **Red-Gate's SQL data comparison tool**
 is my second alternative:

 I like  Open DBDiff .
Updated  Open DBDiff Link 
 It's not the most complete tool, but it works great and it's free. And it's very easy to use.  
 
 **SQL Admin Studio**
 from  http://www.simego.com/Products/SQL-Admin-Studio  is now free, lets you manage your SQL Database,  **SQL Compare and Synchronise**
,  **Data Compare and Synchronise**
 and much more. Also supports SQL Azure and some MySQL Support too. 
 [UPDATE: Yes I am the Author of the above program, as it's now Free I just wanted to Share it with the community] 
 
 I'm partial to  AdeptSQL .  It's clean and intuitive and it DOESN'T have the one feature that scares the hell out of me on a lot of similar programs.  One giant button that it you push it will automatically synchronize EVERYTHING without so much as a by-your-leave.  If you want to sync the changes you have to do it yourself and I like that. 
 
 There is one tool with source code available at 
 http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/205011/SQL-Server-Database-Comparison-Tool 
 That should give flexibility  as code is available.  
 
 dbghost  is the best i have used to date.  one of the best features i have seen is that it will generate SQL code to go between versions of a database based on the SQL you keep in source control, as well as a database.  simple and easy to use. 
 
 I've used SQL Delta before ( http://www.sqldelta.com/ ), it's really good. Not free however, not sure how prices compare to Red-Gates 
 
 Try DBComparer, it's free and fast: 
 http://dbcomparer.com/ 
 
 Database Workbench can made it too 
 http://www.upscene.com/products.dbw.index.php 
 
 Cross database development 
 Use the Schema Compare and Migration
  Tools to compare testing and deployed
  databases, migrate existing databases
  to different database systems. 
 
 you can also made it with database Comparer 
 http://www.clevercomponents.com/products/dbcomparer/dbcomparer.asp 
 I use it for Firebird and it works well. 
 
 Try  dbForge Data Compare for SQL Server . It can compare and sync any databases, even very large ones. Quick, easy, always delivers a correct result.
Try it on your database and comment upon the product.  
 We can recommend you a reliable SQL comparison tool that offer 3 timeâ€™s faster comparison and synchronization of table data in your SQL Server databases. It's  dbForge Data Compare for SQL Server  and  dbForge Schema Compare for SQL Server 
 Main advantages: 
 
 Speedier comparison and synchronization of large databases 
 Support of native SQL Server backups 
 Custom mapping of tables, columns, and schemas 
 Multiple options to tune your comparison and synchronization 
 Generating comparison and synchronization reports 
 
 Plus free 30-day trial and risk-free purchase with 30-day money back guarantee. 
 
 I've used Red Gate's tools and they are superb.
However, if you can't spend any money you could try  Open DBDiff  to compare schemas. 
 
 We are using an inhouse developed solution that is basicly a procedure with arguments of what you want included in the comparision (SP's, Full SP code, table structure, defaults, indices, triggers.. etc) 
 Depending on your needs and budget, it might be a good way to go for you as well. 
 It is quite easily developed as well, then we just redirect output of procedure to textfiles and do text comparisions between the files. 
 One good thing about it is that its possible to save the output in source control.

 I would definitely go with AdeptSQL if you're using MSSQL. It's the least good looking but the most talented db compare tool amongst the ones I've tried. It can compare both the structure and the data. It tells you which tables exist on one db but does not exist on the other, compares the structure and data of the common ones and it can produce the script to synchronize the two. It's not free but has a 30 day trial (as far as I can remember) 
 
 I tried  OpenDiff Tool  . Great tool that is free and easy to use .
