 What is MySQL equivalent of the   Function in Microsoft Access? Is   a SQL standard? 
 In Access, the   function lets you return a value when a variant is null.  Source 
 The syntax for the   function is: 
 
 
 The   function does what you describe.  It's standard SQL and it should be supported in all SQL databases. 
 The   function is not standard SQL.  Only some brands of databases support this function. 
 
 COALESCE does just what the OP is asking for, as does IFNULL: 
 
 The difference is the COALESCE can search through multiple variables and return the first non-null one: 
 
 each of these will return a 0 (zero) if none of the values have a set value (are null). 
 The IFNULL is (pretty meaninglessly) faster.  There's probably other better things to optimize in your query before bothering with IFNULL vs COALESCE issues.  If you have multiple things to check, use COALESCE.  If you only have a single value to check, use IFNULL. 
 
 You might want to look at   or  . If I recall correctly,   works for MySQL. 
 
 Perhaps Knowing what MS Access NZ() Function actually does would be helpful (prior to answering with completely invalid suggestions). The NZ() Function test for Null and Replaces the Null with an empty string, a Zero or optionally a value that the user enters. 
 COALESCE doesn't even come close, in fact it returns a Null if no none Null values in a 'List???'  
 IFNULL() Function is what you're looking for.

 Have look to the null safe operator <=> 
 Maybe it could help :
