*** what-is-returned-from-mongoose-query-that-finds-no-matches ***

 I'm a little confused reading the Mongoose documentation.  
 If I run a query in mongoose which matches no documents in the collection, what are the values of   and   in the callback function  ? I just don't know what Mongoose considers an "error". As a mathematician, returning the empty set (i.e.   array empty) seems perfectly valid and shouldn't be an "error" - the query executed fine, there was just no matching documents. On the other hand, some may consider it an "error". From mongoose docs, either: 
 
  = null,   = [] 
  = null,   = null 
  = error document,   = null 
 
 
 It depends on the query. If it is a  , then  . If it is a  , then  . No errors if everything else is ok. 
 
 If conditions were valid but no matches were found: 
 
 :   is  ,   is  
  and  :   is  ,   is  
 
 However, if some condition was invalid (e.g. field is   but you pass an  , or you pass an invalid  ) 
 For all three:   is  ,   is
