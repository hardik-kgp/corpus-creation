*** what-is-sequential-flooding ***

 This might be simple, but I can't get my head around it. Can anyone give me an example of sequential flooding? In the textbook I am reading and in Internet sources it is stated 
 
 When the number of buffer frames is less than the pages in file, this will result in reading every page of the file. This is a nasty situation caused by LRU and repeated scans when  
 # frames < # pages in file.  
 Using LRU, every scan of the file will result in reading every page of the file." 
 
 But what exactly is it? Why does it happen? 
 
 Let us say there is   buffer frames   and  ,   pages in file  ,   and  .
What would happen if we scan the file twice(P1, P2, P3, P1, P2, P3) with  ? 
 
 
 
 As you can see, using  , every scan of a page will cost a page miss. However,   will do much better.
