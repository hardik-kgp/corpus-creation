 Which of the following databases is best for a big desktop application: Firebird, JavaDB, hsqldb ?
I need performance, easy of use, and totally free license. 
 
 If you're looking for an embeddable database, my recommendation would be  H2  (stands for Hypersonic 2, (re)written by the author of HSQLDB). See the  detailed comparison of features  and of  performances . 
 Using a 100% Java database would allow to run it in the same process and make things a lot easier IMO. 
 
 Let me recommend you on  **Postgres**
 ( http://www.postgresql.org/ 
), which is one of the best freeware DB's I know.  
 I had an experience with this DB in my previous project, in which we held ~20 tables in the schema, the largest table had ~100,000 rows, and the amount of total data was not that big. 
 This project is running in production for more then 2 years, and there weren't any special problems with it.

 My recommendation is H2. I recently migrated a db (from MS SQL server) including 2 larger tables hosting >2 million rows each. First I tried Derby and had issues (not only performance) - then I switched to H2 and migrated everything successfully. 
 
 I think you'll be better off with an embeddable database for this.  HSQLDB or H2 would work, as would  SQLite .  SQLite is quite popular outside the Java world (it's used by the Mozilla project, for instance).  I'm not familiar with JavaDB, so I can't speak to its capabilities. 
 SQLite is known to be pretty fast. 
 
 Firebird  is very good database especially for desktop application 
 There is good java driver. 
 
 Depends on requirements and data amount. My last choice was MySQL and it was very comfortable (swing app) 
 
 I would go for a DBMS that is  not  Java-specific.  You may want to share your data with a C++ or .NET application some day.  If it does not need to be client/server consider SQLite or H2.  If it does then consider Postgres.  All of these have ODBC drivers and/or drivers for specific languages other than Java.
