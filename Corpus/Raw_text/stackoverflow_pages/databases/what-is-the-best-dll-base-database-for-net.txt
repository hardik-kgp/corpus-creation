*** what-is-the-best-dll-base-database-for-net ***

 I have a Hosting which doesn't support   or any other databse because it is cheap. I know that there are some Dll in which we can add to project and use it as the database. 
 I wantto know that which one is the best? and is there any other solution to use a database in a Hosting which doesn't support any kind of Database? (don't tell that you can usefile-base database, cause I don't like it) 
 
 You could use  SQL Server Compact Edition , or  SqlLite  with a .NET provider (like this one:  System.Data.SQLite ). 
 
 Best might be subjective, but
 Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0  or  Sqlite 
 SQL Server Compact Edition 4 was updated to enable: 
 
 Enabled to work in the medium or partial trust environments in the web servers, and can be easily deployed along with the website to the third party website hosting service providers.  
 
 
 FireBird is also a good choice.
Read more about it. 
 What is a good embedded database to use with C#? 
 
 There is an sql server  compact editon  if you have no access to a data base server.  Also if you host doesn't support databases you can get hosted databases from another provider.  Another very popular DBMSless option is  Sql light  which I have used in c and am sure some one has extended to use in c#. 
 
 I suggest you Db4o (Database for objects):  http://www.db4o.com 
 It's an object-oriented database and it works like a charm since it store objects instead of tables and rows, that may be a good choice for you as it'll free you of creating a data access layer, object-relational mapping and so. 
 Anyway, I'll tell you that if you're going to host data for some multi-user application, any of possible solutions would be a bad choice because you'll have great performance issues. 
 
 I would take  **SQLite**
 over SQL Compact Edition in notime. 
 So, for small apps, I always go with SQLite. 
 You have a good (maybe the best) library for C#  here  as well, you can use a small app to view the database using  SQLite Admin

 I'm using   and happy with it. It works greatly even in cheapest shared web hostings.
