 I tried to look for benchmark on the performances of various filesystems with MySQL InnoDB but couldn't find any. 
 My database workload is the typical web-based OLTP, about 90% read, 10% write. Random IO.  
 Among popular filesystems such as ext3, ext4, xfs, jfs, Reiserfs, Reiser4, etc. which one do you think is the best for MySQL? 
 
 You should have a look at  Lessons Learned in Building a Highly Scalable MySQL Database .
They benchmarked mysql with some of these filesystems and jfs looks like a clear the winner. 
 
 If you are working with  InnoDB  this  two part interaction at the mysqlperformanceblog  with  Heikki Tuuri  who created it should good reading.
