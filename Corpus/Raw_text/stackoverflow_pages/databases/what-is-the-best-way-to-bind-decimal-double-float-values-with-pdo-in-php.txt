*** what-is-the-best-way-to-bind-decimal-double-float-values-with-pdo-in-php ***

 It appears the class constants only cover  ,   and   for binding. Do you just bind decimal / float / double values as strings or is there a better way to treat them? 
 MySQLi allows the 'd' type for double, it's surprising that PDO doesn't have an equivalent when it seems better in so many other ways. 
 
 AFAIK PDO::PARAM_STR is the way to go. 
 
 You have to use PDO::PARAM_STR, but for SQLite and other engines this can have unpredictable behaviors.  See this issue for one example:  SQLite HAVING comparison error 
 
 If you really want to use PDO you'll have to enter it as an  , but I never use a specification for  . 
 It is an optional parameter to specify the   type. 
 I guess you would better not set the   type for  s.
