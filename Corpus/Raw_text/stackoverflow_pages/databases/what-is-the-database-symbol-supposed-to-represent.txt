*** what-is-the-database-symbol-supposed-to-represent ***

 I know this isn't exactly a technical question, but I have never understood what is meant by the database symbol as a stack of nickles. I have a feeling this same question is going to be asked by future generations about the symbol for save being a floppy disk. 
 
 It's an ancient storage mechanism called a disk, or more specifically a  disk pack . The nickels are the various platters. Or it might be an even more ancient one, called a  drum . 
 One of the nastiest sounds I've ever heard was when a computer operator (remember them, anyone?) put the protective cover on a DEC-10 removable disk pack before it had stopped rotating. But the best bit of operations centre madness I've seen was when my then boss walked into the computer room smoking a pipe. The fire system immediately went off - sirens and annunciators going "Danger, danger - Halon release in 30 seconds", "Danger, danger - halon release in 20 seconds" and so on. Someone had thoughtfully positioned  a  new cabinet in front of the halon abort button, so we had a few stressful moments there. Nothing to do with the question, I suppose, but it brought these memories flooding back.... 
 
 It's a stack of  Hard drive platters . 
 
 You probably mean the stacked hard disk platters. This is the physical support for the database.
