*** what-is-the-datatype-for-a-password-in-postgresql ***

 I  read  that there are datatypes which do encryption so passwords are secured in your database. 
 I use at the moment   to store passwords. I have had the idea that I should somehow apply a SHA-512 function to the password and put that data somewhere such that the plain text password is removed. 
 However, the datatype in Perl suggests me that there are a better way in PostgreSQL than varchar. 
 **What is the datatype for a password in PostgreSQL?**

 
 Jeff has a good article titled  You're Probably Storing Passwords Incorrectly . This article discusses various ways of storing passwords in databases, and some of the common pitfalls that you may run into. In particular, it discusses the use of hashing algorithms, rainbow tables, and the use of "salt" to reduce the risk of a compromised password file. 
 The use of the   data type is perfectly suitable for storing a properly hashed password. For example, here is part of my actual account record from a production database: 
 => select account_id, email, salt, passhash from account where email = 'greg@hewgill.com';
 account_id |      email       |       salt       |                 passhash                 
------------+------------------+------------------+------------------------------------------
          1 | greg@hewgill.com | GFR9uT4N4Tzl3vnK | 2c2bf00079a6d49a8f7fb17cefb52fdb41a4b043
(1 row)
 
 In this case,   is the hex representation of the SHA-1 of the salt concatenated with my password. 
 
 Install "chkpass module"  
 This module implements a data type chkpass that is designed for storing encrypted passwords.
You need to install the postgresql contrib package and run CREATE EXTENSION command to install . 
 In Ubuntu 12.04 it would go like this: 
 
 Restart the postgresql server: 
 
 All available extension are in: 
 
 Now you can run the CREATE EXTENSION command. 
 Example: 
 
 Returns 
 
 
 Postgres version 9.4+ can get this done in a smarter and securer way using pgcrypto extension as explained at:  http://www.meetspaceapp.com/2016/04/12/passwords-postgresql-pgcrypto.html
