 What is the difference in between  
 
 and  
 
 as they both seem to  **assign the value**
 ? 
 
 Both of them are  **assignment operators**
 but one thing I can find their differences is that   can be used to perform boolean operation while   cannot. 
 **valid**
: SUM(val = 0) 
Invalid: SUM(val := 0) 
 FROM User-Defined Variables 
 One more thing,  You can also assign a value to a user variable in statements other than SET. In this case, the assignment operator must be := and not = because the latter is treated as the comparison operator = in non-SET statements. 
 
 
 It's more or less Syntactic sugar. 
 Take a look  here 
 Most important difference is 
 
 Unlike =, the := operator is never interpreted as a comparison
  operator. This means you can use := in any valid SQL statement (not
  just in SET statements) to assign a value to a variable. 
 
 
 You can only use := for assignment - never for comparison. It's just a bit of syntactic sugar, it doesn't really change the functionality at all. You'll see it a lot in generated SQL from code.
