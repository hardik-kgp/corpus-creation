*** what-is-the-difference-between-c-and-posix-locales-on-postgres ***

 I know that database locales on Postgres are responsible for proper order of national characters, proper lower/upper-casing etc. 
 But why there are two language-neutral locales:   and  ? Is there any difference between them or is it just one neutral locale with two different names? 
 **UPDATE**
 As Magnus Hagander states in his answer, POSIX and C locales are the same locale with different names (no matter if Postgres is installed on POSIX or Windows System). I don't know how to confirm this information -  **where to look for proper section of documentation?**

 Magnus's explanation seems sensible, but it is strange at the same time that there are two names for the same locale to choose from.  **What is the purpose of this - only to make confusion?**

 
 Note that PostgreSQL just uses the operating system locale, and doesn't have it's own definition of locales. If your system is POSIX compliant, C and POSIX will be the exact same locale:  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap07.html  (see the first sentence under 7.2). 
 
 According to  The Single UNIX Â® Specification  POSIX and C locales are aliases: 
 
 The strings "C" and "POSIX" are reserved as identifiers for the POSIX locale 
 
 So they are guaranteed to be the same on POSIX systems. I don't know how far Windows Vista or 7 are POSIX compliant, but probably similar definition can be found in Microsoft documentation.
