I am a beginner, while he is an expert.
This suggests me that there is something which I do not know. 
 **What is the difference between CHARACTER VARYING and VARCHAR in PostgreSQL?**

 
 Varying is an alias for varchar, so no difference, see  documentation  :) 
 
 The notations varchar(n) and char(n)
  are aliases for character varying(n)
  and character(n), respectively.
  character without length specifier is
  equivalent to character(1). If
  character varying is used without
  length specifier, the type accepts
  strings of any size. The latter is a
  PostgreSQL extension. 
 
 
 The  PostgreSQL documentation on Character Types  is a good reference for this. They are two different names for the same type. 
 
 The only difference is that CHARACTER VARYING is more human friendly than VARCHAR 
 
 Both are the same thing but many of the databases are not providing the varying char mainly postgreSQL is providing. So for the multi database like Oracle Postgre and DB2 it is good to use the Varchar 
 
 The short answer: there is no difference. 
 The long answer:   is the official type name from the ANSI SQL standard, which all compliant databases are required to support.   is a shorter alias which all modern databases also support. I prefer   because it's shorter and because the longer name feels pedantic. However, postgres tools like   and   will output  .
