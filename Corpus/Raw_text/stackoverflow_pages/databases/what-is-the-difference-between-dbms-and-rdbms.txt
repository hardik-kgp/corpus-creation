*** what-is-the-difference-between-dbms-and-rdbms ***

 After reading some answers on different websites I am confused now. So, it would be helpful to mention the key difference between DBMS and RDBMS and any relation between them. 
 
 Since this question become popular on Stack Overflow, I am posting an answer which answers this question for me. I found this answer on  udemy website . Hope this will help future users and newbies searching for a good answer on this topic. 
 
 **Key Difference between DBMS and RDBMS**
**:**

 **The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data in a tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files**
.    
 Does that mean there are no tables in a DBMS?    
 There can be, but there will be no “relation” between the tables , like in a RDBMS. In DBMS, data is generally stored in either a hierarchical form or a navigational form. This means that a single data unit will have one parent node and zero, one or more children nodes. It may even be stored in a graph form, which can be seen in the network model. 
 In a RDBMS, the tables will have an identifier called primary key. Data values will be stored in the form of tables. The relationships between these data values will be stored in the form of a table as well.  Every value stored in the relational database is accessible. This value can be updated by the system. The data in this system is also physically and logically independent. 
 **You can say that a RDBMS is an extension of a DBMS**
, even if there are many differences between the two. Most software products in the market today are both DBMS and RDBMS compliant. Essentially, they can maintain databases in a (relational) tabular form as well as a file form, or both. This means that today a RDBMS application is a DBMS application, and vice versa. However, there are still major differences between a relational database system for storing data and a plain database system.  
 
 Every RDBMS is a DBMS, but the opposite is not true: RDBMS is a DBMS which is based on the  relational model , but not every DBMS must be relational. 
 However, since RDBMS are most common, sometimes the term DBMS is used to denote a DBMS which is NOT relational. It depends on the context. 
 
 DBMS : Data Base Management System 
..... for storage of data and efficient retrieval of data. 
Eg: Foxpro  
 1)A DBMS has to be persistent (it should be accessible when 
the program created the data donot exist or even the 
application that created the data restarted).  
 2) DBMS has to provide some uniform methods independent of a 
specific application for accessing the information that is 
stored.  
 3)DBMS does not impose any constraints or security with 
regard to data manipulation. It is user or the programmer 
responsibility to ensure the ACID PROPERTY of the database  
 4)In DBMS Normalization process will not be present  
 5)In dbms no relationship concept  
 6)It supports Single User only  
 7)It treats Data as Files internally  
 8)It supports 3 rules of E.F.CODD out off 12 rules  
 9)It requires low Software and Hardware Requirements.  
 FoxPro, IMS are Examples  
 RDBMS: Relational Data Base Management System  
 .....the database which is used by relations(tables) to 
acquire information retrieval 
Eg: oracle, SQL..,  
 1)RDBMS is based on relational model, in which data is 
represented in the form of relations, with enforced 
relationships between the tables.  
 2)RDBMS defines the integrity constraint for the purpose of 
holding ACID PROPERTY.  
 3)In RDBMS, normalization process will be present to check 
the database table cosistency  
 4)RDBMS helps in recovery of the database in case of loss of 
data  
 5)It is used to establish the relationship concept between two database objects, i.e, tables  
 6)It supports multiple users  
 7)It treats data as Tables internally  
 8)It supports minimum 6 rules of E.F.CODD  
 9)It requires High software and hardware 
 
 DBMS is the software program that is used to manage all the database that are stored on the network or system hard disk. whereas RDBMS is the database system in which the relationship among different tables are maintained.  
 
 From Wikipedia, 
 
 A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.  
 
 There are different types of DBMS products:  . The most widely commonly used type of DBMS today is the Relational Database Management Systems ( ) 
 **DBMS:**

 
 A DBMS is a storage area that persist the data in files. 
 There are limitations to store records in a single database file.  
 DBMS allows the relations to be established between 2 files. 
 Data is stored in flat files with metadata. 
 DBMS does not support client / server architecture. 
 DBMS does not follow normalization. Only single user can access the data. 
 DBMS does not impose integrity constraints. 
 ACID properties of database must be implemented by the user or the developer 
 
 **RDBMS:**

 
 RDBMS stores the data in tabular form. 
 It has additional condition for supporting tabular structure or data that enforces relationships among tables. 
 RDBMS supports client/server architecture. 
 RDBMS follows normalization. 
 RDBMS allows simultaneous access of users to data tables. 
 RDBMS imposes integrity constraints. 
 ACID properties of the database are defined in the integrity constraints. 
 
 Have a look at this  article  for more details. 
 
 A DBMS is used for storage of data in files. In DBMS relationships can be established between two files. Data is stored in flat files with metadata whereas RDBMS stores the data in tabular form with additional condition of data that enforces relationships among the tables. Unlike RDBMS, DBMS does not support client server architecture. RDBMS imposes integrity constraints and also follows normalization which is not supported in DBMS.  
 
 **DBMS:**
 is a software system that allows Defining, Creation, Querying, Update, and Administration of data stored in data files. 
 Features: 
 
 Normal book keeping system, Flat files, MS Excel, FoxPRO, XML, etc. 
 Less or No provision for: Constraints, Security, ACID rules, users, etc. 
 
 **RDBMS:**
 is a DBMS that is based on Relational model that stores data in tabular form. 
 
 SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle, MySQL, IBM DB2, MS Access, etc. 
 
 Features: 
 
 Database, with Tables having relations maintained by FK 
 DDL, DML 
 Data Integrity & ACID rules 
 Multiple User Access 
 Backup & Restore 
 Database Administration 
 
 
 There are other database systems, such as document stores, key value stores, columnar stores, object oriented databases. These are databases too but they are not based on relations (relational theory) ie they are not relational database systems. 
 So there are lot of differences. Database management system is the name for all databases. 
 
 DBMS stands for "Database Management Systems" it includes all Databases. RDBMS are a special Type of DMBS . R in RDBMS implies that the database uses the Relational model. a collection of related tables in the relational model makes up a database.DBMS is used for simple and small application while RDBMS is used for applications with a huge database.DBMS are for smaller organizations where security is not concerned(i.e. DBMS does not impose any constraints) while RDBMS is quitely opposite( RDBMS define the integrity constraint for the purpose of holding ACID PROPERTY).
