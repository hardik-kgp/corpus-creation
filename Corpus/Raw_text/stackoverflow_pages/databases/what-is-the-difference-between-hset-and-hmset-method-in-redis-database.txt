*** what-is-the-difference-between-hset-and-hmset-method-in-redis-database ***

 In my application im using redis database.I have gone through their documentation but i couldn't find the difference between HSET and HMSET. 
 
 HSET used to be able to set only one key-value pair. And if you needed to set several at once, you would have to use HMSET (M for multi). That was changed a few years ago, to allow both commands to accept multiple pairs. And now HMSET is redundant. 
 From  official documentation : 
 
 As per Redis 4.0.0, HMSET is considered deprecated. Please use HSET in new code. 
 
 
 **HSET key field value**
**:**
  
 Sets field in the hash stored at key to value. If key does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created. If field already exists in the hash, it is overwritten. 
 **HMSET key field value [field value ...]**
  
 Sets the specified fields to their respective values in the hash stored at key. This command overwrites any existing fields in the hash. If key does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.

 The only difference between the commands   and   is the  **return value**
 of the commands.  
 HSET return value (Integer reply):  
 
  if the field is a new field in the hash and value was set. (where   is the number of new fields created ) 
 0 if the field already exists in the hash and the value was updated. 
 
 HMSET returns a simple string as a reply.
