 What is the difference between   and   in mongoose? Which is better for referencing? 
 
 From the  documentation : 
 
 Mongoose assigns each of your schemas an id virtual getter by default
  which returns the documents _id field cast to a string, or in the case
  of ObjectIds, its hexString. 
 
 So, basically, the   getter returns a string representation of the document's   (which is added to all MongoDB documents by default and have a default type of  ). 
 Regarding what's better for referencing, that depends entirely on the context (i.e., do you want an   or a  ). For example, if comparing  's, the string is probably better, as  's won't pass an equality test unless they are the same instance (regardless of what value they represent).
