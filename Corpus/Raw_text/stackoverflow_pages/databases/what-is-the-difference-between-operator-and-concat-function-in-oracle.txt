*** what-is-the-difference-between-operator-and-concat-function-in-oracle ***

 Would it be possible to explain the difference between the   function and the   operator in Oracle?  
 Which one is better in terms of performance? 
 
 There is no functional difference. 
  is the ANSI standard string concatenation operator (though, unfortunately, not every database   chooses to support the standard).  Many databases support a   function so it may be easier to port code using   to different databases. 
 
 'concat' function can be operated only on 2 variables or columns, while 'concat' operation can be done for any number of variables or columns.
