*** what-is-the-difference-between-primary-key-and-prime-attribute ***

 Is there any difference between primary key (which is a composite key) and a prime attribute? 
 
 **A candidate key**
 is a key that uniquely identifies rows in a table. Any of the identified candidate keys can be used as the table's primary key. 
Candidate keys that are not part of the primary key are called  **alternate keys**
. One can describe a candidate key as  **a super key**
 that contains only the minimum number of columns necessary to determine uniqueness.  
 **Prime attributes**
 are the attributes of the candidate key which defines the uniqueness (Eg: SSN number in an employee database) 
 **A primary key**
 is a column in a table whose values uniquely identify the rows in the table. The primary key is chosen from this list of candidates based on its perceived value to the business as an identifier. 
 A primary key value:  
 
 Must uniquely identify the row;  
 cannot have NULL values; 
 Should not change over the time;  
 and Should be as short as possible. 
 
 If the primary key is a combination of more than one column then it is called as  **composite key**
. 
 
 Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in combination.
For example  
 
 The login would be the primary key and the attribute will be the catlover/doglover everything that is attributed in that key 
 
 Student_table {IndexNo,Name,ExamNo,Age,Class,City} 
 
 {IndexNo},{Name,ExamNo} are the candidates keys. From them I'ill choose {IndexNo} as the Primary Key.Those all indexNo,Name,ExamNo are prime attributes 
 
 Employee_table {ID,Name,MobileNo,Age,Height} 
 
 {ID},{MobileNo} are the candidates keys. From them I'ill choose {ID} as the Primary Key.Those all ID,MobileNo attributes are prime attributes 
 
 Lets Look at the definitions. (Attributes mean columns) 
 **Candidate key**
 - Attributes or combination of attributes that can used to uniquely identify table records. 
 **Prime key**
 - Attribute that forms candidate keys. 
 **Primary Key**
 - A attribute from candidate keys, Than used to Uniquely identify the 
 table records.It should Unique, Not Null, Should not update frequently.
