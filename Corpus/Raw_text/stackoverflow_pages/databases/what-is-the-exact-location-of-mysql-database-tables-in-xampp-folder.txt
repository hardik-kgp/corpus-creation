*** what-is-the-exact-location-of-mysql-database-tables-in-xampp-folder ***

 I have a MySQL database and I want to know the exact location where this data actually stored in the XAMPP folder, I went to this file location to try to get the information: 
 
 Here I found a separate folder for each of my databases and within these folders I saw files stored with the  . 
 When I copied my desired database with all tables in   and try to use them on another PC, I was given an empty database of the same name. 
 Where are the data files for the database kept on the local server? 
 
 I think the matter is your tables engine. I guess you are using InnoDB for your table. So you can not copy files easily to make a copy. 
Take a look at these links:

 Also I recommend you to use something like phpMyAdmin for creating your backup file and then restore the backup file on the next machine using the same IDE. 
 
 For Mac, your database files are located at:  
 
 You might need admin permissions to access or delete your files. 
 
 Your database is in this directory: 
 
 
 Rather late I know, but you can use   to get the information. 
 Happy file huntin' SO community :) 
 
 The exact location is stored in " **my.ini**
" which exists under main mysql installation directory. In my.ini file, look for 'datadir'. This parameter points the data folder.  
 
 Data are store in this path. You can search data location, just put the below address in your search location (url address): 
 
 
 Well, here's what worked for me: 
Copy and paste the entire data folder, not just the content. 
I use xampp, and the path to the data is  . 
 Goodluck! 
 
 Just in case you forgot or avoided to copy through PHPMYADMIN export feature..  
 Procedure: You can manually copy: Procedure For MAC OS, for latest versions of XAMPP 
 Location : Find the database folders here /Users/XXXXUSER/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql.. 
 Solution: Copy the entire folder with database names into your new xampp in similar folder. 
 Hope it helps, happy coding. 
 
 If you are like me, and manually installed your webserver without using Xampp or some other installer, 
 Your data is probably stored at
