*** what-is-the-mysql-equivalent-of-postgresqls-explain-analyze ***

 I'd like to get a detailed query plan in MySQL similar to EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows in PostgreSQL. Is there an equivalent? 
 
 EDIT: While not a direct equivalent or as detailed as Explain Analyze here are some tools that you can look at 
 mysql offers EXPLAIN and procedure analyse()

 I have not used PostgreSQL before MySQL has   which gives more information than   and may give you the information you are looking for. 
 
 
 MariaDB/MySQL provide something called  . However there is no substitute for  .   provides no timing information whatsoever, and the internal break down is far less verbose. 
 
 For instance this is  taken from this example , 
 
 Will produce something like this on PostgreSQL, 
 
 While this is the MySQL equivalent, 
 
 
 just for clarity, comment on accepted answer (don't have enough karma to add comment) 
 procedure analyse() is for a different purpose that EXPLAIN,
it analyzes the data set of specified column and suggests the best data type,
i.e. it's useful when we have 1000 rows of varchar(255) and want to check how much length do we really need, f.e. it might tell that varchar(23) would suffice 
 
 MySQL 8.0.18 introduces natively  EXPLAIN ANALYZE : 
 
 **MySQL 8.0.18 introduces EXPLAIN ANALYZE**
, which runs a query and produces EXPLAIN output along with timing and additional, iterator-based information about how the optimizer's expectations matched the actual execution. For each iterator, the following information is provided: 
 
 Estimated execution cost 
 Estimated number of returned rows 
 Time to return first row 
 Time to return all rows (actual cost) 
 Number of rows returned by the iterator 
 Number of loops 
 EXPLAIN ANALYZE can be used only with SELECT statements.
