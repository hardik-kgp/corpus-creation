*** what-is-the-proper-way-to-move-a-database-from-one-drive-to-another-in-sql-serve ***

 I'm not looking to relocate the database to another server entirely, but just move the data file(s) and log file to another drive with more space. I've seen conflicting directions on how to do this, so I'm looking for the recommended proper way of doing it. 
 
 **Detach the Database:**

 
 **Move the Database files (Xcopy through xp_cmdshell shown):**

 
 **ReAttach Database:**

 
 There's more detail at this  Microsoft KB article . 
 
 Another way - detach database files (database->tasks->detach), move them to new drive and then attach again.
But way described by Jay S is the simpliest. 
 
 To be absolutely safe, I would do the following: 
 
 Backup the database to a BAK file. 
 Take the current database offline, or delete it if you want to. 
 Restore the database and change the location of the MDF and LDF files. 
 
 Scripts sample: 
 
 
 The first script will get you the current names and paths that you'll need in the second script.  The second script restores the database back to the name you want it to have, but you can change where you want to store.  In the example above, it moves the MDF and LDF files to the D: drive. 
 
 I'd rather not enable xp_cmdshell on my SQL Server instance, so I wrote a function to do this using Powershell instead; it was especially useful when I had to move a large number of databases. 
 
 You can use it like so: 
 
 I also think this method is a bit more robust than the others - what if your database is split into many files or you have a strange naming convention for logs for example? 
 
 I needed to move multiple databases within same server, so I expanded the accepted solution a bit, to avoid copying and pasting or retyping commands. This allows moving data files in one script run, only changing the database name. Note this assumes that advanced commands are enabled; if not, use  . The data and log files are assumed to be in the same directory.  
 
 
 You also need to make sure the user under which the SQL Server process is running has access to the folder. For SQL2014, the default user process is "NT Service\MSSQL$SQL2014".
