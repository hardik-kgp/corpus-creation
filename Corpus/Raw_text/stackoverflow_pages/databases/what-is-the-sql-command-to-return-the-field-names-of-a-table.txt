*** what-is-the-sql-command-to-return-the-field-names-of-a-table ***

 Say I have a table called myTable.  What is the SQL command to return all of the field names of this table?  If the answer is database specific then I need SQL Server right now but would be interested in seeing the solution for other database systems as well. 
 
 MySQL 3 and 4 (and 5): 
 
 which is an alias for 
 
 SQL Server (from 2000) and MySQL 5: 
 
 Completing the answer: like people below have said, in SQL Server you can also use the stored procedure  
 
 
 SQL-92 standard defines INFORMATION_SCHEMA which conforming rdbms's like MS SQL Server support. The following works for MS SQL Server 2000/2005/2008 and MySql 5 and above 
 
 MS SQl Server Specific: 
 
 This solution returns several result sets within which is the information you desire, where as the former gives you exactly what you want. 
 Also just for completeness you can query the sys tables directly. This is not recommended as the schema can change between versions of SQL Server and INFORMATION_SCHEMA is a layer of abstraction above these tables. But here it is anyway for SQL Server 2000 
 
 
 You can use the provided system views to do this: 
 eg 
 
 alternatively, you can use the system proc  **sp_help**

 eg 
 
 
 PostgreSQL understands the 
 
 syntax. If you're working in the psql shell, you can also use 
 
 for a description (columns, and their datatypes and constraints) 
 
 For those looking for an answer in Oracle: 
 
 
 Just for completeness, since MySQL and Postgres have already been mentioned: With SQLite, use " " 
 
 
 This is also MySQL Specific: 
 
 this doesnt just show the table names but it also pulls out all the info about the fields. 
 
 In Sybase SQL Anywhere, the columns and table information are stored separately, so you need a join: 
 
 
 MySQL is the same: 
 
 
 If you just want the column names, then 
 
 On MS SQL Server, for more information on the table such as the types of the columns, use 
 
 
 For IBM DB2 (will double check this on Monday to be sure.) 
 
 
 MySQL
