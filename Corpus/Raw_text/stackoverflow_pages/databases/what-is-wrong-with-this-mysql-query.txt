*** what-is-wrong-with-this-mysql-query ***

 It's 12:30am and I have been coding for 9 hours straight. I really need to get this project done, but MySQL is messing with my deadline. Could you examine this snippet for me and see if you can find out what is wrong? 
 **PHP/MySQL Query**

 
 Keeps returning the following error... 
 
 MYSQL Error [Oct 6th, 2010 11:31pm CDT] 
  You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '* FROM bans WHERE ip='206.53.90.231'' at line 1 (1064) 
 
 I do not see anything wrong with the query. I've even tried different methods of including the variable  **$ip**
 but with no avail. 
 **EDIT:**

Just to add in here, the  **ip**
 column in my database is a varchar(255). 
 **EDIT 2:**

Here is the whole affected code. Keep in mind that this is all in a class. If I'm missing something, let me know. 
 Line from another Function 
 
 Affected Function 
 
 unbanUser function 
 
 
 I think it may be  It is your   statement which is causing the error. 
 Remove the   after the   and it should be fine. 
 
 Try this: 
 
 
 Check if you are using the ' character or the Â´ character (the last one is an accent)
