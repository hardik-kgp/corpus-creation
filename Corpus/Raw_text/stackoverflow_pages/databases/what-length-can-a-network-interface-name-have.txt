*** what-length-can-a-network-interface-name-have ***

 I need to adjust some database tables in order to accommodate 50+ character long network interface names.
I wonder if there is a standard on how long an interface name can be, so I can map it correctly. 
 
 As far as the Linux-specific part of this, in recent kernel versions this is defined by  IFNAMSIZ  to be 16 bytes, so 15 user-visible bytes (assuming it includes a trailing null).    is used in defining struct net_device's name field  here . 
 In order to test empirically, you can use the following to see that 16 bytes fails and 15 bytes works: 
 
 (Assuming you have   from the iproute2 package installed, as is likely on any Linux distribution from within the last decade or so.) 
 
 Also, if you want to use the interface with DHCP, the name must have length  < 14, due to this issue:
