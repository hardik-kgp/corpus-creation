 Is there a Node.JS Driver for MySQL that is commonly used other than  node-mysql? 
 (It seems like there is not much activity with node.js database drivers. Is there a reason for this or is it just because Node.JS is so young?) 
 
 Here are some options: 
 
 http://github.com/felixge/node-mysql  (last update: Sep 29th) 
 https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2  (last update: Sep 04, 2018) 
 
 
 You can also try out a newer effort known as  Node.js DB  that aims to provide a common framework for several database engines. It is built with C++ so performance is guaranteed. 
 Specifically you could use its db-mysql driver for  Node.js MySQL support . 
 
 Just look at  https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient . 
 
 If you need an ORM for MySQL you might want to check out  http://sequelizejs.com  :) 
 
 For connecting to MySQL with node.js, I've had great success using  node-odbc 
 It's also worked flawlessly for connecting to other databases such as IBM's DB2, and it's been surprisingly fast. 
 This page  is particularly useful for configuring ODBC on linux. 
 After installing with  , my /etc/odbc.ini file looks like this: 
 
 I left out stuff such as server, user, database, port, password etc. so that I can set these from my connection string (I need to connect to multiple databases). 
 After saving /etc/odbc.ini, it's installed with this command:  
 And here's a code sample for testing it out: 
 
 Or if you wanted to use coffeescript:
