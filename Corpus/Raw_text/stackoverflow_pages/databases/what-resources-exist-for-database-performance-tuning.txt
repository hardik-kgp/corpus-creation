 What good resources exist for understanding database tuning on the major engines and advancing your knowledge in that area? 
 The idea of this question is to collect the shed load of resources that invariably exist, so that people can have a "one stop" knowledge shop of the good, peer approved resources.

 Oracle's very own Tom Kyte has a fantastic repository on every type of performance problem imaginable on  http://asktom.oracle.com .  He usually takes the time to recreate specific problems and gives very detailed explanations. 
 
 This guy's answer to a not-the-same-inquiry is probably a good start. 
 Hidden Features of MySQL 
 
 And something for PostgreSQL:  "Performance Optimization"  at the official  wiki . 
 
 If you are using an Oracle database, this guide may also help.
 http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28274/toc.htm 
 
 For MySQL, the performance tuning 'bible' is  High Performance MySQL 
 
 Quick PostgreSQL Optimization  (query optimizing) 
 Short read, explains a lot of things well and 'works' a real example which is nice for those of us that learn better that way. 
 After seeing the wiki link to PostgreSQL, figured I'd edit this post with links for  mysql / oracle  docs, not really an optimization guides specifically but both are good resources, especially the mysql one. For optimization and any other tuning features. 
 
 SO has a good one here:  How do you interpret a queryâ€™s explain plan? 
 
 A lot of good MySQL specific tips can be found at  http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/ 
 
 I would add that besides having your database theoretically tuned, you should profile your application using a profiler that tracks SQL calls.   
 Despite your best intentions, a few bad calls will sneak into your application and will often cause 90% of your performance-related problems. 
 
 If you are looking for SQL Server specific Performance tuning references there are an absolute shed load of quality resources available online, ranging from white papers on implementing specific technologies such as partitioning, to excellent Blogs that detail step by step instruction on how to performance tune a sql server platform. 
 Shameless plug follows: You can start you research by reviewing the performance tuning area of my personal Blog, or for any specific SQL Server requirements/issues feel free to fire me an email. 
 SQL Server Resources

Decent site for MSSQL specific info. 
 
 
 Book: Troubleshooting Oracle Performance (Antognini Christian) 
 
 
 How to Identify Slow Running Queries with SQL Profiler  is a good tutorial on how to go about identifying slow running queries.  This will allow one to focus their attention where it is most needed.

 The whole  Performance Tips  chapter in the PostgreSQL docs is worth reading.

 Here is another highly-regarded book that is platform-neutral: 
 Dan Tow's  SQL Tuning: Generating Optimal Execution Plans 
 Contains some specific examples for Oracle, MS SQL, and IBM DB2, but the techniques involved should apply to other platforms, too. 
 
 For SQL Server, I primarily use: 
 
 Brent Ozar's Perf Tuning Page 
 SqlServerPedia's Perf Tuning Page 
 
 
 Xaprb  is a must-read blog for MySQL DBAs. The author has written a book on  high-performance MySQL 
 For the happy few working with Sybase SQL Anywhere I can only recommend  Breck Carter's blog  and his  SQL Anywhere Studio 9 Developer's Guide 
 
 I was pretty happy when I saw this way of quickly seeing what happened with a SQL statement you are tuning under Oracle.  Change the first SQL statement below to your SELECT statement and keep that hint in there. 
 
 Where: 
 
 E-Rows is estimated rows. 
 A-Rows is actual rows. 
 A-Time is actual time. 
 Buffers is actual buffers. 
 
 Where the estimated plan varies from the actual execution by orders of magnitude, you know you have problems. 
 
 For people working with Oracle I recommend this link.............

 From my experiences with Oracle database development, I have found that building up a knowledge of how to use SQL, how it works and knowing what is available (supplied functions, clauses that you didn't know existed or enhanced from the last version)  means I spend a lot less time having to tune sql.  
 
 I'd start out by understanding how the database works at a fundamental level.  How is data stored on disk, what does creating an index do, how does query plan optimization work, how are plans cached, when to cached plans expire. 
 If you can commit all that to memory, most of the advice about tuning seems obvious. 
 Here's a great book for MSSQL 
 SQL Server Internals 
 
 For Oracle,  Cost-Based Oracle: Fundamentals  by  Jonathan Lewis . 
 
 Sometimes you need to know to how to fix the problem once it is identified. This will show ways to replace a badly performing cursor with a set-based operation:
 http://wiki.lessthandot.com/index.php/Cursors_and_How_to_Avoid_Them 
 It was specific to SQL Server but many of the techniques might transalte to other dbs as well.  
 
 For Microsoft SQL, I'd recommend the books by Kalen Delaney (et al) called "Inside SQL Server". They offer a good insight into the internals of SQL Server, thus allowing readers to educate themselves on why particular statements might be faster than others. 
 Inside SQL Server 7.0   
 Inside SQL Server 2000   
 Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2005   
 Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Internals   
 There's also a book dedicated to performance tuning of SQL Server 2008 queries:
 SQL Server Performance Tuning Distilled   
 I also like the blogs by Paul Randal and Kimberly Tripp on SQLSkills.com. They are full of solid SQL advice: 
 Paul's blog   
 Kimberly's blog   
 
 For SQL Server performance tuning, Itzik Ben-Gan is a legend.  
 You can find his many detailed books here, all with his usual style of empirical measurement to prove his case:  http://tsql.solidq.com/books/index.htm 
 If you're searching for the fastest solution to a t-sql problem add the word 'itzik' to your google search term. 
 Itzik Ben-Gan has been mentioned  over 600 times here on stackoverflow , but I couldn't believe it to find not a single mention of him here on this performance tuning question. 
 As an additional resource, you can also find some videos of  Itzik talking about performance related stuff here on youtube .
