 Modeling tool or just a visual tool for drawing.
In fact I only need to draw and later I'll transform the picture into sql by hand
to better control the process. 
 
 Why don't you use MySQL Workbench, which is free and very good tool to plan and create database model. I like it. Besides it allows you to synchronize your model with the DB or vice versa. I haven't met any good tool like MySQL Workbench. 
 
 **Paper and Pencil**

 
 Actually I just use either a pen and a bit of paper or, if I'm feeling really adventurous, gVim. 
 Then I just build the SQL out of that with some ad-hoc macros. Yes, I know I'm a luddite but I've never really found any advantages to database designer tools to justify the pain of learning them. There's plenty of other things to learn where the return on investment is better and more immediate. 
 But then again, I always opt for simplicity in the schema design to make my job a lot easier. I only worry about using advanced features of SQL or the DBMS if performance becomes a measurable problem. 
 Maybe it's because I was burnt badly by Rational System Architect in my "youth" :-) 
 
 I have used  Dia , which has a companion  dia2code  to generate code for both SQL and any number of programming languages. 
 
 If MS Visio was already suggested, take a look at free-of-charge alternative ARIS Express ( http://www.ariscommunity.com/aris-express ). It has ERM diagrams. 
 
 SmartDraw - For ER diagrams, Its one of the best I have seen so far. 
 
 Enterprise Architect from Sparx System. It is single point OOAD and DB-schema designer for me. 
 
 I have good results with  FabForce DBDesigner 4 
 
 GPL License  
 works on Windows/Linux 
 Reverse engineering (from any ODBC source) 
 Save as SQL script 
 
 The only drawback is that DBDesigner isn't too good for printing large database drawings. You need to screenshot & jigsaw the screens in an external program to get a clean printout. 
 
 Microsoft Visio is pretty good. You can generate an ERD diagram from an existing schema in the database. 
 
 SQL Developer Data Modeler  is good one. We used it sometimes to share ideas. Otherwise I just scribble.
