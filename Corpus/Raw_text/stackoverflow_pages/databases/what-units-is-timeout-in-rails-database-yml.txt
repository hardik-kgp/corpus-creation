*** what-units-is-timeout-in-rails-database-yml ***

 In database.yml, is the timeout in seconds or milliseconds? And what specifically is it, the timeout for the entire database connection including wait time for a connection or something else? 
 
 the timeout is in milliseconds. This is the entire time which rails app wait for database response. Good practice is to add reconnect option in this file then the application will try reconnecting to the server before giving up in case of a lost connection. 
 
 Number of seconds to block and wait for a connection before giving up and raising a timeout error (default 5 seconds). 
 
 MYSQL Docs say :

 mysql is mapped to  **timeout**
 defined in  **data_base.yml**
 rails which is set to 5 seconds default.
