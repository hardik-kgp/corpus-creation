*** whats-a-zip-join-have-you-ever-heard-of-that-or-a-pairwise-join ***

 This section of Slick's documentation page  is quite odd.  
 What is this zip join? It says that it means: 
 
 a pairwise join of two queries 
 
 but what that means @.@ I don't know 
 I've tried Googling for both "zip join" and "pairwise join"... but no results to do with databases.  
 I do get  this  from Wikipedia when I search on "pairwise" though... 
 
Could somebody give me some examples illustrating the differences between a zip join and a normal outer or inner join? Thanks! 
 
 Zip joins are only meaningful when talking about ordered sets.  Instead of joining based on the value of a column, you are joining based on the row number. 
 Table1 
 
 Table2 
 
 **Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON [color] = [flame]**
 : only matching rows 
 
 **Table1 OUTER JOIN Table2 ON [color] = [flame]**
 : all rows, matched where possible 
 
 **Table1 "zip joined" to Table2**
 : all rows, regardless of match 
 
 Zip joins are combining the data like a zipper, pairing the first row from one table with the first row from the other, second paired with second, etc.  It's not actually looking at that data.  They can be generated very quickly, but they won't mean anything unless there is some meaningful order already present in your data or if you just want to generate random pairings
