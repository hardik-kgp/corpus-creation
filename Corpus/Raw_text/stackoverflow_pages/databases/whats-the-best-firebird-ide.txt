 Simple question. I'm considering Firebird and SQLite for an upcoming project. SQLite has SQLite Administrator, which is pretty good but gets +1M because it has autocomplete. But Firebird supports FKs, so I'm more comfortable with it. I'm leaning toward Firebird right now.  
 What is your favorite Firebird IDE and why?  
 Edit: Personally, I'll be gravitating toward the free ones because I'm not making much on this project. But I'll leave the question as is.  
 
 I like  IBExpert  for Firebird (or Interbase). They have a free personal edition. 
 
 Test all this !

 For me the best is  **IBExpert**
 and after Database Workbench because they have stored procedure debugger 
 (*) means free or have free version (personal...) 
 
 I would not want to enter it into a contest for best Firebird IDE (yet), but you could look into  FlameRobin  for a free multi-platform administration program for Firebird. It has auto completion, starts as fast as no other GUI tool I know of, and the price should be right for you. 
 
 Databaseworkbench - does everthing - SQL Developer's heaven 
 
 I have used the free version of EMS SQL Manager. It is a great IDE with all the features I ever need and compares with something like Management Studio for SQL Server.  Link 
 
 I can suggest you  Firebird Maestro . It's not free but what you get for the price of a license is a very good product, especially because you can perform most of your tasks visually. 
 
 Aside from an IDE for Firebird, you may want to take a look at  Sin√°tica Monitor for Firebird . 
It's great for finding bottlenecks. 
 
 I guess you are looking for  AnySQL Maestro 
 
 Freeware
 Able to work with Firebird and SQLite databases at the same time
 
 The producer also offers a tool for SQLite (SQLite Maestro) that SUPPORTS FOREIGN KEYS (with referential integrity triggers) but it has only 30-day free trial (costs about $70). 
 
 FlameRobin is simple, easy to use, and has a small footprint. Additionally, it's free.
