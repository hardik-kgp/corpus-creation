*** whats-the-best-way-to-migrate-a-django-db-from-sqlite-to-mysql ***

 I need to migrate my db from sqlite to mysql, and the various tools/scripts out there are too many for me to easily spot the safest and most elegant solution. 
 This seemed to me nice  http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/14/  but appears to be 3 years since getting an update which is worrying.. 
 Can you recommend a solution that is known to be reliable with Django 1.1.1 ?  
 
 Execute: 
 
 Next, change your settings.py to the mysql database. 
 Finally: 
 
 
 After some hard searching I got several problems that I hope future answer looking people will find useful. 
 my formula is 
 
 
 Change settings.py to your mysql 
 Make sure you can connect on your mysql (permissions,etc) 
 
 Exclude contentype data with this snippet in shell 
 
 
 
 
 Hope that will help you! 
 
 This is a neater way to avoid the   issues described elsewhere: 
 
 Then: 
 
 
 A (fuller) list of the steps I needed for moving from sqlite to MySQL, YMMV: 
 
 python manage.py dumpdata > datadump.json 
 Make sure you can connect on your mysql (permissions, etc) 
 Make sure you HAVE PRIVILEGES to modify FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS (I had to install and run my own private instance of mysql for that) 
 Make sure InnoDB engine is NOT used (use MyISAM in  every  table) or the next step won't work (failing silently)! 
 Relax validation by this command (this won't take effect in InnoDB):
 
 Load django_site.sql table separately (if using contrib.sites) 
 Change settings.py to your new mysql 
 python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb 
 Fix syncdb errors errors by tinkering with the code in /migrations directories of your Django apps and the DB tables as necessary 
 Exclude contentype data with this snippet (can put it in the main urls.py module):
 
 
 
 If need editing json data have to prettify it first:
 
 python manage.py loaddata datadump.json 
 Fix any data truncation issues 
 Add timezone data to the database:
 
 
 Test the site is working without submitting any data 
 SET GLOBAL FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1; 
 Test the rest
