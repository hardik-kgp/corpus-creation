 What's the difference between   and   in an Oracle query? 
 When do I use  ? And  ? 
 
 I think it serves the same purpose.   
  can  **also**
 take literal values whereas   need a query to compare the results with. 
 EDIT:   could be good to use because it can   with the outer query & can lead to usage of index, if the criteria uses column that is indexed. 
 EDIT2: See  this  question as well. 
 EDIT3: Let me take the above things back. 
See  this  link. I think, it all depends on how the DB translates this & on database/indexes etc. 
 
 The difference between  **NOT IN**
 and  **NOT EXISTS**
 becomes clear where there are   values included in the result. 
 For example: 
 
 **Note**
: They key difference is that   contains a   value. 
 
 No rows returned 
 
 Returns 
 
 
 Not in is testing for the present of an element in a set of elements, so it is simpler.   
 Not exists can handle more complicated queries, including grouping (eg having sum(x)=z or having count(*)>3), results with multiple conditions (eg matching multiple elements), and can take advantage of indexes. 
 In some situations not in is easier to do than not exists.  I generally find this is where I am testing for the value of a key field in set of values. 
 As a rule of the thumb, I prefer not exists as it covers a lot more situations than not in.  Not exists can be used for every situation that not in is used for, but not the reverse. 
 
 There can be performance differences, with exists being faster.  
 The most important difference is the handling of nulls. Your query might seem to work the same with both in and exists, but when your sub-query returns null you might get a shock.  
 You might find that the existence of nulls causes exists to fail.  
 See Joe Celko's 'SQL for smarties' for a better explanation of when to use each.
