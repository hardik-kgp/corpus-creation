*** whats-the-likely-max-length-of-apple-ios-purchase-receipt-data ***

 Before beginning to test the iOS autorenewing purchases I need to prepare my server database. My question is simple. I just wanna know what size I should make the varchar field in my database. 
 
 I was using a varchar (4096) to store my base64 encoded receipts. 
 But to be honest, I couldn't find anything regarding receipt length on the official documentation (or anywhere else). The only thing I did find  on Apple's docs  was that the receipt content/format is subject to change: 
 The contents and format of the store receipt is private and subject to change. Your application should not attempt to parse the receipt data directly. Use the mechanism described here to validate the receipt and retrieve the information stored inside it. 
 So probably going for text instead of varchar really is the best option. 
 
  could grow to be much larger due to it containing older subscription information. 
 In practice, typical size is probably under 10KB. But I've seen receipt-data as large as over 500KB in automated testing, due to repeatedly creating new subscriptions.  
 It's better to use varchar(max) or text where it's not bounded.  
 
 In MySQL, it's safe to use  **MEDIUMTEXT**
 which has capacity 16 MB. 
 I was using TEXT but didn't fit well at one point. 
 TEXT has only 64kb capacity but it's more likely that receipt size will be morethan this after repeated transactions. I only observed this after many transaction in sandbox mode. 
 
 TINYTEXT: 255 characters - 255 B 
 TEXT 65,535 bytes - 64kb 
 MEDIUMTEXT: 16,777,215 - 16 MB  
 GBTEXT: 65,535 characters - 64 MB 
 KBLONGTEXT: 4,294,967,295 characters - 4 GB 
 
 
 After doing some simple math I figured out it was safe to use  **MEDIUMTEXT**
 as each receipt size grows by the factor of ~2KB/transaction and so you would need more than 800 transactions to max out the size. 
Thus, considering a very safe use span of 10 years it'd require more than 80 transactions a month or roughly 7-8 transactions every month which won't be the case for most use-cases. 
 
 May be use   to store the base64. It can hold as long as 1MB.
