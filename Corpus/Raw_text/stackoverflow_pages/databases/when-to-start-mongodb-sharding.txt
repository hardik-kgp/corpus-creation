*** when-to-start-mongodb-sharding ***

 At the moment we run a MongoDB Replicaset containing 2 Servers + 1 Arbiter. 
 And we store about 150 GB of data in the databases on the replicaset. 
 Right now we are thinking about when to start with sharding. Because we are wondering if there is a point where you can't start sharding anymore. 
 It is obvious that we would have to start sharding before we run out of hard disk space, our cpu is overloaded or the overall performance goes down because of too little RAM. 
 Somebody also told me that there is a limit of 256 GB data size after which you can't start sharding anymore. Also I read the official documentation  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/sharding/  and "MongoDB the definitive guide", I could not proove that. 
 From your experience is there a limit where you should have started with sharding ?  
 
 I would start sharding when you hit about 60-70% resource utilisation. This could be both hard disk space and RAM. The 256 GB limit is indeed there, it's documented at  http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#Sharding%20Existing%20Collection%20Data%20Size 
 
 I have found the limit to be based on reads/writes; afterall sharding is about increasing capacity, mainly writes, while replica sets being more concerned with reads. However, using separate servers (nodes) for ranges of data (shard key) can help reads too so it does have a knock on effect for both. 
 For example you could be only using 40% of your current servers memory with your current working set but due to the amount of writes being sent to that single server you could actually be seeing speed problems due to IO. At this time you would take sharding into account. 
 So really I would personally say, and this question is heavily opinion based, that you should shard when you feel as though you need more capacity for operations than is cost effective for a single replica set. 
 I have known of single replica setups that can take what, normally, an entire cluster would but it depends on how big your budget is. As a computer gets bigger it gets more expensive.
