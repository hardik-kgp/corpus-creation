 Why would someone use WHERE 1=1 AND <conditions> in a SQL clause?   
 
 I saw some people use a statement to query a table in a MySQL database like the following: 
 
 But what does   mean here? 
 
 It's usually when folks build up SQL statements. 
 When you add   you don't have to worry about whether there is a condition before or just WHERE. The optimiser should ignore it 
 No magic, just practical 
 
 Example Code: 
 
 Otherwise you would have to have a complicated set of logic: 
 
 
 If that query is being built dynamically, original author probably doesn't want to consider an empty set of conditions, so ends with something like this: 
 
 
  will always be true, so the   bit is the important one. 
 You get this in a few scenarios including: 
 Generated SQL: It's easier to create a generate a complex   statement if you don't have to work out if you're adding the first condition or not, so often a   is put at the beginning, and all other conditions can be appended with an  
 Debugging: Sometimes you see people put in a   at the top of a where condition as it enables them to freely chop and change the rest of the conditions when debugging a query. e.g. 
 
 It has to be said that it isn't particularly good practice and normally shouldn't occur in production code. It may even not help the optimization of the query very much. 
 
 As well as all the other answers, it's a simple technique for  SQL injection attacks .  If you add a   statement to some SQL then it's going to return all the results due to the inherent truthiness of the expression. 
 
 Its just an always true expression. Some people use it as an work-around. 
 They have a static statement like: 
 
 So they can now add something to the where clause with 
 
 
 the 1=1 where condition is always true because always 1 is equal 1 , so this statement will be always true.
While it means nothing sometimes. but other times developers uses this when the where condition is generated dynamically. 
 for example lets see this code 
 
 so in the above example if the  **$_REQUEST['cond']**
 is not " **age**
" the query will return mysql error because there are nothing after the where condition.  
 the query will be  **select * from some_table where**
  and that is error 
 to fix this issue (at least in this insecure example) we use 
 
 so now if the  **$_REQUEST['cond']**
 is not  **age**
 the $wherecond will be 1=1 so the query will not have mysql error return. 
 the query will be  **select * from some_table where 1=1**
 and that avoid the mysql error 
 hope you understand when we use 1=1 while note that the above example is not real world example and it just to show you the idea. 
 
 Most of time developer use these type of query if he is developing a query builder type application or building some complex SQL query so along with the select statement string add a conditional clause Where 1=1, and in program no need to add any check for it. 
 
 The query finds all rows for which 1 equals 1 and value equals 'TOYOTA'. So in this case it's useless, but if you omit a WHERE statement, it can be a good idea to use WHERE 1=1 to remind you that you chose NOT to use a WHERE clause. 
 
 the use of this comes in complex queries when passing conditions dynamically,You can concatenate conditions using an " AND " string. Then, instead of counting the number of conditions you're passing in, you place a "WHERE 1=1" at the end of your stock SQL statement and throw on the concatenated conditions. 
 no need to use 1=1 you can use 0=0 2=2,3=3,5=5 25=25 ...... 
 
 here also you will get the same result like 1=1 condition 
 because all these case is always true expression  
 
 
 i did this when i need to apply the filters dynamically.  
like, while coding i dunno how many filter user will apply (fld1 = val1 and fld2=val2 and ...)  
so, to repeat the statement "and fld = val" i start with "1 = 1".  
hence, i need not trim the first "and " in the statement.
