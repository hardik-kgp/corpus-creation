 I was trying to save directed graphs into databases for further processing and query. And neo4j seems to fit my needs. However, I don't seem to find a good tutorial regarding the following: 
 
 Creating the database and put data in. 
 Making queries. 
 
 I want to be able to do them both manually and automatically (i.e. using a program). The official manual keeps talking about stuff like Maven, Index, REST API and so on, basically things I don't care about at all for now. 
 So any good hands-on tutorial on neo4j? Or any other graph databases you think is good for total beginners with simple needs (i.e. store graph and query graph)? 
 
 For getting started just  download  the Neo4j Server and start it. Then go to  http://localhost:7474  for the integrated web-admin UI which allows you to enter data visually and browser/visualize and query it. 
 Please have a look at the  Neo4j Koans  by Jim Webber and Ian Robinson which are material that are used in real-world tutorials. Otherwise also have a look on  http://video.neo4j.org  for some screencasts and presentations and the collection of  introduction links  at the neo4j delicious site. 
 
 I started a  blog  for Neo4j beginners.  The first four posts are up and they show you how to  get neo4j , install it, create some sample data, find friends of friends, six degrees of separation (path finding), use gremlin scripts and cypher queries.   
 
 Try  http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/tutorials-java-embedded.html  or  http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/  for more tutorials. Does that work?
