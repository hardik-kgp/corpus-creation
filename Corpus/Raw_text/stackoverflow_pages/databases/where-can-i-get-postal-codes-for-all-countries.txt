*** where-can-i-get-postal-codes-for-all-countries ***

 I once read about an open source database for postal codes with geolocation data but now I can't remember its name.  Can someone help? 
 
 My guess is that your lost friend is  GeoNames . 
 
 You're looking for an Open GIS database - the main keyword being "GIS". This will help you find results. 
 The information you're looking for is usually Commercial grade (i.e. you need to pay for the data), but you can see what's available on the open-source GIS websites:

 http://opensourcegis.org/ 
 http://freegis.org/ 
 
 
 Find all countries at  GeoNames  or run a ready-parsed MySQL script (INSERTs):
