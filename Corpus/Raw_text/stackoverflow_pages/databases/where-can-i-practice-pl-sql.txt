*** where-can-i-practice-pl-sql ***

 I will be given a job offer by an IT company, and was asked to "look at" PL/SQL since I didn't have much experience with databases. I have an extensive background in C++ among other programming languages, so I don't think this will pose too much of a challenge. However, I don't have access to any Oracle database at home, so I was wondering if there is a "toy" database and terminal online where I can practice. 
 
 Register yourself an account at  APEX ONLINE  you have all of the tools for free available online, or simple download  Oracle Database 10g Express Edition 
 
 I would suggest a higher priority would be to learn the Relational model of data, then SQL. 
 If you don't start with a solid understanding of the RM, you're more likely to tend to use procedural solutions where a set-based approach is better. 
 
 Go and get the Express version of the database server  Here
