*** where-column-is-not-null-with-kohana-v3-query-builder ***

 Is it possible with Kohana  **v3**
 Query Builder to use the IS NOT NULL operator? 
 The where($column, $op, $value) method requires all three parameters and even if I specify 
 
 it builds and invalid query eg. 
 
 
 The operator is not escaped: 
 
 No need to use DB::expr, Kohana already supports what you want. 
 
 This works with the ORM module and is a little less typing. 
 
 
 Not sure (it's 3 AM right now) but   might works. 
 
 The WHERE clause takes 3 arguments, the 1st and 3rd which are always attempted to be converted to the backticks format (i.e. `table`.`field`). As long as you supply the DB::Expr on at least the 3rd argument, you can get away with leaving nothing in 1st and 2nd args and the following should work as well: 
 
 This is confirmed to work on Kohana 3.2 and above. 
 
 This should work:
