*** where-do-the-created-at-and-updated-at-columns-come-from ***

 All the tables in the database created by a rails application seem to have created_at and updated_at columns.  What creates these?  Are they optional, or does something internal rely on them? 
 
 They are created by default when you run the ActiveRecord migration for a model. ActiveRecord automatically populates/updates them when you create or update a model instance (and thus the underlying database table row) respectively. 
 You can remove the columns by removing the   line from within the model migration file.
