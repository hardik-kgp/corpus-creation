 mysql>  ; 
 
 Data directories for   database :

 **From **
** prompt : ( **
** )  [ PREFERRED WAY ]**

 Use the following to find the data directory using SQL console: 
 
 
 If your on linux you can use: 
 
 On Ubuntu it stores its database files in /var/lib/mysql 
 
 wamp/bin/mysql/mysqlx.x.x/data
