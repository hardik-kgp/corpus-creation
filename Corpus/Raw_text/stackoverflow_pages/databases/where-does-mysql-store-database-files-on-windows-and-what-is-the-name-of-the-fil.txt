*** where-does-mysql-store-database-files-on-windows-and-what-is-the-name-of-the-fil ***

 So I accidentally formatted my hard drive and re-installed Windows and forgot to backup an important database I had in my MySQL server. I'm trying to salvage files now using some software, but I don't know what to look for. 
 What is the path that the files are stored in, and what are the files named (what naming convention, or file extension should I look for)? 
 I believe my server was using MyISAM, but not 100% sure. 
 Any advice would be appreciated! 
 
 You can check   file to see where the data folder is located.  
 Usually there is a folder {mysqlDirectory}/data 
 MySQL data storage: 
 
 The *.frm files contain the table definitions. Your *.myi files are MyISAM index files. Your *.myd files contain the table data.

Because of the interest shown in the question here is more info which is found also in the comments. 
 In Windows 8.1, the MySQL databases are stored (by default) here:    
 The folder C:\ProgramData is a hidden folder, so you must type it into Windows Explorer address to get there. In that data folder, the databases are named  .  
 For instance,

 In Windows 7, the MySQL database is stored at 
 
 C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\data 
 
 Note: this is a  hidden  folder. And my example is for MySQL Server version 5.6; change the folder name based on your version if different. 
 It comes in handy to know this location because sometimes the MySQL Workbench fails to drop schemas (or import databases). This is mostly due to the presence of files in the db folders that for some reason could not be removed in an earlier process by the Workbench. Remove the files using Windows Explorer and try again (dropping, importing), your problem should be solved.  
 Hope this helps :) 
 
 I have a default my-default.ini file in the root and there is one server configuration: 
 
 So that does not tell me the path. 
 The best way is to connect to the database and run this query: 
 
 Here's the result of that: 
 
 If you want to see all the parameters configured for the database execute this: 
 
 The storage_engine variable will tell you if you're using InnoDb or MyISAM. 
 
 For Windows 7:
 c:\users\all users\MySql\MySql Server x.x\Data\ 
 Where x.x is the version number of the sql server installed in your machine.

 That should be your {install path}\data e.g.  
 
 How to recover MySQL database from .myd, .myi, .frm files 
 MySQL directory structure 
 Restoring MySQL database from physical files 
 
 
 Just perform a Windows Search for *.myi files on your local partitions. Period. 
 As I suspectected, they were located inside a program files folder, instead of using a proper data-only folder like most other database managers do. 
 Why do a my.ini file search, open it with an editor, look-up the path string, make sure you don't alter the config file (!), and then do a second search? Complicated without a shred of added benefit other than to practice touch typing. 
 
 It's usually in the folder specified below, but ProgramData is usually a hidden folder. To show it, go to control panel search for "folder" then under advanced settings tick show hidden files and click apply.
C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.5/Data/ 
 
 I just installed MySQL 5.7 on Windows7. The database files are located in the following directory which is a hidden one:
 
 The   file is located in the same root:  
 
 MYSQL 8.0: 
 Search   in disk, we will find this folder: 
 
 C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0 
  It's  , not  
 
 Data is in sub-folder:  . 
 Each   owns a folder, each   is file, each   is 1+ files. 
 Here is a sample database  :
 
 
 in MySQL are  
".myd" a database self and  
".tmd" a temporal file. 
But sometimes I see also ".sql". 
 It depends on your settings and/or export method. 
 
 If you're using Win10 with Xampp server installed, then you can find the data folder in  **C:\xampp\mysql\data**

 Inside the data folder, each database has its own folder which in turn contains the .frm, .myi and .myd files which represent for a single table in the database. 
 If for instance, you created a database with the name: myschool and inside the database, you have three tables with the names: 
 
 Nursery 
 Primary 
 Secondary 
 
 Then, you will have  for the Nursery table: nursery.frm, nursery.myi and nursery.myd. Same will go for the Primary and Secondary tables. Thus, in the I mentioned here, you will a total of 9 files inside the database folder named  **myschool**
. 
 You can then copy the database folder and use it in your new mysql installation data folder. 
 I hope this helps. 
 Best regards. 
 
 1) Locate the my.ini, which store in the MySQL installation folder. 
 For example, 
 
 2) Open the “my.ini” with our favor text editor. 
 
 Find the “datadir”, this is the where does MySQL stored the data in Windows. 
 
 **C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Workbench 6.3 CE\sys**

 paste  in to window file,
and get   from this directory
