*** where-does-sequel-pro-mamp-store-local-databases ***

 I had a few databases created on my computer via Sequel Pro & MAMP, and was running localhost to view them. However, I did a fresh install of Mac OS Lion, and I forgot to backup the databases to .sql files.  
 I do backup my files regularly, and have a copy of the computer pre-install. Does anyone know the path to the db files? Are they stored in a format that I could rebuild, so I could import into Sequel Pro? 
 
 Brian W's answer  didn't really help with me using MAMP Pro (v2.1.4), but luckily someone else did. Location for mine were: 
 /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql 
 They also said that they've moved it to Dropbox and then used a unix symlink for the original location (not a Mac OS X alias as they don't work), that way it does get backed up as well. 
 
 Okay, I figured it out. If you are using MAMP and localhost to create databases, you just need to go to MAMP > db > mysql folder and in there will be all your databases. 
 Hope that helps anyone who uses Sequel Pro / MAMP / Localhost! 
 
 **To carry over previous databases**
 from Standard MAMP to MAMP PRO:  
 copy over 
/Applications/MAMP/db/mysql/ 
into 
/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql/ 
 **To carry over previous database users**
 you need to copy over: 
/Applications/MAMP/db/mysql/mysql/ 
into 
/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql/mysql 
 
 You can also find more informations about the MAMP Directories (including the db files, error logs, etc.) in the Sequel Pro Docs (MAMP, MAMP PRO, XAMPP, Zend, etc.): 
 https://sequelpro.com/docs/ref/mysql/mysql-files 
 That helped me quiet a lot. 
 
 you can get the path to your data dynamically by running this command  
 
 of course you have to change host to your host (most likely to be)   
and root to your username or   in case your using it as the default user
after entering your pass in the prompt you will get a long list of variables 
search for   that's where your databases are stored 
 
 MAMP store its databases into this folder: 
 /Applications/MAMP/db/mysql
