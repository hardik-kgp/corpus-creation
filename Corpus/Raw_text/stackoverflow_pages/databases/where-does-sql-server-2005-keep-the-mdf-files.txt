 I'm upgrading from SQL Server 2005 to 2008.  I've detached the database I need, but can't find it on the file system.  
 Where does a default installation of SQL Server 2005 store these? 
 
 You can also use management studio to look at the properties>files of any database - that will show the files and their growth settings. 
 
 try this, run this query 
 
 in my case on my laptop it is in this folder 
 C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA\ 
 
 By default, in  
 
 The default locations for SQL Server 2005 are: 
 
 \Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\ for the Database Engine 
 \Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.2\OLAP\ for Analysis Services  
 \Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.3\RS\ for Reporting Services 
 
 See  HERE  for more details. 
 Sometimes you can't look at the properties if one of the systems files is corrupt.  
 
 you can always go to  **SQL Server Management Studio**
 and right click on the  **database**
, than select  **proprieties**
, than go on the angle  **Files**
, you will see two files displayed in a table on is  **MDF**
 file and  **Log**
 file , check the  **path**
 ! go to that folder, your database is the  **MDF file**
 !    
 PS : to be able to copy i think you have to terminate the  **SqlServer**
 Processes, that's a little dirty way isn't, but it's fast and i use it, works for me !   
 
 Go to C Drive --> Program  Files --> Microsoft SQL Server --> MSSQLXX --> MSSQL -- > DATA 
 The Data Folder has mdf and log files both. 
 
 You should probably do a database export from management studio so there aren't any compatibility issues.
