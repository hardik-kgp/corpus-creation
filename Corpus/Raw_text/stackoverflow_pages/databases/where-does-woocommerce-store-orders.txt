*** where-does-woocommerce-store-orders ***

 I'm looking in the sql db and I can see something that resembles orders inside wp_posts . However, I would expect them to be inside the tables beginning with wp_woocommerce. 
 Can anyone shed some light on this phenomenon? 
 Cheers 
 
 In woocommerce orders are modelled as a  custom post type  so they are stored in   as you found. See  WooCommerce taxonomies and post types  for a list of the custom post types that woocommerce uses. Orders are stored as the type  
 Separate items within an Order are stored as separate records in the custom table  woocommerce_order_items   
 
 **Updated plug-in version information 8/10/2018**

 Orders are a custom post type. From WooCommerce  Post Types : 
 
 
 Shop Order (shop_order) 
 
 
 Orders live in the   table ( ). More data is available by looking up the order's post_id in the   table. 
 In addition, from the WooCommerce GitHub Wiki  Database Description 
 
 
 **woocommerce_order_items**
 – Stores line items which are associated with orders.   
 **woocommerce_order_itemmeta**
 – Stores meta data about order line items. 
 
 
 Currently the WordPress WooCommerce plug-in version is 3.4.x 
 
 WooCommerce orders are "custom post" they are stored in "wp_posts" under "post_type" -> ""shop_order" 
 if you want to select shop orders with sql query you can do something like below. 
 
 
 You can find them inside   table.  
 In PhpMyAdmin: 
 Click  **wp_posts**
 table, then click SQL Tab and run the following query, assuming wp_posts is your table name: 
 
 Then you have all the data regarding woocommerce orders 
 click "Show all" checkbox 
 Search for "completed"  for completed orders 
 
 
 Depending on the kind of data your looking for you have to look in diffrent places. If you have PHPMyAdmin try and find the data your looking for. 
 
 I recently restored the orders data manually and here is the table I found.  
 
 Make sure your order_id/order_item_id reference is correct on postmeta and itemmeta.
