*** where-is-my-sqlite-database-stored-in-android ***

 I have created a   database in android, I can query it inside my code but I cannot find it on the filesystem/sdcard. 
 I have checked the other SO questions, its NOT in  
 I do see a data entry on my app taking up 52kb space, so its there, furthermore when I run the app again it does not trigger a   meaning it already has the DB. 
 My phone is rooted & I am using a custom jelly bean rom that runs fine for all intents and purposes. 
 Any ideas where it could be? 
 CODE c# 
 
 
 In my rooted phone, it's in :  
 exemple
/data/data/com.my.package/databases/mydb  
 
 
 Go to Tools -> DDMS or click the Device Monitor icon next to SDK Manager in Tool bar. 
 Device Monitor window will open, In File Explorer tab click  data -> data   -> your project name. After that your databases file will open . click "pull a file from device" icon. Save the file using .db extension. 
 open FireFox, Press Alt , Tools->SQLiteManager. 
 Follow Database -> connect to Database -> browse your database file and click ok. Your SQLite file will opened now.  
 
 
 It is there. The only reason you can't access it in an Android device is because that folder is private and cannot be seen using conventional methods, the OS protects that folder and that folder (and it's contents e.g. your database) can only be used by that certain application. 
 If you want to see it, run an emulator, run your application there, go to DDMS view, do to   and it's there. If you don't have access to DDMS, use this ADB Shell command:  
 
 Calling   will give you the definitive answer 
 
 Databases in Android are stored in "data/data/yourPackageName/databases/" by default 
 
 If you are using Android Studios, DDMS is in "Tools" - "Android" - "Android Device Monitor".
Use DDMS to find it like how you would have done in Eclipse.
