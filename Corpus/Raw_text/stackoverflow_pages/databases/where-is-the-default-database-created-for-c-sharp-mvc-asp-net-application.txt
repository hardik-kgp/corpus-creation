*** where-is-the-default-database-created-for-c-sharp-mvc-asp-net-application ***

 I've got new MVC ASP.NET app on bootstrap with login/register script and it works ok, but I don't know where is default database for this app. My App_Data folder is empty. Can somebody tell me where the  data from form registration are saved.  
 
 
 
 This will stored under Sql express that came along with visual studio 12,13  &15. 
 You can connect it using server explore under View - > server Explorer  
 
 Default connection string will be  
 
 So it will be created in your app data. MDF file will be created. Though you can change the connection 
 
 In your Web.config ,look for    
 
 The   attribute tells you which is your db. 
 
 Normally we connect our model or DAL to a databases like Sql Server or MySQL etc.
But as per you question i understood that just you are using a visual studio built-in application. visual studio stores that data in localDB  
 
 Here is something in case you can't see the DefaultConnection and AspNet tables in Server Explorer:
You need to register a user at least once to get these tables created or at least to show.
