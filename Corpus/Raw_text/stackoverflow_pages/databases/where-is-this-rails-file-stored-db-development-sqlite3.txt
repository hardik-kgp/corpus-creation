*** where-is-this-rails-file-stored-db-development-sqlite3 ***

 I'm trying to find the sqlite database file that rails creates.  
 Sorry if this is a dumb question but which folder is this file stored in?  
 I've looked in all of the folders in my Rails project and can't find it. 
 My  : 
 
 
 It's in RAILS_ROOT/db/development.sqlite3 
 
 You can find your database file after you have give "scaffold" command at following directory
If you are in your project folder then
then go to "DB" folder
then you can see "development.sqlite3" file this is the sqlite database file  
 
 FWIW the file might not exist if you haven't done rake db:create yet.
