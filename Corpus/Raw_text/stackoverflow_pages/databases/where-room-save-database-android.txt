 There was a little mistake in my code ,after correcting its working fine  
 
 
 Try out this code : 
 
 It will return the path of your database. Use this exact path to create the file where you want to copy it. It will definitely work as worked for me. 
 
 
 in Android Studio there is a section called "Device File Explorer", at the bottom right. In this section you can explore all the files
(which you can not see in a simple file explorer app because you need to run the root). 
 Make sure the emulator is the one you're working with.
In this explorer you have to go to "data" -> "data", look for the package name of your app and the next step is to find "database" entry, in this folder there is your Room database.
