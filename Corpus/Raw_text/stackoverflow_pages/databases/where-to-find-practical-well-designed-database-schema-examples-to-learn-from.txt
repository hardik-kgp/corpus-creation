 I am new to database schema design and I want to learn more about how a well-designed database scheme is implemented in the real world? 
 Is there any places to find those schemes? Or is there any book focused on explanation over examples. 
 
 This  is a great source of example database schema's. 
 I can also recommend  Beginning Database Design , published by Apress. I own this book and can confirm that it is of high quality. The book looks at a number of real world scenarios and explains the impact a certain design decision could have on the way the database works and the quality of the data and its output. 
 Finally I would advise building some small databases (E.G. contact management, Task list etc). Start by specifying some basic requirements and create some tables and queries. You WILL make some mistakes which is the best way of learning. 
 
 Here is a nice library of schemas to browse through.
