*** where-to-put-sqlite-database-file-in-azure-app-service ***

 **Q1**
: Where do you think is the right place to put a  **SQLite**
 database file ( ) in  **Azure Web App**
 file system? For example: 
 
 
 
 
 other? 
 
 **Q2**
: What else should be taken into consideration in order to make sure that the database file won't be accessible to public users as well as not being accidentally overwritten during deployments or when the app is scaled up/down? (The Web App is configured for deployments from a Local Git Repository) 
 **Q3**
: Where to learn more about the file system used in Azure App Service, the official source URL? E.g. how it's shared between multiple VMs within a single Web App, how does it work when the App is scaled up/down, what's the difference between   (persistent) vs   (non-persistent)... 
 Note that  **SQLite**
 does not work in  **Azure Blob Storage**
, so that one is not an option. Please, don't suggest alternative storage solutions, this question is specifically about  **SQLite**
. 
 
 
 Appropriate Uses For SQLite 
 
 
 In a Web App, your app is deployed to  . This is the area where you may write files. As an example, the   deployment writes its SQLite database to   (easy to see this, if you open up the kudu console via  ): 
 
 This file area is shared amongst your web app instances. Similar to an SMB file share, but specific to web apps (and different than Azure's File Service). 
 The content under   is durable, unless you delete your app service. Scaling up/down impacts the amount of space available. (I have no idea what happens if you scale  down  and the smaller size has less disk space than what you're consuming already). 
 
 I would say the best location would be app_data folder in the site/wwwroot folder. Create the folder if it doesn't exist. 
 
 Web Apps can connect to storage accounts so you can in fact use blob storage and connect that to your web app. So in terms of learning more about it then you need to be looking at the appropriate page of  documentation . 
 In your Web App settings you can then select which storage account to use. You can find this under Settings > Data Connections where you can select Storage from the drop down box.
