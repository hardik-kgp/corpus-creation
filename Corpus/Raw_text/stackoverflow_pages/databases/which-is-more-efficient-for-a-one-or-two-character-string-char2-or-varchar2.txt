*** which-is-more-efficient-for-a-one-or-two-character-string-char2-or-varchar2 ***

 A really quick one - is it more efficient to store data which might be one or two characters as CHAR(2) or VARCHAR(2) in MySql? 
 Thanks! 
 
 In terms of storage space required, you're better off with CHAR(2) because the VARCHAR(2) type will require one extra byte to store the length: 
 
Value   CHAR(2)  Storage Required  VARCHAR(2)  Storage Required
''      '  '     2 bytes           ''          1 byte          
'a'     'a '     2 bytes           'a'         2 bytes         
'ab'    'ab'     2 bytes           'ab'        3 bytes         
 
 See  10.4.1. The CHAR and VARCHAR Types  for more details.

 In terms of space, CHAR(2) is better. See this:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html 
 If you had longer like CHAR(100) vs VARCHAR(100), which is better in space usage depends on the data you have. 
 In any case, in terms of efficieny of queries, it is always a good idea to have fixed length records when you can afford to have them (the DB can optimize better for fixed length columns). 
 So CHAR(2) looks like a win over VARCHAR(2) in terms of space and time. 
 
 I would ask, however, is the efficiency difference between varchar and char worth it? Seems like any performance gains would be, at best, negligible. 
 
 In storage,   is smart enough to store only the length you need on a given row, unlike   which would always store 255 characters.
