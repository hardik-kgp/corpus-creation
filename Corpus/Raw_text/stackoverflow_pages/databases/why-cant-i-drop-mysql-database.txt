 Problem 
 I'm running  **MySQL 5.5.23**
 on  **Mac OS 10.8.2**

 When I attempt to drop the specific table I get this error:

 I ran   and found the   process and killed it ( ). I was then able to restart mysql successfully. However, I'm still having no luck dropping that specific database mentioned above. 
 **Resolved**

 After trying to manually repair the corruption and many of the suggestions and the other answer listed here, reinstalling mySQL was the only thing that solved my problem. 
 On a  Mac  (running 10.8.2) I also had to do some manual deletions for a clean install:

 I would try: 
 
 Backup/save any databases that have important data. 
 Remove mySQL 
 Reinstall mySQL 
 Restore any backed up databases. 
 
 
 I ran into an issue that queries on my databases (named: caloriecalculator) was taking too long and it won't drop at all. I followed these steps below and it fixed my issue: 
 
 See all MySQL processes: mysqladmin processlist -u root -p 
 
 
 
 Kill all processes relating to caloriecalculator as it was blocking my next queries to be executed. 
mysqladmin -u root -p kill 4 
 Now run: drop database caloriecalculator; 
 
 
 
 I had this happen to me on a Linux server, and the cause was a corrupted database directory. 
 **UPDATE**
: one thing to do is to go into MySQL database directory and perform a  , to verify that the evil DB is the same as the others as regards permissions, ownership and so on. For example here the 'original' database cannot be dropped (it was created by a stupid tool ran as root): 
 
 Running   would fix the problem (but check  **inside**
 the directory to verify there too permissions and ownerships are copacetic). 
 
 In the end, I employed the following ugly hack (after trying stopping, restarting and repairing whatever could be targeted by a  ): 
 
 created a database "scapegoat" 
 stopped MySQL Server 
 copied the directory created by MySQL Server, /var/lib/mysql/scapegoat, to /tmp 
 restarted MySQL Server, dropped the database "scapegoat", stopped the server 
 **Now I had a copy of a clean, empty DB dir that MySQL no longer knew anything about.**

 moved the "evildb" directory to /tmp (so that if thing went wrong I could put it back) 
 moved the "scapegoat" directory to /var/lib/mysql renaming it to "evildb" 
 started MySQL Server 
 not sure if I ran any more repairs at this point 
 **and the "evildb" database became droppable!**

 
 My explanation is that when asked to drop a database, MySQL Server first performs some checks on the files in the database directory. If these checks fail, the drop also fails. These checks must be subtly different from the ones performed by  . Maybe in the affected directory there is something unexpected. 
 I think this was on a MySQL 5.1 or 5.2 on a SuSE 11.2 Linux distribution. Hope it helps. 
 **UPDATE**

 On thinking back, I don't remember getting errors about "proc". So I'm less sure that the problem lies in the  directory . It might be connected with the   table,  without  being a table corruption. Have you tried visually inspecting the   database table, in order to find something there that belongs to the evil DB? 
 
 That, or any errors therefrom, could help in solving the problem. You might, who know, have some lines with the wrong   column. In a pinch, you could export the   table and reload it after cleaning (either through SQL or via a disk file). 
 **TEST**

 I have partial verification for the above update. By  intentionally  inserting rubbish into the   table apropos a newly created database  , I  **partially**
 reproduced your symptoms (undroppable database, MySQL connection crashes on attempt). Error number is not 1548 though; but maybe it would be, if I inserted the  right  rubbish in that table... anyway, the useful bit is that by  **removing**
 all references to the   db, the latter became droppable again: 
 
 
 If you using xampp In windows  
 you can also drop your database using phpmyadmin 
 
 go to home -> databases -> click on your [database name] -> drop 
 **OR**

 you can also drop your database manually  
 go to xampp -> mysql -> data -> [database name]  
 delete your [database name] now. 
 
 I had the same problem and all I did was to delete the database directory from the mysql data directory.
