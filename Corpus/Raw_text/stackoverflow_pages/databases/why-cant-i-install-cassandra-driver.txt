*** why-cant-i-install-cassandra-driver ***

 I am studying Cassandra by its document.
But when I use "pip install cassandra-driver" to install cassandra-driver ,failed like this: 
 
 
 
 
 
 as you can see,there is no response 
and I have to stop it by ctrl+z 
 I also tried manul install 
no response again 
 So where is the error? How can I fix it? 
 
 I figure out 
 "sudo pip install cassandra-driver" 
 it takes a little long time
I was just too impatient
