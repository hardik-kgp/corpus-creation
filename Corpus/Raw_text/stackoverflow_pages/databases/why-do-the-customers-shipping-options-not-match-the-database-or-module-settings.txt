*** why-do-the-customers-shipping-options-not-match-the-database-or-module-settings ***

 A client has a custom shipping module in Zen Cart 1.5. Yesterday I adapted the module to be zone-aware (they wanted the original module to apply to the USA, and a copy to be tweaked for non-USA orders). 
 Now I only have one shipping option in that module, not the configured four. The zone awareness seems to be working (my test orders show the USA fee, not the international fee, for the option that shows) but only the first option shows up. 
 Here's the code of the module: 
 
 The admin page shows eight shipping options, with the four listed in the code selected. 
 Here's the relevant database entries, including the international module: 
 
 Updating the _SHIPPING_TYPES settings directly in the database (e.g. setting it to 1 instead of 0) doesn't seem to change anything. I can't find any code which seems to call this setting. 
 Where is Zen Cart determining the shipping options? How can I make it show the ones I want? 
 
 When shipping modules don't show up its usually because of a mistake in the file naming and file structure of the shipping option.  You know how you have to make 50 different files just to add 1 page in zen cart? 
 Carefully follow the instructions here and make sure your naming conventions as well as file placement are all correct.
