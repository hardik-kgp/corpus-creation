*** why-does-referencing-a-sqlite-rowid-cause-foreign-key-mismatch ***

 
 Why does this error occur? It is a  DML error , but I don't know what's wrong because: 
 
  exists. 
  exists. 
  is the primary key of   and therefore constrained to uniqueness. 
  is one column, which matches the fact that   is one column. 
 
 
 SQLite documentation is quite clear on foreign keys: 
 
 (See  here .) 
 You can't use   for this, so just define your own auto incrementing primary key for the table. 
 
 You can not use rowid if not defined in your table, but if you define it as follows: 
 
 The ROWID column can be used to make foreign references, and when you insert a record into the table, the ROWID column behaves like an autoincrement field, it is why that sqlite recommended don't have autoincrement fields. 
 Note: The ROWID column can be called otherwise only it has to be of type INTEGER and primary key of the table.
