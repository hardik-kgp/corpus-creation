*** why-hibernate-always-call-update-statement-after-using-select-statement-in-m ***

 Is there anybody help me in this case. I am using hibernate for select data from db, but when I check from sql debug log. I always see the update sql printed after I use "select" sql to get data from DB.  
 
 Thanks

 And entity class as below:  
 
 
 Most probably, one of the properties of your entity does not return the exact same value that is set by hibernate after loading. Do you have some if statements like null handling or anything like this in a getter or setter? 
 
 An upgrade lock. Objects loaded in this lock mode are materialized using an SQL select ... for update.  
 LockOption.Upgrade 
 It is same as  select for update  in sql 
 If you dont want select for update remove the following code and run again 
 
 
 I had the same issue where a select statement after firing select would end up in a update statement. This happened after I moved from websphere 7.0 to Jboss 7.0. 
 The Object had String property where as select was returning "Y" or "N" so hibernate triggered an updated thinking the value of object was changed. 
 ALL I did was in in my hbm.xml I marked that property to update="false".
