*** why-index-only-scan-is-taking-so-long ***

 Why does executing my simple query 
 
 take so long (more than 10 minutes this time)? 
 Here is the query plan (output of the EXPLAIN ANALYZE): 
 
 And PostgreSql version: 
 
 The index is here too, on the Id field: 
 
 
 Index Only Scan in PostgreSQL has to look sometimes into the table (heap), because index pages don't contain information about tuple visibility.
That's how many rows were fetched from the index: 
 
 (actual ... rows=19517989 
 
 And that's how many rows were re-checked in the heap: 
 
 Heap Fetches: 10351403 
 
 To speed it up, you should run vacuum on you table:  
 Vacuum will update  visibility map , and after that Index Only Scan will be able to perform using (almost) only index pages.
