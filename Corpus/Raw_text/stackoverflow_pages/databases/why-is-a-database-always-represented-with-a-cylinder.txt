 This question came up today and I couldn't find any historical answer as to why a database is always represented as a cylinder.  I am hoping someone in the stack world would know why and  **have a link or something backing it up**
. 
 
 I'm reasonably certain that it predates disk drives, and goes back to a considerably older technology: drum memory: 
 
 Another possibility (or maybe the choice was based on both) is a still older technology: mercury tank memory: 
 
 You may have seen the symbol oriented horizontally instead of vertically, but horizontal drums were common as well: 
 
 
 You asked for more pics.  I took these at the computer history museum in Mountain View, CA in May 2016.

 For memory, the UNIVAC used seven mercury delay line tanks.  Eighteen pairs of crystal transducers in each tank transmitted and received data as waves in mercury held at a constant 149Â°F

 **Williams-Kilburn tube - Manchester Mark I, Manchester University, UK, ca 1950**

 This was the memory in the Manchester Mark I, the successor to the "Baby."  It stored only 128 40-bit words.  Each bit was an electric charge that created a spot of light on the face of a "TV tube."

 It's because people view a DB as simple storage, much like a disk. And disk storage has always been represented by a cylinder due to, well, the physical properties of spinning magnetic disks. 
 
 It comes from the olden days (pre 1960) when data was analog, i.e. round. Nowadays with digital (square) data, databases aren't cylindrical but unfortunately the convention has stuck. 
 
 I always assumed it stood for the round edges of a hard drive platter. The average consumer might not have  **necessarily**
 known what a  **Physical Hard Drive Component**
 looked like, so it was represented as a cylinder.
