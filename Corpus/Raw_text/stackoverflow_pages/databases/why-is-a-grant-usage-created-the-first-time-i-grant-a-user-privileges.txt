*** why-is-a-grant-usage-created-the-first-time-i-grant-a-user-privileges ***

 I'm new to the admin side of DBMS and was setting up a new database tonight (using MySQL) when I noticed this. After granting a user a privilege for the first time, another grant is created that looks like 
 
 The documentation says that the   privilege means "no privileges," so I'm inferring thats grants work hierarchically and perhaps a user must have some kind of privilege for all databases, so this serves as a catch all?  
 I also dont understand why this line has an   clause in it when the grant I created does not have one (mostly because I dont understand what purpose the   clause serves). 
 Edit:  Sorry for not stating this originally, the grants were 
 
 
 As you said, in MySQL   is synonymous with "no privileges". From the  MySQL Reference Manual : 
 
 The USAGE privilege specifier stands for "no privileges." It is used at the global level with GRANT to modify account attributes such as resource limits or SSL characteristics without affecting existing account privileges.  
 
  is a way to tell MySQL that an account exists without conferring any real privileges to that account. They merely have permission to  use  the MySQL server, hence  . It corresponds to a row in the   table with no privileges set. 
 The   clause indicates that a password is set for that user. How do we know a user is who they say they are? They  identify  themselves by sending the correct password for their account.  
 A user's password is one of those global level account attributes that isn't tied to a specific database or table. It also lives in the   table. If the user does not have any other privileges  , they are granted   and their password hash is displayed there. This is often a side effect of a   statement. When a user is created in that way, they initially have no privileges so they are merely granted  . 
 
 I was trying to find the meaning of   and found here. I can clarify that   will be granted when you  **create**
 the user with the following command ( ):  
 
 When you  **grant**
 privilege with  , new privilege s will be added on top of it. 
 
 In addition mysql passwords when not using the   clause, may be blank values, if non-blank, they may be encrypted. But yes   is used to modify an account by granting simple resource limiters such as  , again this can be specified by also
using the WITH clause, in conjuction with  (no privileges added) or  , you can also specify   at the global level, database level, table level,etc....
