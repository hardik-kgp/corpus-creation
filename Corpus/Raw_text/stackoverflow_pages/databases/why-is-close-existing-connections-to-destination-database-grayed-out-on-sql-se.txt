*** why-is-close-existing-connections-to-destination-database-grayed-out-on-sql-se ***

 I am normally using SQL Server 2012 Management Studio to restore a SQL Server database from a "bak" file. I do this by overwriting an existing database. In the "Options" page, there is a check-box labeled "Close existing connections to destination database", which I mostly check because the target database is always "in use", even if I just restarted the MS SQL Service and I am sure that there are no applications using it.  
 Anyway, on my client's computer, I saw that that checkbox to close existing connections is grayed out without any information. How and why does this happen? A google search didn't yield any results. 
 
 I had the same issue. I simply checked the Checkbox BEFORE choosing the source to restore from. After choosing the source the CB was grey but checked and the restore worked fine. 
 
 right click on database-> properties-> Options-> change Auto Update statistics Asynchronously to false. it will solve close existing connections to destination database grayed out issue 
 I hope it help 
 
 It can happen if you are restoring from a version less than 2012, for instance trying to restore a SQL Server 2005 database using SSMS 2012. 
 
 Same happened here with 2014 server and management studio. I could set the database to single user mode under database properties/Options/State/Restrict Access. For me it was set back to multi user mode automatically after the restore. 
 
 Restart  **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)**
 service and try to restore. Not a great solution but sometime it works.
