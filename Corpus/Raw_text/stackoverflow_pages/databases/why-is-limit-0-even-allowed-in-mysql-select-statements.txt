*** why-is-limit-0-even-allowed-in-mysql-select-statements ***

  returns the first 1,000 results, but   returns 0 results. 
 That's not very intuitive imho. For example, dumb old me thought that removing the 1000 would remove the upper limit to the SELECT query, thus returning all of the results. 
 Why would anybody even want to query MySQL for 0 results? 
 
 From the  MySQL documentation 
 
 LIMIT 0 quickly returns an empty set. This can be useful for checking the validity of a query. When using one of the MySQL APIs, it can also be employed for obtaining the types of the result columns. 
 
 
 *Polite corrections are welcomed and appreciated if I am incorrect here, but: 
 My understanding is that LIMIT 0, 1000 is telling SQL that you want to start with the first set of 1000 results in a given database, for the given criteria. For example, if there are 10,000 resulting rows in a dataset, LIMIT 0, 1000 would show you the first set of 1000 results. The zero is like the index of an array in JavaScript - the code starts ITS count with zero, rather than one, when referencing an array item. So item #1 is actually item #0, item #2 is actually item #1, and so on. 
 
 In addition to the answers already given, it is also useful when you want to make operations to a table based on the number of rows present in that table. 
 I.e. using PHP, if you want to delete all entries except for the one with the greatest id from table "myTable": 
 
 It's really useful because if you already only have 1 row left, you'll be left with  , which is what you want.
