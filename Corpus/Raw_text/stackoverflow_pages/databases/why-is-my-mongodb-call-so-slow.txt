*** why-is-my-mongodb-call-so-slow ***

 Alright, so I'm building an application based in Node.js and I am using mongoose to handle my connection to mongodb. I have an endpoint that is such: 
 
 For some reason this call takes 700ms+ to complete. The same call without even applying a limit made from mongodb shell returns in about 4ms. It seems like such a simple query, so what's slowing it down so much? I'm guessing I've missed something obvious in configuration somewhere, but I have no idea.  
 Thanks to anyone who can help on this.

 After experimenting for a while, I've found several contributions to slowness, hopefully this helps anyone with a similar issue: 
 
 The objects I'm requesting are large, so processing them takes some time. For large objects modify the query to only return the fields you need  right now . 
 Mongoose is useful, but it can really slow down when you request a lot of items, its better to just directly interface with node-mongodb-native if you want speed for a call. (This was about a 50%+ speed increase for my scenario) 
 
 Using these techniques I can now process 4000 records in less time than I was processing 1000 before. Thanks for anyone who commented, and special thanks to  Gates VP  for pointing out that mongoose wasn't really a good fit for this kind of call.

 The shell applies a limit of 30 or so by default.  **Try doing from the shell with an actual limit?**

 Also, you may want to try a   from the Shell. 
 If none of that works, then you can take @Kyle Banker's suggestion and check out  the profiler .
