*** why-is-mysql-query-left-join-considerably-faster-than-my-inner-join ***

 I've researched this, but I still cannot explain why: 
 
 Is significantly slower than: 
 
 115ms Vs 478ms. They are both using InnoDB and there are relationships defined. The 'card_legality' contains approx 200k rows, while the 'legality' table contains 11 rows. Here is the structure for each: 
 
 And: 
 
 I could simply use LEFT-JOIN, but it doesn't seem quite right... any thoughts, please? 
 **UPDATE:**

As requested, I've included the results of explain for each. I had run it previously, but I dont pretend to have a thorough understanding of it.. 
 
 AND, inner join: 
 
 
 It is because of the varchar on card_id. MySQL can't use the index on card_id as card_id as described here  mysql type conversion . The important part is 
 
 For comparisons of a string column with a number, MySQL cannot use an
  index on the column to look up the value quickly. If str_col is an
  indexed string column, the index cannot be used when performing the
  lookup in the following statement: 
 SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE str_col=1; 
 The reason for this is that there are many different strings that may
  convert to the value 1, such as '1', ' 1', or '1a'. 
 
 If you change your queries to  
 
 and 
 
 You should see a huge improvement in speed and also see a different EXPLAIN. 
 Here is a similar (but easier) test to show this: 
 
 In the first case there is   and the second is  . Also ref is either   or  . Needless to say, the second one is better. 
 
 L2G has it pretty much summed up, although I suspect it could be because of the varchar type used for card_id. 
 I actually printed out  this informative page  for benchmarking / profiling quickies.  Here is a quick poor-mans profiling technique: 
 
 Good-luck, oh and please post your findings! 
 
 I'd try  EXPLAIN  on both of those queries. Just prefix each   with   and run them. It gives really useful info on how mySQL is optimizing and executing queries.  
 
 I'm pretty sure that MySql has better optimization for Left Joins - no evidence to back this up at the moment. 
 ETA : A quick scout round and I can't find anything concrete to uphold my view so.....
