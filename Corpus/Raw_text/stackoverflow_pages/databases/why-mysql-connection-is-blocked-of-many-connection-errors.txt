*** why-mysql-connection-is-blocked-of-many-connection-errors ***

 As you can see I have a problem on a database connection. It gives me this error:  
 
 ...is blocked because of many connection errors 
 
 I searched some answers but I couldn't solve my problem.  
 I don't know if I gave all the information that you need, so if you need something else, just tell me. I have a database connection from different computers and I had a user created to access the database but it had   in the hosts row, so I wanted to change it with an IP address for security issues and it gave me this error so now I'm stuck.

 or
