*** why-select-is-called-as-dml-statement ***

 I see lot of debate of 'Select' being called as DML. Can some one explain me why its DML as its not manipulating any data on schema? As its puts locks on table should this be DML?  
 * In Wikipedia *  I can see   
 
 "The purely read-only SELECT query statement is classed with the
  'SQL-data' statements[2] and so is considered by the standard to be
  outside of DML. The SELECT ... INTO form is considered to be DML
  because it manipulates (i.e. modifies) data. In common practice
  though, this distinction is not made and SELECT is widely considered
  to be part of DML.[3]" 
 
 But in SELECT * FROM INSERT select will just perform selection nothing other than this!! Please someone help me in understanding this concept. 
 Thanks 
 
 The distinction that people usually make is between DDL (data definition language, i.e. managing schema objects) and DML (data manipulation language, i.e. managing data within the schema created by DDL).  Clearly a SELECT is not DDL. 
 
 Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a vocabulary used to query/retrieve and work with data. Don't go by the word Manipulation, such statement allows both data accessing and processing. As you have tagged question with SQL Server 2005 following link can be referred: 
 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms177591(v=SQL.90).aspx 
 
 The  SQL Standard  considers SELECT part of "Data Manipulation". 
 An early version of the standard is available online at
 http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt 
 In section 13, "Data Manipulation" is defined. 
 
 Why Select is DML statement in SQL?

 The SELECT ... INTO form is manipulates or modifies the data. 
 For eg 
 
 SELECT Column1, Column2 INTO DestinationTable 
  FROM 
  SourceTable 
 
 Copy Coumn1,Column2 From SourceTable to DestinationTable. 
 So Select is dml statement 
 
 selct dept,max(salary)
from emp;
this query manipulate data then display so it is called as dml.
as we use aggregation functions and where clause with it so it shows manipulated data
