 What is the advantage of using varbinary over varchar here?   
 
 Please take a look at this table : 
 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Logging_table 
 As you can see wikipedia use varbinary instead of varchar : 
 
 All of these information are text , so why they save them as binary ? 
 They do this for all tables . 
 
 Mediawiki changed from varchar to varbinary in  early 2011 : 
 
 War on varchar. Changed all occurrences of varchar(N) and varchar(N)
  binary to varbinary(N). varchars cause problems ("Invalid mix of
  collations" errors) on MySQL databases with certain configs, most
  notably the default MySQL config. 
 
 
 In MSSQL: 
 I think the big difference is only between   and  .  
 Because   stores 2 bytes for each character instead of 1 byte. 
  does the same as  : from MSDN: 
 
 The storage size is the actual length of the data entered + 2 bytes"
  for both. 
 The difference here is by varbinary  The data that is entered can be 0
  bytes in length. 
 
 Here is a small example: 
 
 What you can use here is the  DATALENGTH  function: 
 
 The result is 19 - 19 and 7 - 7 
 So in size they are the same, BUT there is an other difference. If you check the column specifications, you can see, that the varbinary (of course) has no collation and character set, so it could help use values from different type of encoding and character set easily.
