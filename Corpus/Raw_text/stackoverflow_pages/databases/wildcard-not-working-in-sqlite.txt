*** wildcard-not-working-in-sqlite ***

 I keep trying to use wildcards in a search in an android app, and keep running into errors.  
 I'm performing a search on my application using the string below: 
 
 when I use   or   I get a "near "%": syntax error: , while compiling: SELECT _id, name FROM namedrxns WHERE name=%?%" error. 
 but with   or   I get instead "bind or column index out of range: handle 0x40cb70" 
 Could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? 
 Thanks!

 The following should work (but I didn't test it with SQLite):  
 
 Please note that "%" and "_" within the value still work as wildcards.
