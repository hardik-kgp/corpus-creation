 Will the   block call  ? 
 
 Yes, it will; the implementation of   calls   (and so do its derived implementations). 
 
 Yes -  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.close.aspx 
 edit: from Microsoft: "The connection is automatically closed at the end of the using block." 
 
 A   block will ensure the destruction of   object by calling the   method. The   method will in turn call the   method and has to wait for it to finish closing the connection to the database. 
 
 surely yes because it will dispose the connection and before disposing the inner logic of the connection calls the close.
