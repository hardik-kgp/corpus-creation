*** woocommerce-finding-the-products-in-database ***

 I'm creating a website using WooCommerce and I want to restrict the available products to users depending on the postcode that they enter in the search form on my home page.  
 To be able to achieve that I'll have to specify the conditions of each product within the database in phpMyAdmin, but I can't seem to find it.  
 Does anybody know where the woocommerce database for products and/or categories are within phpmyAdmin? 
 Thank you in advance.  
 
 Products are located mainly in 2 tables:  
 
  table with a   like   or  , 
  table with the corresponding   by product (the product ID). 
 
 Product types, categories, subcategories, tags, attributes and all other custom taxonomies are located in the following tables: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   (for product attributes only) 
 
 
 **Product types**
 are handled by custom taxonomy   with the following default terms:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since Woocommerce 3+ a new custom taxonomy named   handle: 
 
 The product visibility with the terms   and  
 The feature products with the term  
 The stock status with the term  
 The rating system with terms from   to  
 
 Particular feature: Each  **product attribute**
 is a custom taxonomy…

 The following tables are store WooCommerce products database : 
 
 **wp_posts**
 - 
 The core of the WordPress data is the posts. It is stored a   like product or  . 
 **wp_postmeta**
- 
 Each post features information called the meta data and it is stored in the wp_postmeta. Some plugins may add their own information to this table like WooCommerce plugin store   of product in wp_postmeta table. 
 
 Product categories, subcategories stored in this table : 
 
 wp_terms 
 wp_termmeta 
 wp_term_taxonomy 
 wp_term_relationships 
 wp_woocommerce_termmeta

 Database Description 
 Fetch the Products of Woocommerce from it’s Table in Database 
 
 
 
 Bulk add new categories to Woo: 
 Insert category id, name, url key 
 
 Set the term values as catergories 
 
 17 - is parent category, if there is one 
 **key here is to make sure the wp_term_taxonomy table term_taxonomy_id, term_id are equal to wp_term table's  term_id**

 After doing the steps above go to wordpress admin and save any existing category. This will update the DB to include your bulk added categories 
 
 I would recommend using  WordPress custom fields  to store eligible postcodes for each product.  add_post_meta()  and  update_post_meta  are what you're looking for. It's not recommended to alter the default WordPress table structure. All postmetas are inserted in   table. You can find the corresponding products within   table.
