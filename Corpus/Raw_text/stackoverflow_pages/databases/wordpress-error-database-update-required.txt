*** wordpress-error-database-update-required ***

 I'm currently working with a client right now that clicked to update a plugin on WordPress. He's unaware of what plugin it was that he updated because he's clicked update in the past for other plugins and they just updated, so he paid little attention to what it was he clicked. 
 His site is still up, but when I try to get into the back end using /wp-admin I'm hit with a message that states: 
 
 Database Update Required 
 WordPress has been updated! Before we send you on your way, we have to update your database to the newest version. 
 The update process may take a little while, so please be patient. 
 Update Wordpress Database 
 
 When I click on the button that says "Update WordPress Database" it does nothing. The browser spins and then shows me a blank white page with Wordpress at the top. I'm at a loss because I can't even login, it doesn't give me the option. 
 Any thoughts on what is happening? Thanks a bunch in advance for the assistance.
