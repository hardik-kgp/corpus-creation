*** xampp-mysql-could-not-open-single-table-tablespace-file-mysql-innodb-index-st ***

 I've installed Drupal on my local XAMPP Server. It worked all fine, no problems with including and working with the database/site till i restarted XAMPP. Since then I get the following at my logfile:

 2013-09-02 16:18:47 2544 [ERROR] InnoDB: Attempted to open a previously opened tablespace. Previous tablespace drupal/variable uses space ID: 2 at filepath: .\drupal\variable.ibd. Cannot open tablespace mysql/innodb_index_stats which uses space ID: 2 at filepath: .\mysql\innodb_index_stats.ibd 
 InnoDB: Error: could not open single-table tablespace file .\mysql\innodb_index_stats.ibd 
 InnoDB: We do not continue the crash recovery, because the table may become 
 InnoDB: corrupt if we cannot apply the log records in the InnoDB log to it. 
 InnoDB: To fix the problem and start mysqld: 
 InnoDB: 1) If there is a permission problem in the file and mysqld cannot 
 InnoDB: open the file, you should modify the permissions. 
 InnoDB: 2) If the table is not needed, or you can restore it from a backup, 
 InnoDB: then you can remove the .ibd file, and InnoDB will do a normal 
 InnoDB: crash recovery and ignore that table. 
 InnoDB: 3) If the file system or the disk is broken, and you cannot remove 
 InnoDB: the .ibd file, you can set innodb_force_recovery > 0 in my.cnf 
 InnoDB: and force InnoDB to continue crash recovery here. 
 
 I looked for a solution via google but it seems to be a problem just with the drupal database because it's able to connect with MySQL if I remove the database. 
 I hope someone could help me :(. 
 
 dev_khan,
try restarting MySQL in Read-Only mode with the   option enabled: 
 
 Edit my.cnf - find the line:  
 Comment the line in (remove the  ) 
 Restart MySQL to let the MySQL engine repair itself. 
 Comment the   line in again (add  ) 
 Restart MySQL again and you have full access again without a Read-Only-Restriction. 
 
 Greetings from Germany 
 
 Move (DON'T DELETE) those files, into another folder: 
 
 and .ibd files with the same filename: 
 
 Try start MySQL. 
 
 You can solve this problem by adding a line in your mysql config file: my.cnf or my.ini (depends on your distro) 
 just under [mysqld] add this line:  innodb_force_recovery = 1   
 
 Then restart your MySql Server.
You could have lost some data but you'll get the server working again with your data. 
 Regards, 
 
 This happens with Wordpress too. It only seems to happen with the latest version as I've rolled back to previous versions of AMPPS and it works fine without throwing up this innodb issue.
