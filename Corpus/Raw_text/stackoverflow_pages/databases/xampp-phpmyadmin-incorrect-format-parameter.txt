*** xampp-phpmyadmin-incorrect-format-parameter ***

 Im trying to import the database of my client side (wordpress platform) to localhost (using xampp).  
 Other clients' sites work OK, except for this one particular site. When I want to import it, it just showed "phpMyAdmin - Error. Incorrect format parameter".  The error image 
 I tried googled it, but it's like no one having this error when importing a database. 
 Do you guys have any idea? Feel free to ask anything, I'm not sure what information I need to provide since I just using quick exporting and the import setting I just let it remain default. 
 
 I had the same problem recently. 
 I did these 3 things and it worked: 
 
 Made sure the Collation of the exported database is the same as the newly created one. 
 Made these changes in my php.ini(xampp/php/php.ini) file 
 
 Made this change in my \phpmyadmin\libraries\config.default.php file: 
 
 change   
 
 to  
 
 (So there is no limit) 
 
 In my case, I was importing the database and I didn't select a database and I was trying to import, so make sure you have  **selected a database**
 before importing 
 
 Another solution would be to compress the sql file in .zip and upload it
