*** xml-error-at-ampersand ***

 I have a php file which prints an xml based on a MySql db. 
 I get an error every time at exactly the point where there is an  **&**
 sign. 
 Here is some php: 
 
 The output is what I want, i.e. the file outputs the correct category, but still gives an error. 
 The error says:  **xmlParseEntityRef: no name**

 And then it points to the exact character which is a  **&**
 sign. 
 This complains only if the   is something with an  **&**
 sign in it, for example: " **cars & trucks**
", or " **computers & telephones**
". 
 Anybody know what the problem is? 
 BTW: I have the encoding set to UTF-8 in all documents, as well as the xml output.

 You are right: here is more context - the example is in relation to the ' how to deal with data containing '&' when we pass this data to SimpleXml. Of course there is also other solution to use
     
 
 Switch and regex with using xml escape function.
