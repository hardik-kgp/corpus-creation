*** xml-output-from-mysql ***

 is there any chance of getting the output from a MySQL query directly to XML? 
 Im referring to something like MSSQL has with  SQL-XML  plugin, for example: 
 
 returns text (or xml data type in MSSQL to be precise) which contains an XML markup structure generated
according to the columns in the table. 
 With  SQL-XML  there is also an option of explicitly defining the output XML structure like this: 
 
 which generates an XML code as follows: 
 
 Do you have any clues how to achieve this in MySQL? 
 Thanks in advance for your answers. 
 
 Using XML with MySQL  seems to be a good place to start with various different ways to get from MySQL query to XML. 
 From the article: 
 
 
 The   command can output XML directly, using the  --xml  option, which is available at least as far back as MySql 4.1. 
 However, this doesn't allow you to customize the structure of the XML output. It will output something like this: 
 
 And you want: 
 
 The transformation can be done with  XSLT  using a script like this: 
 
 This is obviously way more verbose than the concise MSSQL syntax, but on the other hand it is a lot more powerful and can do all sorts of things that wouldn't be possible in MSSQL. 
 If you use a command-line XSLT processor such as   or  , you can pipe the output of   directly into the XSLT program. For example:
