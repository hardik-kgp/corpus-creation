 I am using persistent to save the following records (Time is UTCTime).  
 
 When I migrate the structures I get a Book table: 
 
 and a table Level: 
 
 When inserting a book, the level table remains empty and the Book table contains an entry containing JSON versions of the intended record. 
 Questions: 
 How can I get persistent to use the actual simple types (e.g. int and time) for the columns instead of JSON for the complex types? 
 Does Persistent know how to store a many to many relation? 
 e.g. given a record A with a list :: [B], can I get it to create a third table with 
 
 I am using the following packages: 
 
 
 Firstly, for  , storing just the ID allows you to store a simple type in a json list. 
 
 Alternatively, if you need to query across the relation, you need to define a "through" or M2M table, just like in a normal relational database design. 
 
 As is the case for, for  , the problem is  in persistent-postgresql . persistent is hardwired to marshal   values as JSON, instead of using postgres's native support for array column types. If you want to fix this, you'll need to submit an issue or a pull request.
