*** yii-add-one-more-select-to-cdbcriteria ***

 I'm relatively new to Yii. 
 I fell confident with raw SQL but still get a bit lost  when it comes to 
ORM. So this may be a dummy question. 
 I've retrieved all necessary records building such  : 
 
 I try to get sum of   field doing  . Unfortunately it does not return what it should be. 
 This is how I tried to build in it into  :  
 .
 - no luck. 
 I can get the it using separated query as: 
 
 One more caution - there are duplicate records in product table.
I.e. we have  the same product more than one time. But if I use   it helps to delimiter this shortcoming. This is due to bad DB design and should be fixed in the future.  
 The problem is that I  need somehow to bind it with  , because it's used by   and   is used by  .  
 Any tips how to connect these two question in one  ? 
 Thanks in advance 
 **EDIT**

 Looking at the current answers I feel I need summarize. The main problem is that I need to tell   to retrieve records (bound by HAS_Many connections) and to calculate SUM of all these records and to make   to do GROUP BY of these records.
No other way. I can't do it explicitly. Because I pass   to   and it should run queries. This is how things work in Yii (as far as I understand). 
 
 You also don't have to pass all elements to criteria. Try to split criteria into more code like this: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I don't see why something like this shouldn't work: 
 
 Since you're setting   to true, the columns of your relation should be available to your query, aliased by the relation's name (product). (Note: to access the result of SUM(product.local_rest) on the models returned by CActiveDataProvider, you'll need to set   as a public property on the class of the returned models.) 
 Alternatively, if you're more comfortable writing raw SQL, you could use CDbCommand to generate an array of results, and then use CArrayDataProvider instead of CActiveDataProvider.  http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CArrayDataProvider
