*** you-have-specified-an-invalid-database-connection-group-codeigniter-error ***

 i'm making a CRUD from a tutorial. And i'm getting this error. 
 
 **You have specified an invalid database connection group.**

 
 What would be the problem? 
 **database.php**
 - database config 
 
 **users_model.php**
 -model 
 
 **users.php**
 - controller 
 
 **show_users.php**
 - html views

then  
 
 add this in model
