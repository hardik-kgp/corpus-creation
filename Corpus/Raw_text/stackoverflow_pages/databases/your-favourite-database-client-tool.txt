 Wondering what is the best or most popular database client tool.  Similar to Microsoft's SQL management studio, but one that can work with various databases.  Other tools I have found are: 
 
 Toad for SQL Server 
 Database fishing tool 
 Apex SQL Studio 
 
 Some of these tools can even compare and sync database schema's and some cases the data itself as well.  Very useful when deploying applications for example from a pre-production environment to production environment. 
 So what's your favourite database manager ?  Maybe there is a nice open source tool out there that is well rounded with the most useful features. 
 
 **SQuirreL SQL**

 
 Open source 
 Works with many databases 
 
 
 SqlDbx - www.sqldbx.com - has a free edition, is portable  and works with quite a few dbs. 
 Also AnySQL Maestro -  http://www.sqlmaestro.com/products/anysql/maestro/   
 
 I use  **PL/SQL Developer**
, as soon as I have to work on an Oracle Database. I like the UI, simple and fast. 
 
 I'm using Aqua Data Studio for many years now and it is the most valuable of all my tools - see  Aquafold 
 
 I use Navicat myself. It supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle. 
 
 SQL Developer is nice for Oracle and has plugins for several other databases.

 Eclipse Data Tools Platform  within Eclipse (my primary IDE): 
 
 Open source, works with many databases 
 Do all the basics and some advanced stuff. In recent versions you can find some kind of  visual query builder  as well.  
 Oracle has a  plugin  where implemented some Oracle-specific functions. 
 
 
 If you are using PostgreSQL (and, really, you should be!),  PgAdmin  rocks. It lets you query, explore tables, do administrative tasks, manage users, visually explain complex queries, graphically build queries and much more. It runs on Windows, Linux and OS X and can connect to local or remote PostgreSQL servers. 
 
 DbVisualizer  - there's a free version with a bit limited functionality and a fully fledged one for $149. 
 
 If your're using MS Sql Server, try using  LinqPad ; it's much more lightweight than the Management Studio, and you'll be practicing writing queries in linq in the meantime as well. 
 
 (source:  linqpad.net )   
 
 I prefer... 
 
 PL/SQL Developer  for Oracle 
 The inbuilt tool for MSSQL 
 The inbuilt tool for DB2 
 
 
 RazorSQL  - it works with pretty much any database you can think of. 
 
 Any comments on  LyteRAD ? Not a pure database management tool, but good for creating and prototyping db apps quickly. 
 
 I've used  Query Express  and it's great because it's actually a  standalone 100 KB file , no installation needed. It only does querying but it's fast and free. 
 
 SQLyog  for MySQL. 
 TOAD  for when I worked with Oracle. 
 
 
 If you need data comparison, schema comparison or visual query builder, than you should take a look at our  database tools for SQL Server : 
 
 dbForge Schema Compare for SQL Server 
 dbForge Data Compare for SQL Server 
 dbForge Query Builder for SQL Server 
 
 All these tools are quite affordable and have 30-days trial period.
