merge sort computer science merge sort commonly spelled mergesort efficient general purpose comparison based sorting algorithm implementations produce stable sort order equal elements input output merge sort divide conquer algorithm invented john von neumann detailed description analysis mergesort appeared report goldstine von neumann early algorithm conceptually merge sort works divide unsorted list sublists element list element considered sorted repeatedly merge sublists produce sorted sublists sublist remaining sorted list comparison sort algorithms heapsort time bounds merge sort requires θ auxiliary space merge sort θ typical modern architectures efficient quicksort implementations generally outperform mergesort sorting ram based arrays hand merge sort stable sort efficient handling slow access sequential media merge sort choice sorting linked list situation easy implement merge sort requires θ extra space slow random access performance linked list algorithms quicksort perform heapsort completely impossible perl merge sort default sorting algorithm quicksort previous versions perl arrays sort methods merge sort tuned quicksort depending datatypes implementation efficiency switch insertion sort fewer array elements sorted linux kernel merge sort linked lists python timsort tuned hybrid merge sort insertion sort standard sort algorithm arrays primitive types android platform gnu octave
