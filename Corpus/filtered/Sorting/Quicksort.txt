quicksort quicksort called partition exchange sort efficient sorting algorithm serving systematic method placing elements random access file array order developed british computer scientist tony hoare  published  commonly algorithm sorting implemented times faster main competitors merge sort heapsort quicksort comparison sort meaning sort items type relation formally total order defined efficient implementations quicksort stable sort meaning relative order equal sort items preserved quicksort operate place array requiring small additional amounts memory perform sorting selection sort choose worst case partition mathematical analysis quicksort average algorithm takes log comparisons sort items worst case  comparisons behavior rare algorithm quicksort divide conquer algorithm quicksort divides large array smaller arrays low elements high elements quicksort recursively sort arrays steps pick element called pivot array partitioning reorder array elements values pivot pivot elements values greater pivot equal values partitioning pivot final position called partition operation recursively apply steps array elements smaller values separately array elements greater values base case recursion arrays size order definition sorted pivot selection partitioning steps ways choice specific implementation schemes greatly algorithm performance
