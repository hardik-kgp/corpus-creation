aggregate algorithm explained aggregate algorithm explained sound lame good explanation good short descriptive comprehensive small clear easiest understand definition performs operation element list account operations performs action element carries result forward operates previous result element carries forward summing numbers adds adds result previous element sequence adds create csv array strings works concatenate comma concatenates comma multiplying numbers seed completeness overload takes seed examples starts multiplies element sequence result result carried forward multiplied number sequence result continues remaining element sequence live examples rextester zxz64749 docs msdn microsoft library bb548651 aspx addendum string concatenation create list values separated comma simplistic explain intention answer technique create large comma separated data compatible seeded overload initiate updated rextester yzcvxv6464 partly depends overload talking basic idea start seed current iterate sequence sequence apply user function transform set return final post edulinq series includes detailed description including overloads implementations simple alternative summing lengths strings sequence strings personally rarely tailored aggregation methods good super short aggregate works fold haskell longer max min sum average iterates elements sequence aggregates respective aggregate function aggregate generalized aggregator developer start state aka seed aggregate function asked short explaination figured couple short answers figured interested longer long version code illustrate implement sample standard deviation foreach aggregate note prioritized performance iterate times colleciton unnecessarily helper function create sum quadratic distances sample standard deviation foreach aggregate note functions identical sumofquadraticdistance calculated versus aggregate encapsulates aggregator pattern expect implementation aggregate standard deviation functions imho aggregate readability general love select orderby greatly helps readability avoid inlined hierarhical selects aggregate completeness reasons personally convinced aggregate adds readability compared written foreach picture worth reminder function inputs type returns result type enumerable aggregate overloads overload overload simple limitations sequence element function throw elements result type overload overload general seed provided collection case function yield seed result elements result types overload overload imo written succinctly overload function transforms result illustrations adapted excellent blogpost aggregate basically group sum data msdn aggregate function applies accumulator function sequence add numbers array initial aggregate default element
